RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. National security eligibility for a position of trust is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 26, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under 
Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on August 19, 2017, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2017. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 
24, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 20, 2018. The Government 
 
2 
 
 
offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Applicant objected to GE 7, which was overruled. 
Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. There were no other 
objections to any exhibits, and all were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the 
hearing transcript on March 28, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, and denied 1.f 
through 1.i. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits 
submitted, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 46 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1994. She was 
married from 1996 to 1998. She remarried in 2003. She has two grown stepchildren from 
this marriage. She has been employed by federal contractors since 2003. Applicant’s 
husband works as an independent contractor.1  
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant owes Federal income taxes for tax years 2009 
($80,468); 2010 ($85,621); 2011 ($31,410); and 2012 ($18,286). The SOR also alleges 
she is indebted to her state for income taxes for tax years 2008 ($645); 2009 ($2,499); 
2010 ($8,610); and 2011 ($1,461). Applicant testified that the amounts owed are for 
personal income taxes. 
 
 Applicant explained that in 2006 she and her husband started a small business. It 
was successful, and they opened a second location in 2007, which was larger and more 
costly. They received requests to franchise their business, so they engaged attorneys, 
accountants, and a franchise consultant. They franchised their business in 2009. During 
the first year they sold two franchises. The economy struggled. Applicant’s husband was 
working as a 1099 independent contractor from 2009 to 2012. They invested a large 
portion of their joint income into the business. Applicant’s husband did not pay the 
quarterly income taxes on his income and instead invested the money into the business. 
Applicant testified that they failed to put money aside to pay the Federal and state taxes 
from 2008 to 2012. She testified that they were aware at the time they were not paying 
their taxes, and would have to pay these taxes.2  
 
Applicant testified that she was aware of their 2008 tax problems in 2009, but 
chose to put all of their money into the business. They owed approximately $40,000 for 
2008 Federal income taxes. Applicant received a notice of deficiency from the IRS in 
November 2009 for the 2008 tax year. An installment agreement was initiated in March 
2010 to address her 2008 taxes. This all occurred prior to the deadline to file 2009 Federal 
tax returns.3

Applicant did not disclose any tax issues on her February 2014 public trust 
application. She stated her failure to disclose this information was unintentional.4 
 
 Applicant provided a document, dated April 2010, from the person who was 
managing their finances at the time. It showed their two businesses had financial 
shortfalls at that time.5  
 
 Applicant attributed the tax issues to her accountant at the time. She testified that 
she was ignorant of the significance of penalties and interest that were accruing. She 
testified that her accountant was not filing their personal income tax returns timely and 
she thought that the same accountant that handled their business affairs was required to 
file their personal income tax returns. Her income tax returns were not filed timely.6  
 
Applicant provided emails sent to her accountant in April 2012 asking about the 
status of their 2010 personal income tax returns. She also inquired about filing an 
extension for their 2011 income tax returns. She inquired about the amount they would 
owe on their 2011 returns because she was “going to try and get an offer in compromise 
asap.”7 She also inquired about their business taxes. Applicant provided an email sent to 
the accountant from May 2012 inquiring about their 2009 personal and business tax 
returns. She provided another email from June 2012 inquiring about their 2010 and 2011 
tax returns and advising her accountant that their personal bankruptcy was discharged 
the prior week. She testified that she repeatedly was asking her accountant about their 
taxes. She stated in an email to him that the IRS “is going to start banging on my door. 
Just yesterday I received a letter from them asking for my 2010 return.”8 She told her 
accountant she would like to file all past due taxes “to get my total due to them to try to 
do a[n] offer in compromise.”9  
 
Applicant testified that she and her husband fired this accountant in 2012, but were 
unable to retrieve their documents from him. They hired a new accountant who filed their 
2009 through 2012 tax returns, but he was unable to review pertinent documents for their 
                                                          
4 Tr. 36-40; GE 1. Applicant’s failure to disclose her tax issues on her public trust application will not be 
considered as a disqualifying condition, but may be considered when making a credibility determination, in 
the application of mitigating conditions, and a whole-personal analysis.

but may be considered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, 
and in a whole-person analysis.

returns because the previous accountant would not release them to him. Applicant 
admitted the previous accountant was not paid.10  
 
 Applicant and her husband closed one business location in 2011 and the other in 
2012, as well as their franchise. They owed significant debt. They filed Chapter 7 
bankruptcy in February 2012. The bankruptcy documents indicate they had owed 
approximately $421,837 in total liabilities, specifically secured debts ($19,410), 
unsecured priority (Federal and state income tax debts, $120,954), and unsecured 
nonpriority claims ($253,473). They listed their income for 2012 as of February 2012 as 
$18,000; 2011 income was $238; 2010 income was $234,000; and 2009 income as 
$205,328. Applicant stated that her husband was unemployed when they filed 
bankruptcy. He began working after they filed.11  
 
Tax documents show that Applicant’s combined adjusted gross income for the 
entire year of 2012 was $223,000.12 Their adjusted gross income for 2013 was $209,226. 
She testified that her husband was unemployed again in 2014. Their adjusted gross 
income in 2014 was $183,000. In 2015, their adjusted gross income was $221,773, and 
in 2016 it was $328,811.13 A copy of Applicant’s husband’s LinkedIn resume that was 
printed in September 2017 shows that he has been employed by the same company since 
September 2012. It also lists that he was employed for ten months from March 2012 to 
December 2012, for another company.14 Applicant testified that she did not think the 
information on LinkedIn was accurate. Applicant testified that she did not know whether 
her husband reported to the bankruptcy trustee about his reemployment after the 2012 
filing and his additional income.15  
 
Applicant testified that she went to a lawyer in November 2012 to arrange 
payments or an offer in compromise to the IRS. She stated that she arranged to pay 
$1,440 a month for the delinquent 2008 through 2012 Federal income taxes. She started 
to make payments in March 2013 until her husband was laid off, and then stopped. Tax 
documents show that Applicant made payments of $720 in March 2013, $1,440 from April 
2013 through September 2013, in November 2013, and from January 2014 through 
October 2014. She testified that she contacted the IRS to tell them she was unable to 
make payments because her husband was laid off. Tax documents show the installment

agreement stopped in February 2015. Tax refunds for 2014 and 2015 were applied to the 
delinquent balance owed.16  
 
Applicant testified that she also owed state income taxes for 2008 through 2012. 
A state lien was filed in November 2011. She said she was making voluntary payments, 
but stopped because her husband was laid off, and she could not afford them. Applicant 
and her husband’s adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2015 was approximately $221,000 
and $328,000 for 2016. In March 2015 her wages were garnished by the state. She said 
she did not make larger payments to the state because she and her husband had two 
households for six months, and she was contributing $600 a month to her mother. Her 
mother passed away two years ago. She does not provide financial support to anyone at 
this time. The state lien was released in October 2017.17  
 
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2014 and July 
2016. During her interview, she disclosed she had taken seven-to eight-day cruises in 
May 2016, November 2015, November 2013, October 2012, and September 2011, and 
July 2010. She told the investigator that she and her husband purchased and began living 
in a home in October 2014. She testified that they purchased the home in August 2015. 
They did not make a down payment because they had a VA loan. She told the investigator 
she worked part time for a cruise line in October 2014 to November 2014, to earn 
additional money to purchase their new home.18  
 
Applicant hired another attorney in March 2015. She was advised by her attorney 
to not make payments to the IRS. An offer in compromise was sent to the IRS and it was 
denied in July 2015. The appeal was also denied. Another offer in compromise was 
submitted in December 2015. It was rejected in July 2016. It appears that decision was 
also appealed and rejected by the IRS in February 2017. The letter advised Applicant to 
pay the account in full as soon as possible.19  
 
Applicant does not have an approved installment agreement with the IRS. She 
provided documents showing a $2,285 payment to the IRS in March 2017, which was 
applied to her 2008 Federal tax debt. She made payments of $1,000 in May 2017; $1,500 
in June 2017, $1,000 in July 2017; $800 in August 2017; and $1,500 in September 2017 
through December 2017. She made two payments of $1,500 in January 2018 and 
February 2018, and one payment of $1,500 in March 2018. All of these amounts were 
applied to the delinquent 2009 taxes owed. The current cumulative balance owed to the 
IRS is unknown. She testified that she has timely filed and paid their taxes since 2013.20

Applicant provided a personal financial statement from May 2017. She and her 
husband’s net monthly income is $12,530 and their net remainder after expenses is 
$4,101. They have a monthly mortgage payment of $1,800, and three cars that are 
financed for a cumulative payment of $1,500. The statement does not include payments 
to the IRS.21  
 
Applicant stated that she made a dumb mistake and trusted people to do their 
taxes, which is what caused her financial issues. She provided her performance 
evaluations for 2016 and 2017, which reflect she is an excellent performer.22 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative judge 
must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, 
the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a position of trust. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to

classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified or sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as 
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is 
set out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The 
following are potentially applicable:  
 
 (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required.  
 
 Applicant knowingly failed to pay 2009 through 2012 Federal income taxes and 
2008 through 2011 state income taxes so she and her husband could use the money to 
invest in their business. She and her husband filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and their debts 
were discharged in September 2012. Despite having personal debts discharged, their 
 
8 
 
 
taxes were not paid. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and  
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.   
 
 Applicant testified they did not pay their Federal income taxes for 2009 through 
2012 and state income taxes for 2008 through 2011 because they were using the money 
to invest in their business. She attributed her tax problems to her accountant, who did not 
file their taxes timely and accrued penalties and interest. However, Applicant was aware 
of her tax deficiencies when she received notice from the IRS in November 2009 when 
she was arranging an installment agreement for her 2008 Federal income taxes. In her 
April 2012 email to her accountant, she inquired about the amount of tax they would owe 
on their 2011 returns because she was “going to try and get an offer in compromise.” 
Applicant intentionally did not pay her taxes and used that money to invest in her 
business, hoping to negotiate a lower tax payment to the IRS for the delinquent 2011 
taxes. The following year, she did not timely pay her 2012 income taxes. She and her 
husband had a significant amount of debt discharged in bankruptcy in September 2012. 
 
9 
 
 
Their adjusted gross income from 2009 through 2016 was over $200,000 each year, 
except for 2014 when it was $183,000, and for 2016 when it was $328,000. The IRS 
denied her latest offer in compromise, and she has made payments toward the tax debts. 
Applicant’s Federal tax debt is over $200,000. Her state tax debt was resolved through a 
garnishment of her wages. Applicant’s deliberate mismanagement of her legal obligations 
to pay Federal and state income taxes casts doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
 Applicant attributed her financial problems to her accountant’s failure to file her tax 
returns timely. Although there may have been a delay in filing, she testified that taxes 
were not being paid quarterly on her husband’s income. The evidence is sufficient to 
conclude she was aware that she owed income taxes each year, which she did not timely 
pay. Instead, she and her husband were investing their tax monies into their business. I 
find this was within her control. Applicant’s debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 2012. 
There is insufficient evidence to conclude she acted responsibly in paying her taxes. AG 
¶ 20(b) does not apply.  
 
 Applicant made payments to the IRS for different periods and in different amounts. 
She sought offers in compromise, which were denied as were her appeals. The IRS 
demanded full payment in February 2017. Since then she has made payments, but does 
not have an approved installment agreement. Although the current balance owed to the 
IRS is unknown, it is likely significant as interest continues to accrue. Based on Applicant’s 
and her husband’s income and the modest payments that have been made, I cannot find 
that there are clear indications the problem is under control. Applicant’s state tax debt 
was paid through a garnishment, and the tax lien was released in October 2017. I cannot 
find that the garnishment payments for the delinquent state tax debts or the modest 
payments for the Federal income tax debts constitute a good-faith effort to pay the tax 
debts. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  
 
 There is evidence Applicant has been working with an attorney to resolve her 
remaining Federal income tax debts. Despite her attempts to negotiate offers in 
compromise with the IRS, they were rejected and a demand was made to pay the amount 
in full. Since then, despite Applicant’s and her husband’s income, they have made modest 
payments. There is no agreement with the IRS in place, other than to pay the amount in 
full, which has not occurred. Applicant has not completely ignored her responsibility and 
AG ¶ 20(g) has some application.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
 
10 
 
 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
       
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under those guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old college graduate. She and her husband earn a 
significant combined income. Quarterly taxes were not paid on her husband’s 
independent contractor income and Federal income taxes were owed for 2009 through 
2012, and state taxes for 2008 through 2011. Through difficulties with their accountant, 
their taxes were not filed timely; however, Applicant was aware they owed income taxes 
each year, and chose not to pay them. She has made payments of differing amounts and 
attempted to negotiate offers in compromise with the IRS, but was unsuccessful. Despite 
being cleared of personal debt through their September 2012 Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
discharge, she and her husband’s significant combined income, annual cruise vacations, 
and the purchase of a house, she has made a modest effort to pay her tax debts, which 
raises questions about her good judgment, trustworthiness and reliability.  
 
Although there is some mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome the trustworthiness 
concerns. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a position of trust. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant 
failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f-1.i:  For Applicant 
   
 
 
 
11 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a position of 
trust. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
