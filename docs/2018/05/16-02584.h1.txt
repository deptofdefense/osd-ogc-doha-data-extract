Decision 
______________ 
 
NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to revoke her 
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Although Applicant 
has taken some steps to resolve her outstanding tax debt, she has failed to address the 
underlying problem, and establish that her tax problems are under control. Clearance is 
denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 3, 2016, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke her security clearance.  
 
                                                          
1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information, implemented on September 1, 2006.

Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing.2 Initially, this case 
was scheduled for September 27, 2017. On September 20, 2017, the Government gave 
notice of its intention to amend the SOR.3 In response, Applicant requested a 
continuance, which I granted without objection from Department Counsel. On 
September 29, 2017, I issued a prehearing order to the parties regarding the exchange 
and submission of discovery, the filing of motions, and the disclosure of any witnesses, 
and the parties complied.4 At the hearing, which proceeded as rescheduled on 
November 15, 2017. I admitted Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 and Applicant’s 
Exhibits (AE) A, over Department Counsel’s objection, and B through N, without 
objection. After the hearing, Applicant timely submitted AE O through R, which were 
also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 1, 
2017.5  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
Application of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines 
 
 While the case was pending decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position. The 2017 AG superseded the AG implemented in September 2006, and they 
are effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have 
applied them in this case. 
 
Motion to Amend the SOR 
 
 Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correct a clerical error in SOR 
¶ 1.e, and to add allegations ¶¶ 1.h – 1.j. Applicant answered the amended SOR 
allegations and did not object. The motion is granted, the SOR is amended, and 
Applicant’s answers are entered into the record.6  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a systems engineer. She has worked for her current employer, a 
federal contractor, since August 2012. Applicant completed a security clearance 
application in August 2014, reporting federal and state income tax issues for 2009 
through 2011. The ensuing investigation revealed additional federal and state income 
tax issues for 2013 and 2016. The SOR alleges five state tax liens, covering 2006 to

2011, filed in in September 2013 (¶1.a), November 2013 (¶ 1.b), February 2014 (¶ 1.c), 
October 2015 (¶ 1.d), and April 2016 (¶ 1.e); and one federal tax lien for 2010 and 2011, 
filed by the IRS in October 2011 (¶ 1.f). The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to 
timely file her 2011 federal income tax returns (¶ 1.h), and that she failed to timely failed 
to pay her 2011, 2013, and 2016 federal income tax liabilities (¶¶ 1.h – 1.j). The SOR 
also alleges an $822 delinquent debt for a timeshare (¶ 1.g), which was paid in full in 
October 2017.7 
 
 Applicant, who files taxes jointly with her husband, began experiencing tax 
problems in 2006, when they could not afford to pay their state tax liability. In 2009, they 
owed federal and state income taxes that they could not afford to pay. In 2010, 
Applicant incurred federal and state income tax liabilities because she did not have any 
income taxes withheld from her pay, which she blames on an oversight. She did not 
notice that income taxes were not deducted from her pay. In 2011, the IRS assessed 
additional taxes against Applicant for failure to report a $40,000 withdrawal from her 
retirement account during that year. Applicant claims that they did not learn until 2013, 
that their tax preparer did not file the couple’s 2011 federal income tax return or file an 
extension. Despite incurring penalties for their tax preparer’s failure to timely file their 
tax return, the couple did not file a complaint against the preparer with the IRS. The 
couple filed the missing return in March 2013. The tax transcripts show that Applicant 
and her husband also filed their 2009 and 2015 federal income tax returns late. The 
returns were filed in 2011 and late 2016, respectively.8  
 
 The couple has taken steps to resolve their outstanding state and federal tax 
liabilities. The state tax authority confirmed that liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($1,378) 
and 1.d ($7,309) were mistakenly attributed to Applicant and she does not owe them.9 
The liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($12,255) and 1.c ($1,980) have been paid in full and 
released.10 Applicant has been in a payment plan of $266 per month since August 2016 
for the state tax lien alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e ($5,731) and the account is in good standing. 
Applicant has also entered into an installment agreement to resolve $48,575 in 
outstanding federal taxes for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2016. The Applicant is in 
compliance with the agreement, which requires her to pay $608 each month. Under the 
agreement, the payment which will increase to $700 in August 2018 and to $810 in 
August 2019. Although the 2013 ($91) and 2016 ($1,700) balances were included in the 
IRS installment agreement, the couple paid the balances separately in August 2017. 
Applicant’s husband indicated that the failure to pay these smaller balances on time was 
an oversight.11

 At the hearing, Applicant and her husband testified about their roles in managing 
the household finances. Applicant’s husband handles all the couple’s financial matters. 
She does not ask for the details and he does not volunteer them. She does not know 
who prepares the couple’s taxes, but assumes her husband hires someone because 
she has never seen him complete the forms. Applicant’s husband retains their tax 
preparer, though at the hearing, he was unable to provide their preparer’s name, 
credentials, or qualifications. The preparer Applicant’s husband used for a number of 
years, including 2011, was convicted on federal charges of preparing fraudulent income 
tax returns for at least 11 taxpayers between 2008 and 2011. Applicant and her 
husband were not named as victims in the indictment. Applicant’s husband also 
communicates with the IRS and state tax authority to establish and maintain payment 
plans. Applicant’s involvement in the couple’s tax preparation is limited to providing her 
husband any documentation he may need. Although Applicant was aware they owed 
taxes, she was not aware of the extent of tax issues until her subject interview.12  
 
Applicant’s husband admits that they have been in tax payment plans off-and-on 
since 2006. He could not identify specific circumstances that prevented them from being 
able to timely pay their federal and state tax liabilities or adhering to their payment 
plans. He also admits that he did not pay close attention to their tax obligations before 
the present case made it an issue. Applicant claims that she has a better understanding 
of the family finances and discusses them with her husband weekly. While she was able 
to discuss the status of the SOR debts, she could not provide details about the 
circumstances causing the state and federal tax liabilities. The Applicant and her 
husband have not attended financial counseling. They have not hired a qualified tax 
professional.13  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations 
may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgement, or willingness to abide by rules and 
regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.14  
 
The record establishes the Government’s prima facie case, that Applicant has a 
has failed to timely file and pay annual federal and state taxes as required.15 Applicant’s 
failure to timely pay her state and federal income tax obligations also demonstrates a 
history of not meeting financial obligations as well as an inability to satisfy debts.16 
Applicant did present some mitigating evidence. Applicant successfully disputed two of 
the alleged state tax liens.17 She has paid two of the state tax liens and has made

arrangements with the appropriate tax authorities to pay the amounts owed and is 
compliance with those arrangements.18 However, this is not enough to mitigate the 
underlying concern. 
 
Applicant and her husband have a 12-year history of tax problems largely of their 
own making. They failed to manage their tax obligations properly. While they are taking 
steps to pay their outstanding state and federal tax balances, they did not provide any 
evidence to show that they will not encounter similar problems in the future. They have 
no tax management strategy. They have neither hired a reputable tax professional, nor 
attended any financial counseling. Given their history of sporadic repayment efforts, 
they have not provided any indication of their ability to adhere to the plans of their state 
and federal tax repayment plans. Ultimately, Applicant failed to present sufficient 
evidence that her tax problem is under control.  
 
After a review of the record and a consideration of the whole-person factors at 
AG ¶ 2(d), I conclude that Applicant’s history of tax problems render her unsuitable for 
continued access to classified information at this time. Her status as a long-time 
clearance holder is not enough to outweigh the security concerns raised by her history 
of tax problems.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.g - 1.h:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d - 1.f, 1.i – 1.j:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
