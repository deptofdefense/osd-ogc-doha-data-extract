APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
7, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On March 9, 2018, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Philip
J. Katauskas denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
 Applicant’s appeal brief raises no allegation of harmful error on the part of the Judge. 
Rather, it contains a narrative statement about the current status of her debts and her efforts to
resolve them.  It also contains new evidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive ¶
E3.1.29.  Additionally, Applicant noted that losing her security clearance will make it harder to
resolve her debts.  The adverse impact that an unfavorable decision may have on an applicant is not
a relevant or material consideration in evaluating security clearance eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 14-04202 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 24, 2015).  
The Board does not review cases de novo.  The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case
is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. 
Because Applicant has not made such an allegation of error, the decision of the Judge denying
Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
