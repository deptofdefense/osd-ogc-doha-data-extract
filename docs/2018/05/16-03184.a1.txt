APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
November 15, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for
that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On March 9, 2018, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Wilford
H. Ross denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
 Applicant’s appeal brief raises no allegation of harmful error on the part of the Judge. 
Rather, it contains a narrative statement about his efforts to resolve the debts.  It also contains new
evidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Additionally, Applicant noted
that losing his security clearance has had a negative impact on him and his family.  However, the
adverse impact that an unfavorable decision may have on an applicant is not a relevant or material
consideration in evaluating security clearance eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04202 at 4
(App. Bd. Dec. 24, 2015).  
The Board does not review cases de novo.  The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case
is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. 
Because Applicant has not made such an allegation of error, the decision of the Judge denying
Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
