FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.1 
 
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines for all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. The changes resulting 
from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on July 10, 2017, and requested a hearing on August 
9, 2017. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 1, 2017, and the case 
was assigned to me on October 23, 2017. On February 7, 2018, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for 
March 1, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 
through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not 
present the testimony of any other witnesses or any documentary evidence. I kept the 
record open until March 21, 2018, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He 
timely submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through J, which were admitted without 
objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d 
and 1.f. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h. His admissions in his 
answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old training manager employed by a defense contractor.  He 
served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 1983 to September 2003, when 
he retired as a first class petty officer (pay grade E-6). He has worked for his current 
employer since his retirement. He married in September 1986, divorced in March 2005, 
remarried in the same month, separated in November 2012, and divorced in November 
2016. He has two adult children from his first marriage. He received a bachelor’s degree 
in November 2007 and recently completed a master’s degree program. He held a security 
clearance while in the Navy and retained it as a civilian employee of a defense contractor.  
 
 The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, which are reflected in credit reports from 
May 2015 and February 2017. (GX 2; GX 3.) The evidence concerning the debts alleged 
in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d: student loans placed for collection of $20,865; $18,369, 
$8,302; and $6,027. Applicant testified that he fell behind on his student loan payments 
after his divorce in 2005. His ex-wife was employed during the marriage, but they had 
financial problems because he entrusted her to pay the bills and she neglected them. (Tr. 
28.) After the divorce, he was left with a single income. His second wife retired from the 
Navy in 2004 and was working as a civilian until she was laid off in 2006, was unemployed 
for a year and a half, found employment, and was laid off again a year later. (Tr. 29.) His 
financial problems were compounded when he took a 26% pay cut in 2009-2010. (Tr. 19, 
22-24.)  
 
Applicant made monthly $87 payments to the collection agency for his student 
loans from March to December 2013. (AX D.) In March 2015, Applicant’s pay was 
garnished for $8,146 in delinquent student loans. The collection agency issued an Order 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
3 
 
of Withholding from Earnings in December 2016. (GX 4; AX D through AX I.) The Order 
of Withholding from Earnings was released in February 2017. (AX J.)  
 
Applicant’s student loans are now in deferment because he has been enrolled in 
a master’s degree program since September 2016 and recently completed it. (Tr. 34.) He 
intends to start a second master’s degree program in April 2018 to fully utilize his GI Bill 
benefits before they run out in 2019. (Tr. 33.)   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: cellphone account placed for collection of $224. Applicant testified 
that he disputed this debt but then decided to pay it in order to qualify for his home loan. 
(Tr. 20-21; AX B.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: medical debt placed for collection of $118. This debt was paid in full 
in August 2017. (AX A.)  
 
 SOR ¶1.g: credit-card account charged off for $1,376. The May 2015 credit 
report reflects that this account was opened in December 2002 and charged off in March 
2009. Applicant stated that he disputed this debt on the ground that he had not had an 
account with this creditor since 2004. (Tr. 42.) He provided no documentation of the 
dispute or evidence to support it. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: credit-card account placed for collection of $2,540. The May 2015 
credit report reflects that this account is with the same creditor as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, 
but it has a different account number. It was opened in June 2005, charged off, and sold 
to a collection agency in March 2009. Applicant stated that he disputed this debt on the 
same ground as SOR ¶ 1.g, but he provided no documentation of the dispute or evidence 
to support it. Both debts would have “aged off” the February 2017 credit report, because 
more than seven years had elapsed since they were charged off.3 
 
 Applicant currently earns about $66,000 per year, and his net pay per two-week 
pay period is about $1,356. His military retired pay is about $1,600 per month, and his VA 
disability pay is about $855 per month. (Tr. 25-26.) He has about $13,000 in savings and 
$320,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 51.) 
 
 Applicant recently purchased a new luxury vehicle for about $43,000, with loan 
payments of about $876 for 60 months. He also purchased a house for $431,000, using 
a VA loan, with monthly payments of $2,765. (Tr. 46.) His balance due on student loans 
totaled about $81,477 as of March 2018. (AX C.) He is counting on his recently-earned 
master’s degree to find jobs that will increase his income. (Tr. 47.) 
 
  
                                                          
3 Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a credit report may not list accounts placed for collection, charged 
off debts, or civil judgments that antedate the credit report by more than seven years, or until the statute of 
limitations has run, whichever is longer. The exceptions to this prohibition do not apply to these debts. 15 
U.S.C. § 1681c.

Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
 
5 
 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing 
establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, 
significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, 
or other negative financial indicators. 
 
  
 
6 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, ongoing, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant encountered several conditions 
largely beyond his control: two marital break-ups, financial irresponsibility by his first wife, 
periods of unemployment by his second wife, and a substantial pay cut in 2009-2010. 
However, he has not acted responsibly. He has been steadily employed since his 
retirement from the Navy, albeit at a reduced income after 2010. He made payments on 
his student loans from March to December 2013, but he has presented no evidence of 
any further payments until his pay was garnished. He has not resolved the two credit-card 
accounts that were charged off in 2009. He recently purchased an expensive new vehicle 
and a house, thereby obligating about 70% of his income for at least the next five years.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not presented evidence of the type of 
financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition, and he has not presented 
“clear evidence” that his financial situation is under control.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Applicant paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f in 
order to qualify for a home loan, not because of a sense of obligation to the creditor. 
Except for the brief period from March to December 2013, his payments on his student 
 
7 
 
loans were collected by involuntary garnishment, which does not constitute a good-faith 
effort. See ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). The two credit-card debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h are unresolved. The fact that they have “aged off” 
Applicant’s credit record is not meaningful evidence that they have been resolved. See 
ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016). 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that his connection to the creditor 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h terminated around 2004. He presented no evidence to 
support his claim and no evidence that he disputed the debts with the original creditor, 
the collection agency, or the credit bureaus.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).4  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of 
the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by 
his delinquent debts. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.f:    For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.g-1.h:    Against Applicant 
 
  
                                                          
4 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
8 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Clearance is denied.
