Decision 
______________ 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information.  He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial history. 
Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 9, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that 
his financial circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations 
guideline.1 Applicant answered the SOR on January 13, 2017, and requested a hearing 
to establish his eligibility for continued access to classified information. 
  
 A hearing was scheduled for April 25, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the 
parties.   Applicant testified at the hearing, and the exhibits offered by the Government at 
                                                          
1 The DOD CAF took this action under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).

the hearing were admitted into the record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 
1 – 6.) Applicant offered no exhibits, but his Answer to the SOR included 12 attachments, 
which are already part of the record and will be cited as “Attachment [letter].”  The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2018. At Applicant’s request, the record was left 
open until close of business May 11, 2018.2 Applicant timely submitted documents I have 
marked as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) AA through JJ and which are admitted without 
objection.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-
4), establishing a “single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who 
require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold 
a sensitive position.”3 The National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (hereinafter “new 
adjudicative guidelines” or “AG”), which are found in Appendix A to SEAD-4, are to be 
used in all security clearance cases decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.4 In light of 
this explicit direction (and absent lawful authority to the contrary), I have applied the new 
adjudicative guidelines. ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003) (security 
clearance decisions must be based on current DOD policy and standards).5 DOD CAF 
adjudicators reviewed this case using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, 
dated September 1, 2006, which were in effect at the time. My decision and formal 
findings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 48 years old, married (since August 2006), with an adult daughter and 
an adult step-daughter. He has an Associate’s Degree and is enrolled in a Bachelor’s 
Degree program in Computer Security. Since April 2008, he has been employed by a 
defense contractor.6 
 
 The SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts totaling $18,820 (of which six are medical 
debts totaling $1,295) and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in September 2010 (which was 
discharged in December 2010). Applicant admits four of those allegations, with 
explanations (SOR ⁋⁋ 1.j and 1.l to n.) and denies 16 of those allegations, with 
explanations (SOR ⁋⁋ 1.a through 1.i, 1.k, 1.o, and 1.q through 1.u).

the Board stated: “Quasi-judicial adjudications must be made within the bounds of applicable law and 
agency policy, not without regard to them.”)

SOR ⁋ 1.p alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 protection in September 2010, 
which was discharged in December 2010, which Applicant admits. Applicant traces the 
roots of his financial problems to the death of his father, not long before Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy in September 2010. Before his father’s death, Applicant’s parents lived in a 
home that Applicant owned. The agreement was that Applicant’s parents would make 
Applicant’s mortgage payments in return for living in that home. When Applicant’s father 
died suddenly, Applicant expected that his mother would continue to make the mortgage 
payments, because she had more than enough money to do so. She, however, refused 
to continue to make those payments, even though she continued to live in the home 
Applicant owned.  Applicant could not afford to make the mortgage payments on his 
primary residence and the one occupied by his mother. Nor could he bring himself to evict 
his own mother. Ultimately, Applicant’s mother moved out, but by then her home was 
already in foreclosure. Applicant sought legal advice and filed the Chapter 7 case in 
September 2010, which was discharged in December 2010. The bankruptcy discharged 
about $180,000 of debt, but Applicant lost everything and had to start from scratch.7 
 
In 2011, Applicant’s wife developed serious back pain, which coupled with pain 
medication forced her to stop working. When she was working, she contributed about 
$12,000 per year to the household. Applicant lost her income, when she could no longer 
work. And, not all of her medical expenses were covered by his insurance.8   Applicant’s 
spouse had a heart condition that was undiagnosed until she suffered a heart failure and 
had heart surgery in September 2017. Before that surgery, her condition had caused her 
to have two amputations and a stint put in her leg earlier in 2017.9 Thus, Applicant’s 
spouse had a medical condition from 2011 until 2017 that prevented her from working 
and ran up uninsured medical expenses. To aggravate Applicant’s financial problems, his 
stepdaughter on several occasions used his identity to make purchases. She ultimately 
filed for bankruptcy, which made her debts uncollectable by Applicant.10  
  
Just as Applicant was getting back on his feet financially, he developed a 
circulatory problem in 2013. That medical condition compelled him to relocate much 
closer to his place of work, to cut down on the lengthy commute, which aggravated his 
condition. Although the move did reduce his commute, the new residence was more 
expensive than the one he had left. That put a strain on finances.11 
 
Applicant’s finances are stable. He is current on his taxes. He takes home about 
$4,600 per month. His and his spouse’s pension funds total about $250,000, but taking a 
loan from them is not an option. His checking account balance is about $500. Applicant 
and his spouse have made no large purchases, and they do not take vacations. Applicant

estimates that his monthly remainder is about $600, which he uses to pay down some 
debts.  He and his spouse did take an online credit counseling course. Now that his 
spouse’s medical issues are under control, they are looking for jobs she can do from 
home, since her medications prevent her from driving.12 
 
Applicant testified about his SOR debts, beginning with SOR ⁋ 1.a, an automobile 
loan balance of $5,330. This debt was included in his bankruptcy, but the judge told 
Applicant that he would need to enter into a reaffirmation agreement with the lender if he 
wanted to keep the vehicle. Applicant offered the lender a reaffirmation agreement, but 
the lender refused. Applicant understood that if the lender refused the reaffirmation 
agreement, he should surrender the vehicle if he wanted the debt discharged in 
bankruptcy. Therefore, Applicant surrendered the vehicle to the lender.13 The evidentiary 
record supports Applicant.14 This debt has been resolved.  
 
SOR ⁋ 1.b is an automobile loan balance of $3,221. Applicant claimed that he 
surrendered this vehicle to the lender, because he could not afford the payments. The 
dealership told him to return the vehicle to the lender, which would sell it and charge 
Applicant with any deficiency. Applicant surrendered the vehicle to the lender in June 
2014, but he was never given an accounting by the lender or the collections agency. 
Without an accounting, Applicant disputes this debt.15 Post-hearing, Applicant contacted 
the lender and learned that the current balance after the sale of the vehicle was less than 
$200, which he plans to pay as soon as the lender sends him a statement of the exact 
amount due.16 Applicant’s plan resolves this debt.  
 
SOR ⁋ 1.c is for $2,636, an amount allegedly due for move-out expenses from an 
apartment Applicant rented. Applicant disputed this amount, because it included the cost 
of cleaning or replacing the carpet in Applicant’s unit after he moved out. Applicant points 
to documents that indicate that he rented the apartment “as is” at move-in and was told 
that he would not be charged with carpet cleaning or replacement at move-out. Applicant 
has disputed this bill, contending that the landlord improperly withheld Applicant’s security 
deposit.17

SOR ⁋ 1.d is a delinquent credit card with a balance of $872. Applicant claimed 
that this credit card was fraudulently obtained by his stepdaughter.18 In any event, the 
record shows that this debt was settled in April 2017.19 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.e. is a collections account with a balance of $811. Post-hearing, Applicant 
submitted a letter from the collections agency stating that the account had been settled 
in full in January 2015.20 
 
SOR ⁋⁋ 1.f and 1.g are credit card charge-offs by the same creditor of $672 and 
$607, respectively. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted documents showing the resolution 
of those debts.21  
 
SOR ⁋ 1.h is a medical debt for $595. Applicant disputes this debt, because he 
was charged for a medical procedure that was never performed on his wife. He noted that 
the medical records (which he did not submit) described the patient as a woman whose 
physical appearance did not at all resemble his wife.22 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.i is a collections account for a credit card balance of $500. Applicant 
believed that this credit card was also one opened fraudulently by his stepdaughter. Due 
to his stepdaughter’s bankruptcy, he cannot collect this debt from her.23 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.j is a medical debt for $295. Applicant admitted this debt and negotiated 
a settlement with the provider for $150. Applicant sent a check for that amount to the 
provider, but the provider returned the check with a letter explaining that since he 
assumed the medical practice he could not legally accept the payment.24 This debt has 
been resolved.  
 
SOR ⁋ 1.k is a wireless service debt for $225. This is another instance where his 
stepdaughter used Applicant’s information to open this account. This account has been 
paid.25

SOR ⁋ 1.l is alleged as a medical debt for $160. Applicant, however, corrected the 
record to show that it was in fact a speeding ticket. Applicant is under a payment plan but 
produced no documentation of that plan or plan payments.26 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.m is a medical debt for $142. Applicant admitted this debt, and it is on the 
list to be paid.27 
 
SOR ⁋⁋ 1.n and 1.o are medical debts for $52 and $51, respectively. Applicant 
testified that these were duplicates and that the debt was paid in January 2017.28 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.q is a collections account for a cable service balance of $400. Applicant 
denied that he ever subscribed to that service. Applicant submitted no documents 
supporting his denial.29  
 
SOR ⁋ 1.r is a collections account for a cable service balance of $360. Applicant 
testified that this bill was due to equipment that the service claimed was never returned. 
But Applicant contended that he followed the instructions and put it on his porch to be 
picked up by that service. He does not know whether the provider never received the 
equipment or did and billed him anyway. Applicant has no documents to support his 
denial.30 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.s is for a traffic ticket in the amount of $122. That debt was paid in 2017.31 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.t is collections account for $93 placed by an auto insurance policy that 
Applicant’s stepdaughter took out. Applicant paid that debt in December 2016.32 
 
SOR ⁋ 1.u is for an apartment move-out fee of $1,676. Applicant knew there would 
be some money owed, but he was never sent a final bill.  He contacted the management, 
which could not verify that Applicant owed any deficiency, because that management had 
just purchased that rental property. The new management cited advice of counsel as the 
reason why they could not put in writing that there was no deficiency.33 Post-hearing,

Applicant provided a document from current management showing that Applicant had no 
balance owed to the prior management or to the current management.34 
 
During cross-examination, Department Counsel pointed out that the most recent 
credit report showed that Applicant is somewhat behind on some credit cards. Applicant 
agreed that he was behind in light of the medical issues he had been dealing with in 2017. 
The credit report also showed the Applicant had made payments on a couple of those 
credit cards in February and March 2018.35 Post-hearing, Applicant provided a document 
showing that two of those accounts (with the same creditor) were under a payment plan 
requiring little or no minimum payments and would incur no interest or fees.36 On another 
of those accounts, Applicant made a payment in March 2018, and post-hearing Applicant  
provided a document from that creditor that he was now current.37 
 
In sum, Applicant established that he has resolved 15 of the 20 SOR debts. Three 
of the five unresolved debts are medical accounts at SOR ⁋⁋ 1.h, 1.i, and 1.m totaling 
$897. The two unresolved non-medical debts are SOR ⁋⁋ 1.q and 1.r totaling $760. The 
15 resolved debts total $17,163.  
 
Law and Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information 
“only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest” to authorize 
such access. E.O. 10865 § 2; SEAD-4, ¶ E.4. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative 
judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The 
guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human 
behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, 
considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial 
decision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, ¶¶ 2(c), 2(d). 
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged 
in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting “witnesses and 
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.

35 Tr. 62-63; GE 3, Trade Lines 28, 31, 35, and 36 (total past due of $819). These past due amounts were 
not alleged in the SOR.

Administrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair 
notice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is 
not subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). 
In resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant’s eligibility, “[a]ny doubt 
concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in 
favor of the national security.” SEAD-4, Appendix A, ¶ 2(b). See also SEAD-4, ¶ E.4. 
Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and 
confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain 
degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of 
compromise of classified information. 
 
      Discussion 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which 
purportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations 
security concern is explained at AG ¶ 18, which in pertinent part, states: 
  
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  
 
 Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial 
issues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality 
to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to 
delinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person’s 
self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.38 
 
 In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions: 
 
                                                          
38 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  
 
9 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c):  the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e):   the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  
  
A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, an 
administrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his or her personal financial 
obligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations.39 Here, Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility was called into question by his past and continuing financial 
problems. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c) apply. The next 
inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. 
 
Under a longstanding family agreement, Applicant had allowed his parents to live 
in a home owned by Applicant in return for his parents making the mortgage payment on 
the home.  Applicant’s father, however, unexpectedly passed away. For reasons known 
only to her, Applicant’s mother refused to continue making the mortgage payments, even 
though she had the financial means to do so. And, she still lived in the home. Being stuck 
with mortgage payments for his own home and the mortgage payments for his mother’s 
home, Applicant managed for only a short period of time. At some point in 2010, he sought 
legal counsel and as a result filed for Chapter 7 protection in September 2010, which was 
discharged in December 2010. The indebtedness was caused by his father’s sudden

death and his mother’s inexplicable refusal to continue making the mortgage payments 
for the home she occupied, circumstances largely, if not solely, beyond Applicant’s 
control. Faced with indebtedness caused by those circumstances, Applicant sought legal 
counsel and as a result filed for Chapter 7 protection. That was a responsible reaction to 
his adverse financial circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) applies.    
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts are neither infrequent, nor did they happen so long 
ago. A number of his debts were delinquent when the SOR was issued and some were 
apparently delinquent just before the hearing. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
The evidence of Applicant’s and his wife’s serious medical problems is abundant. 
The nexus between those problems and Applicant’s financial problems is also clear. The 
circumstances that caused his financial problems were largely beyond his control. 
Applicant has for the most part resolved his debts by payment, settlement, or has 
documented that he does not owe the debts alleged. In other cases, he has asserted a 
reasonable basis to dispute the debts. He has acted responsibly in the face of those 
adverse circumstances. AG ⁋⁋ 20 (b), (c), (d), and (e) apply to the debts Applicant has 
resolved.40 
 
Applicant failed to resolve three medical debts totaling $897. I have given little 
weight to those debts. Medical debt is unlike other type of debt. First, it is presumed that 
medical debt is incurred for necessary medical care and treatment as opposed to 
frivolous, irresponsible spending, or otherwise living beyond one’s means. Second, 
medical debt is usually unplanned, unexpected, and nondiscretionary. Third, it can add 
hundreds if not thousands of dollars in debt in a short period, which can be overwhelming 
for a debtor. In my view, having less than $1,000 in unresolved medical debts does not 
fatally undermine Applicant’s suitability. Accordingly, the allegations in SOR¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 
and 1.m are decided for Applicant.41 
 
 The record does not raise doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.42 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
                                                          
40 Applicant and his wife completed an online credit counseling course.  
 
41 The two unresolved non-medical debts totaling $760 are de minimis and do not raise security concerns. 
Therefore, SOR ⁋⁋ 1.q and 1.r are decided for Applicant. I have also considered the unalleged, recently 
incurred past due credit card balances totaling $819. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01941 at 3 (Mar. 30, 
2015) (unalleged financial conduct may be considered in assessing credibility, mitigation, and in the whole-
person analysis).  Those balances were incurred at a time when Applicant was still dealing with the financial 
impact of medical issues he faced in 2017. In addition, the record shows that two of the three accounts are 
under a payment plan. A third is now current due to a payment Applicant made in March 2018. The fourth 
account has a past due balance of $153. That unresolved past due balance is de minimis and does not 
undermine Applicant’s credibility.

grant Applicant access to classified information.
