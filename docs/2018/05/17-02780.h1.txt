HEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised by her delinquent 
debts, including a substantial tax lien. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied.  
 
History of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 7, 2016. On 
August 18, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all 
decisions on or after June 8, 2017. 
  
 Applicant answered the SOR on October 9, 2017, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. On November 21, 2017, a complete copy of the File of Relevant 
 2
Material (FORM), containing six Items, was mailed to Applicant and received by her on 
December 9, 2017. The FORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of 
her receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not object to the Government’s Items. Hence, 
Items 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection. She submitted additional 
evidence, which was admitted without objection as Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A. The case 
was assigned to me on March 1, 2018.   
  
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant is 44 years old and works as an operations manager for a defense 
contractor. She has worked for her employer since May 2017, and requires a clearance 
for her employment. She has held a DOD security clearance for approximately 15 years. 
Applicant was married between 2001 and 2012, and has two children. She served in the 
United States Army National Guard from 1997 to 2006 (Item 3 at 3). She received her 
bachelor’s degree in 1997. She attributes her financial problems to her three periods of 
unemployment between August and November 2011, August 2012 to January 2014, and 
May to March 2017 (Item 2 at 17-19 and Item 3 at 2). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a. BANKRUPTCY 
 
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2003. One year later, her 
bankruptcy was converted into a Chapter 7, and her debts were discharged (Item 6). In 
her Answer to the SOR, she disclosed she filed for bankruptcy due to unemployment and 
underemployment, but did not provide specifics as to the dates of her unemployment or 
what if any payments she made in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy (Item 1).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b. TAX LIEN $117,000 
 
In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed an $117,000 tax lien against 
Applicant. In 2015, the IRS filed a $38,055 tax lien, which was released in 2016, and was 
not alleged in the SOR (Item 5 at 4). She has made various claims regarding which tax 
years were included in the outstanding lien.2 Applicant asserted she did not file or pay her 
taxes because she was overseas and knew should would owe a large amount of money.3 
She has also claimed that when she has been working overseas in a combat zone, she 
was not required to make payments. She attributes this to an undated notice sent to her 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from her security application (Item 2) unless otherwise 
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
2 In her 2016 SCA, she disclosed she owed state and federal taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, 2014 and 
2015 (Item 2 at 40-42). In her May 2017 interview, she claimed she did not file or pay her 2010 and 2011 
state and federal tax returns (Item 3). 
 
3 Applicant worked overseas in Kuwait from September 2006 to May 2007 and from November 2011 to 
August 2012. She worked in Afghanistan from August 2009 to August 2011 and from May 2014 to March 
2017 (Item 3 at 1 and 3-4).  
 3
by the IRS, but did not provide letters, statements, or other documentation from the IRS 
addressed to her, substantiating these claims (AX A at 1-3). 
 
In her Response to the FORM, Applicant provided proof of eleven payments to the 
IRS between September 2015 and March 2016, totaling $29,500 (AX A at 4-18). She 
claimed the IRS told her in December 2017 that the outstanding balance on her lien is 
$61,937.56 and she is not required to make payments. However, she provided no 
documentation from the IRS establishing the status of her lien, proof she has filed her tax 
returns, or proof of any payments in the past 18 months.4 This debt has not been resolved. 
 
 In addition to her federal tax lien, Applicant has eight delinquent debts totaling 
$30,433 (SOR ¶ 1.c. through 1.j.). These debts appear in her credit reports (Items 4 and 
5).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c. CAPONEAUTO $13,289 
 
This account was for a vehicle. Applicant stopped making payments in 2011, and 
the debt was charged off in approximately 2012 (Item 4 at 2 and Item 5 at 6). Applicant 
claimed in her SCA that should would start making payments in May 2016. After 36 
payments of $105, this debt would be settled (Item 2 at 45). In her Answer, Applicant 
denied this debt and claimed that since June 2016, she had been making $102 payments 
per month, but did not provide documentary proof. In her Response to the FORM, she 
provided proof of $102.23 payments in May 2016, June 2016, and November 2017 (AX 
A at 22, 26, and 32). This debt has not been resolved. 
  
SOR ¶ 1.d. TOWER LOAN $5,115 
 
This account was for a personal loan. Applicant stopped making payments 2012, 
and the debt was charged off (Item 4 at 2). In her Answer, Applicant admitted to this debt.

This debt has been resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e. MERRICK $4,629 
 
This account was for a credit card. Applicant stopped making payments in 2012, 
and the debt was charged off. In her Answer, Applicant admitted to this debt, and it has 
not paid (AX A at 1). This debt has not been resolved.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f. CAP ONE $3,718 
 
Applicant stopped making payments for this account in 2012, and the debt was 
charged off. Applicant disclosed this debt in her SCA, and indicated that in May 2016 
                                                          
4  Applicant has asserted she is not required to make payments to the IRS while she is working in a combat 
zone. She included in her Response to the FORM an IRS Notice 1052. The notice was revised in April 
2003, but it is undated as to when it was sent to Applicant. Additionally, it is no longer available on the IRS 
website.

In her Answer, Applicant denied this debt and claimed it was paid in July 2016. 
She made three payments of $532.92 and claims she settled the debt for $1,598.76. She 
provided documentation of the payments in May June, and July 2016, but did not provide

Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”5 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”6 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”7

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”8 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.9 “Substantial evidence” is “more than 
a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”10 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an 
applicant’s security suitability.11 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.12 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.13

  An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”14 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”15 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
 The concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.16  
 
 Applicant’s admissions and her credit reports establish three disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”), AG ¶ 19(c) (“a 
history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently 
filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax as required”). 
 
 AG ¶ 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two are 
potentially applicable in this case: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 
 
                                                          
14 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). 
 
15 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
16 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 7
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
I considered that Applicant is not required to be debt-free in order to qualify for a 
security clearance.17 However, Applicant has a significant outstanding IRS tax lien and 
several other unpaid debts. Applicant went through a divorce and periods of 
unemployment; however, she did not meet her burden to establish that she acted 
responsibly to address her unpaid debts in a timely manner. Her bankruptcy indicates she 
has a lengthy history of financial issues, which continues to the present day. AG ¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b) are not established.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG 
¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns at issue. 
Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security of the United States to grant her eligibility for access 
to classified information. 
 
                                                          
17 ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in 
order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given 
his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct” 
that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan).

Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraphs 1.a.-1.c.:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.d.:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.e.-1.g.:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.h.-1.j.:  For Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of 
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
