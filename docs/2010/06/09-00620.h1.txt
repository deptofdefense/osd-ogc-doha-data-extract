Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence
shows Applicant has a history of financial problems, to include defaulted student loans
that are now in collection. There is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or
mitigate the security concerns stemming from his history of financial problems.
Accordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 9,1
2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a
complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline
known as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the
case be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke
Applicant’s security clearance.  
Applicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me November 24, 2009. The hearing took place February 3,
2010. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received February 12, 2010. 
The record was kept open until March 1, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner, and those matters are
admitted without objections.   2
Findings of Fact
Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 27-year-old college graduate who is seeking an industrial security
clearance for the first time. He is doing so in light of a job offer as a university research
analyst; the job offer is contingent upon him obtaining a security clearance. Applicant is
currently unemployed and has been so since September 2009, when he was laid off
from his job with an electronics company. He receives about $900 to $1,000 monthly in
unemployment compensation, and he is currently in a negative cash flow situation.  He3
is unmarried and the father of one child for whom he voluntarily pays child support when
he can afford to do so.

Applicant has a history of financial problems.  He traces his financial problems to4
the 2005–2006 period when he injured his back while at work.  As a result, he was5
unable to work from about December 2005 to April 2006.  He had a temporary total6
disability and received $84 every two weeks in workers’ compensation. He used credit
cards to pay for his living expenses and fell behind on his bills. 
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent or past-due debts with various creditors. In his
answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the debts, but contends that the accounts in SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, and 1.m are the same. In general, he explained that he was unemployed
and unable to make steady payments, but would do so if he had the means. The debts
include six student loans alleged to be past due for various amounts. The student loans
will be discussed together, and the current status of the other debts is discussed below. 
SOR ¶ 1.a concerns a collection account with a balance of $8,049. Applicant
received a settlement offer in August 2008, but could not afford to accept it.  He has7
since made two $10 payments. 
SOR ¶ 1.b concerns a collection account with a balance of $787. Applicant
received a settlement officer in January 2008, but could not afford to accept it.  He has8
since made two $10 payments. 
SOR ¶ 1.c concerns a medical collection account with a balance of $248.
Applicant reduced the balance to $238 as of October 2009.  He has since made two9
$10 payments.10
SOR ¶ 1.d concerns a judgment against Applicant in the amount of $5,196. It
concerns the same creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a, but appears to concern a different account. In
June 2009, the balance due was $5,174, and Applicant agreed to satisfy the account by
paying $25 monthly.  Since then, he made a $25 payment in July 2009, and two $1011
payments in February 2010.12

SOR ¶ 1.e concerns a collection account with a balance of $3,522. Applicant
presented account statements showing a balance of $3,645 as of November 2009, and
a balance of $3,712 as of February 2010.  13
SOR ¶¶ 1.f–1.k concern the six student loan accounts, all of which have past-due
balances. Applicant presented incomplete information on these loans, but it appears
that these loans are now in default and in collection.  Previously, SallieMae agreed to14
put the loans in forbearance from late December 2007 to late July 2008.  Then in July15
2009, Applicant applied for an economic hardship deferment and obtained preapproval
of his request.  By November 2009, the loans had been turned over to a collection16
agency seeking a lump-sum payment of 50% of the total principal and interest, which
then was about $55,695.  Applicant was only able to make small payments on the17
loans, such as a $10 payment in November 2009.  More recently in February 2010, the18
loans were returned from the collection agency to SallieMae, and Applicant made a $10
payment the same month.  In addition to that payment, the last five payments to his19
account cover the period March 2008 to December 2009, for a total of about $374.  20
SOR ¶ 1.l concerns a charged-off account with a balance of $4,281. Applicant
presented no documentary information on this account. 
SOR ¶ 1.m concerns a collection account with a balance of $6,196. Applicant
presented proof of a $10 payment in February 2009, and a $10 payment in September
2009.21
 
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is
to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to22
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to ath
security clearance).

It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As22
noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,23
any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified
information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An24
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  25
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting26
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An27
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate28
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme29
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31
The Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.32
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 33

and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-
person concept. 
A person granted access to classified information enters into a special
relationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree
of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified
information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination
of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the32
strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant33
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security
concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under
Guideline F is that: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  34
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information.   
The record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within35 36
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions.   
 AG ¶ 20 (a) – (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). 37
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1) – (9).38

Under Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:37
(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts;
(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d) based on Applicant’s
periods of unemployment and his efforts to pay, although minimal, within his means. But
the credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security concerns. Applicant is
facing a mountain of debt, to include defaulted student loans that are now in collection.
His prospects for making a realistic good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his
indebtedness are not good. Looking forward, it is too soon to rule out the likelihood of
additional financial problems. What is missing here is a well-established track record of
repayment. Although I am persuaded Applicant is sincere and genuinely wants to take
care of his delinquent debts, his track record at this point is insufficient to make any safe
predictive judgments about the future.   
To conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant’s ongoing
financial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence.38

Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a
favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.m: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
