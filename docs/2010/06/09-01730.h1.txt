Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence
shows Applicant has a history of financial problems, to include state and federal tax
debts. There is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security
concerns stemming from his history of financial problems. Accordingly, as explained in
further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   
 Exhibits G–M.2

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 15,1
2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a
complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline
known as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the
case be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke
Applicant’s security clearance.  
Applicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me December 3, 2009. The hearing took place February 3, 2010.
The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received February 12, 2010. 
The record was kept open until March 1, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner, and those matters are
admitted without objections.   2
Findings of Fact
Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance, although he held one in the past. He is twice married,
divorced once, and separated from his current wife since 2005. He is the father of five
children, all adults, the youngest of whom is 18 years old. 
Applicant’s employment history includes working as a field service representative
for another federal contractor from 1996 to December 2005, when he decided to quit
that job. This was approximately the same time (2005) when he and his wife separated.
He was unemployed from December 2005 to June 2007. He worked as a maintenance
technician from June 2007 to May 2008, when he was fired due to a disagreement with
another employee. He was then unemployed until October 2008, when he began his

current employment as a field service representative, and has been working full-time in
this position since April 2009. His annual salary is about $52,000.  3
After Applicant quit his job in 2005 and separated from his wife, he became
depressed to the point that he was hospitalized. This took place when Applicant did not
have health insurance. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute, for more
than ten years.  His history includes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 1999, state and4
federal tax debts, and delinquent consumer debts. 
His tax debts were caused by an early withdrawal from a retirement account
when he cashed out a 401(k) account. He used the proceeds for his living expenses
when he was unemployed.  
As of June 2009, he owed the IRS $5,348 for tax year 2006 and $3,627 for tax
year 2007.  He has an installment agreement with the IRS under which he is making5
monthly payments. He presented documentary proof of nine monthly payments to the
IRS in 2009.   6
As of January 2010, he owed the state a total of $3,538 broken down as follows:
$1,940 for tax year 2006, $641 for tax year 2007, and $956 for tax year 2008.  The state7
has obtained judgments against Applicant for tax years 2007 and 2008.  
In addition to the bankruptcy and tax debts, the SOR alleges eight delinquent
debts with various creditors. The table below summarizes the current status of those
eight debts.

Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is
to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As8
noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,9
any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified
information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An10
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  11
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting12
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An13

applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate14
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme15
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.16
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.17
The Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant
and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-
person concept. 
A person granted access to classified information enters into a special
relationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree
of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified
information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination
of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the18
strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant19
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security
concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under
Guideline F is that: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  20
 AG ¶ 19(a).  21

Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information.   
The record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within21 22
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions.   
Under Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:23
(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts;
(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d) based on Applicant’s
periods of unemployment and his efforts to repay his debts within his means. But the
credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security concerns. Applicant is facing
more than $20,000 in delinquent debts, with more than $12,000 owed to state and

federal tax authorities. He has paid six of the eight consumer debts, but he has made no
progress in addressing the other two, which account for more than $8,000. Although I
am persuaded Applicant is sincere and genuinely wants to take care of his delinquent
debts, the record is insufficient to make any safe predictive judgments that Applicant will
resolve the remaining debts anytime soon. In addition, I note that the state and federal
tax debts are viewed with disfavor, and I gave those matters substantial weight in my
analysis.    
To conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant’s ongoing
financial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence.24
Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a
favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.b: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.c–1.g: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.h: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.i: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.j–1.m: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
