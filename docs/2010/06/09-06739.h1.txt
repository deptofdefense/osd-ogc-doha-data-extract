GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance or access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 20, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86).1 On a subsequent unspecified date in 2009, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of 
interrogatories pertaining primarily to his financial situation. He responded to the 
interrogatories on October 30, 2009.2 On another unspecified date in 2009, DOHA 
furnished him another set of interrogatories pertaining primarily to his financial situation.

2 Item 6 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated October 30, 2009).

He responded to those interrogatories on October 30, 2009, as well.3 On January 10, 
2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (hereinafter AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 15, 2010. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated that same day, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A 
complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on April 
1, 2010, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of 
the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  
Applicant received the FORM on April 6, 2010, and submitted a substantial number of 
documents on May 3, 2010. The case was assigned to me on May 21, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.c. of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
production planner,4 and he is seeking to retain the CONFIDENTIAL security clearance 
previously granted to him in 1999.5 He graduated from high school in June 1972,6 and 
completed extensive training in the local community college and from his employer for 
various short courses leading to the award of certificates.7 He has no military service.8 
Upon his graduation from high school, he held a variety of positions in the private 
sector, including structural welder, weld supervisor, inspection supervisor, inspection 
controller, senior logistics engineer, and senior logistician.9 Applicant was hired by his

current employer in June 1999.10 Applicant and his wife were married in 1974, and they 
had three children, twin daughters who died shortly after their birth in 1977, and a son, 
born in 1979.11  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1986, when his 
wife sustained a back injury when the scaffolding on which she was working collapsed, 
causing her to fall.12 Her employer refused to cover her medical costs or loss of income 
due to the injury, and she was forced to hire an attorney in an attempt to recoup 
damages. She was only able to recover about fifty percent of what she believed she 
was entitled.13 Applicant attributed his resulting unspecified financial problems to his 
wife’s loss of income and unexpected medical costs arising from her injury, as well as 
unexplained emergency room visits for her and himself.14 Applicant never explained 
why he was unable to pay his delinquent accounts.  
 
Because of those unspecified financial problems, in September 1986, Applicant 
and his wife filed a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code.15 An unspecified number of debts, with an unspecified total, were discharged in 
December 1986.16 Although Applicant contends he paid some of his creditors after the 
bankruptcy discharge date,17 he offered no documentary evidence to support his 
contention. 
 
Little is known about Applicant’s finances for the next 10 years. On November 
11, 1990, his family residence was engulfed by flames and destroyed. He lost two pets 
and sustained the loss of over $18,000 not covered by insurance.18 The record is silent 
as to the cause of the fire. Applicant claims he and his wife continued to have numerous 
medical problems and unidentified expenditures that were not covered by insurance. He 
spent eight days in the intensive care unit of a hospital for irregular heart beat.19 His

wife was supposedly injured in another workplace incident when something fell off an 
assembly line and injured her arm.20 He claims she underwent three surgeries for the 
injury and was on morphine patches for her chronic pain.21 Applicant offered no 
documentary evidence to support his claims about the medical problems. Because of 
his medical condition, his wife took over handling the family finances but, due to her 
continuing morphine treatment, “she made poor financial decisions.”22 It is unclear how 
her treatment affected her attentiveness and decision-making over the 10 year period, 
and Applicant offered no explanations regarding the same. Additionally, he offered no 
explanation as to what financial decisions were made poorly by her or why those 
decisions were considered poorly made. Applicant never explained how his accounts 
became delinquent or why he was unable to pay them.  
 
Because of those unspecified financial problems, in May 1996, Applicant and his 
wife again filed a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code.23 An unspecified number of debts, totaling approximately $122,186, were 
discharged on September 5, 1996.24 Applicant contends he received “counseling for the 
problem,”25 but he never explained what type of counseling he received, who furnished 
it, or what the problem was. 
 
On January 13, 1997, his family residence was engulfed by flames and 
destroyed. He lost one pet and sustained the loss of between $12,00026 and over 
$15,000 not covered by insurance.27 The record is silent as to the cause of the fire. He 
claims his son has liver disease and almost died on two occasions.28 His son is 
unemployed and has generated over $500,000 in medical expenses,29 but there is no 
evidence that those expenses are Applicant’s responsibility. Applicant’s wife lost her job 
due to a lack of work in 2008, and was out of work until about the beginning of 2009.30 
In about 2004, it was discovered that Applicant has diabetes and unspecified knee

problems.31 He estimates he incurs about $3,250 per year on medications and copays 
for his conditions.32  
 
In February 2009, Applicant and his wife filed a joint petition for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.33 According to the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy 
Trustee six month report, as of October 1, 2009, Applicant had paid the Trustee 
$4,516.14.34 According to his bankruptcy plan, Applicant is obligated to pay a minimum 
“base” amount of $42,600.35 As of October 1, 2009, his remaining base was 
$38,083.86.36 Applicant listed numerous creditors in his bankruptcy plan, including 
vendors, medical providers, collection agencies, banks, credit unions, insurance 
agencies, finance companies, a state and a municipality, and the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS).37 A November 2009 Equifax credit report lists medical accounts, lines of 
credit, retail stores, mortgage, and auto accounts that had been placed for collection or 
charged off.38 Applicant never explained how his accounts became delinquent or why 
he was unable to pay them.  
 
In order to make his payments under the bankruptcy plan, $327.69 is supposed 
to be garnished per pay period from his salary.39 Those payments, from May 20, 2009 
through September 23, 2009, were irregular, with six payments of $327.69, one 
payment of $730, one payment of $710, one payment of $250, one payment of $100, 
and one payment of $50.40 He offered no explanation for the irregular amounts. 
Applicant has furnished no current evidence, such as a newer Chapter 13 Bankruptcy 
Trustee six month report or Direct Deposit Advice Slip, to corroborate his payment 
claims. Also, Applicant contends he received “counseling for the problem,”41 but once 
again, he failed to explain what type of counseling he received, who furnished it, or what 
the problem was.

monthly net income of $3,908.22, monthly expenses of $2,677, monthly debt payments 
of $2,168.34, and a net remainder of minus $937.12. There are no funds available for

Character References 
 
The company vice president and operations manager, as well as different 
program and production managers, have frequently praised Applicant’s efforts, 
outstanding performance, and sacrifices, in meeting various deadlines under extreme 
pressure. He has received certificates, letters, and e-mails of appreciation.43 Applicant 
is an active volunteer in his community
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”44 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”45   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”46 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.47  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”48 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”49 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until about 1986. His inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts led to a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of an unspecified amount of delinquent debt in 
December 1986. Ten years later, because of continuing family health problems and his 
continued inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts, he again filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, and in September 1996, $122,186 of delinquent debt was discharged. In 
February 2009, faced with continuing delinquent debt, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@50  
50 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
 
9 
                                      
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
 
Applicant=s financial situation started to deteriorate in 1986, when his wife 
sustained a workplace injury. Subsequent events, including health issues for Applicant 
and his wife and adult son, and the loss of two residences to fires, purportedly resulted 
in unspecified financial problems. Despite having his unsecured delinquent debts 
discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on two occasions, in 
December 1986 and September 1996, in February 2009, Applicant and his wife again 
filed for bankruptcy, this time under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.   
 
For unspecified reasons, he continued to accumulate substantial delinquent debt. 
As noted above, Applicant never explained how his accounts became delinquent over a 
period of 24 years, or why he was unable to pay them. He offered no evidence to 
support his claims about the various medical problems or how they negatively impacted 
his finances. While he attributed some of his financial problems to his wife making poor 
financial decisions, it remains unclear how her medical treatment affected her 
attentiveness and decision-making over a 10 year period. He offered no explanation as 
to what financial decisions were made poorly by her or why those decisions were 
considered poorly made. Such evidence is critical to an analysis as to whether or not 
the circumstances vaguely described might recur. Likewise, it is difficult to assess 
Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, without such evidence. 
Simply claiming family medical problems and residence fires caused him to incur 
delinquent debts, without specific evidence of how they did so, is insufficient. The 
evidence fails to establish AG ¶ 20(a).  
 
Applicant’s continuing delinquent debts, even after two Chapter 7 discharges, 
constitute “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence.51 
There was apparently a temporary loss of employment by his wife in 1986, and 
unexpected medical emergencies for both his wife and himself in the past. But Applicant 
has not indicated how those circumstances impacted his finances in the past or how 
they continue to impact his current finances. Without such evidence, it is difficult to 
assess Applicant’s actions under those unspecified circumstances as responsible or 
irresponsible. AG ¶ 20(b), only partially applies because his financial situation may have 
been initially caused by the factors he summarily described, but there is little evidence 
that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances.52  
 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

While there is some unsubstantiated evidence to indicate Applicant received 
“counseling,” he never explained what type of counseling he received, who furnished it, 
or what the problem was. I cannot speculate as to the nature of the counseling and 
whether or not it included debt management, debt consolidation, payment plans, 
budgeting, or bankruptcy guidance. The evidence fails to establish AG ¶ 20(c). 
 
Applicant claimed he paid some of his creditors after each of his two earlier 
discharges in bankruptcy in 1986 and 1996, yet he offered no evidence of same. It 
appears that under the guidance of the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Trustee, he has 
established a plan for eventually repaying overdue creditors. There is evidence that 
during the initial six months of his plan he paid the Trustee $4,516.14. There is no 
evidence of continuing payments. Applicant’s net monthly remainder was minus 
$937.12. Thus, there were no funds available for discretionary spending as of October 
2009. It is not clear if the net monthly remainder has yet reached the positive level. The 
evidence only partially establishes AG ¶ 20(d). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When his 
financial problems first began, Applicant’s wife had been injured in a workplace incident. 
Eventually, there were family health issues and two devastating house fires. Applicant 
failed to explain how those circumstances negatively impacted his finances and caused 
his accounts to become delinquent, or how he responded to his financial difficulties. It is 
unclear if Applicant ignored his creditors or attempted to deal with his financial 
delinquencies. In 1986 and 1996, his financial problems were eliminated when his 
delinquencies were discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. But the financial

delinquencies continued, and as of February 2009, his delinquent accounts are being 
handled under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the family health issues and residence fires were circumstances beyond his 
control, Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a wide variety of 
creditors, but he either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he 
continued to accumulate extensive delinquent debt, even after benefiting from 
bankruptcy discharges of his debts. Applicant has been gainfully employed since 1972, 
and with his current employer since 1999. Nevertheless, except for his Chapter 13 
repayment plan, established in February 2009, there is no evidence that he made any 
good-faith efforts to pay a variety of delinquent debts. There is no evidence that he 
made any prior efforts to arrange repayment plans, and it is unclear if he preferred to 
wait and consider other options. (See AG & 2(a)(1) through AG & 2(a)(9).) While his 
current delinquent debts may eventually be paid off, his earlier failures to repay 
creditors in a more timely manner, or even make efforts to arrange payment plans, 
reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.  
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least 
under repayment arrangements; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns 
about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, 
considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.53 The absence of any reasonable 
good-faith efforts, other than his Chapter 13 efforts, or little evidence to reflect actual 
payments, are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:54 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
53 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
