CURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is
granted.
Statement of the Case
On June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline
F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the
adjudicative guidelines (AG).
Applicant answered the SOR on August 17, 2009, denying all of the allegations
except SOR subparagraph 1.a. He requested a hearing, and the case was assigned to
Applicant’s rent tripled. (Tr. 44)1

another administrative judge on September 24, 2009. DOHA originally scheduled the
hearing for December 11, 2009. It was continued and the case was reassigned to me.
On January 13, 2010, a notice of hearing was issued rescheduling the hearing for
February 2, 2010. The hearing was conducted as rescheduled. I received 11
Government exhibits, 15 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant’s testimony. I left the record
open at the conclusion of the hearing, at Applicant’s request, to allow him to submit
additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted 11 additional exhibits that I
marked and received as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) P through Z. The transcript was
received on February 12, 2010.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 44-year-old married man with one child, age 20. After graduating
from high school in 1983, Applicant joined the U.S. Marine Corps where he served for
the next 13 years. He was honorably discharged. While in the Marines, he earned
several medals and citations including the Meritorious Unit Citation and the Good
Conduct Medal. (Tr. 17)
Since leaving the Marines in 1997, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor
as a systems engineer. (Tr. 17) Specifically, he assists with flight control services for an
aircraft system.
Applicant is highly respected on the job and in the community. According to a
coworker, he is “dedicated to the task, insightful, industrious, and committed to doing
the job right.” (AE Q) A longtime friend with whom Applicant served in the Marines
characterizes him as “one of the most hard working, dedicated, and honest people that
[he] know[s].” (AE P)
At or about the time Applicant was transitioning from the Marine Corps, his wife
was struggling with multiple physical and emotional problems stemming from five failed
pregnancies. (GE 1 at 2) She subsequently was diagnosed with clinical depression.
During this period, she became increasingly unable to maintain a steady job. Because
Applicant was dependent on both incomes to maintain the family finances, their debts
grew delinquent. (Id.)
By 2002, Applicant had accrued a $5,000 federal income tax delinquency for tax
years 1993, and 1995 through 1997, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m. In 2002,
Applicant’s car was repossessed, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.l. (Tr. 45)
In 2003, Applicant relocated to another state. The cost of living in the state where
they relocated was much higher than that of the state from where they had moved. (Tr.
45)  Also, Applicant’s wife was unable to obtain full-time, steady employment after they1
moved.
3
In May 2003, the IRS obtained a lien against Applicant’s property and garnished
his wages. (AE 2 at 2) By early 2006, Applicant had satisfied the IRS delinquency
through a combination of payments through the garnishment and the application of tax
refunds to the delinquency from subsequent tax years. (AE Z at 2, 5 - 6, 16, and 19) 
Approximately $14,000 of debt, however, remained delinquent. In 2008,
Applicant’s wife’s grandmother died. After probate, they inherited $71,330, which they
received in July 2009. (AE A) The following month, Applicant began satisfying his
delinquencies, as follows:

r. $189.00 cable tv - exact date unknown AE V.
t. $50.00 medical bill - 8/14/09 AE D at 2.
Applicant disputes the delinquencies listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.s and 1.u,
medical bills collectively totaling $132. Applicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR
subparagraph 1.s. It could not locate any record confirming that he owed this debt. (Tr.
Applicant’s wife spent the remainder of her inheritance on attorney fees related to a lawsuit against her2
stepmother involving the right to visit her father, an invalid. (Tr. 35) 
4
28) I find that this debt is not his responsibility. Applicant successfully disputed the debt
listed in SOR subparagraph 1.u, and it was removed from his credit report. (AE N)
The delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a, in the amount of $8,018, is the
deficiency remaining from a repossessed car in 2005. (Tr. 46) Approximately 18 months
ago, the creditor offered to close the account in exchange for a $2,500 lump-sum
payment. (Tr. 37) Applicant could not then afford it. After receiving the inheritance,
Applicant contacted the creditor to attempt to settle the account consistent with the
original offer. The creditor, however, had withdrawn the offer. Currently, they are
negotiating a settlement. Applicant prefers to pay the total over a 120-month period,
whereas, the creditor wants a lump-sum payment. 
Applicant and his wife have spent all of the money received through the
inheritance.  (Tr. 35) Applicant has $5,100 in savings and $7,000 in a 401k account. (Tr.2
34). If he cannot negotiate an agreement with the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph
1.a, he will satisfy it entirely using money from his savings or by borrowing money from
his 401k account. (Tr. 36) 
Applicant maintains a budget. (Tr. 47) He earns $83,000 annually. (Tr. 34)
Although Applicant’s wife’s income has remained sporadic over the years, they are no
longer dependent on her income to make ends meet. (Tr. 48)
Applicant has not attended financial counseling. (Tr. 49) However, both he and
his wife have read books on money management. Also, both “understand where the
money’s going and what [they] have to spend.” (Tr. 49)
Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.
5
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .” The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security
decision.
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Under this guideline, “failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts,
and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about
an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG
¶ 18). Applicant’s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG ¶¶ 19(a),
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial
obligations.”
The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts; and
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by extravagant spending.
Instead, they were caused by the difficulties his wife had in maintaining steady
employment. Because they were dependent on both incomes to make ends meet, they
were unable to maintain financial solvency when she was not working.
6
Since Applicant’s wife received her inheritance, they have either satisfied or
successfully disputed all of their delinquent debts except for one, an automobile
deficiency, which they are attempting to settle in good faith. 
Before Applicant’s wife received the inheritance, he had done little to address his
financial delinquencies. Although his wife’s struggles maintaining steady employment
exacerbated his financial difficulties, they do not entirely outweigh the negative security
inference created by having two cars repossessed within five years.
Nevertheless, the receipt of the inheritance has enabled Applicant to pay nearly
all of his delinquencies and reorganize the family finances such that he can manage
them with his income solely. Also, the savings he has accrued over the last two years
minimize the possibility of recurrence, and enhance the credibility of his assertion that
he will satisfy the last outstanding debt. I conclude that all of the mitigating conditions,
as listed above, apply.
Whole-Person Concept
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
I evaluated the whole-person factors when I addressed the applicability of the
mitigating conditions. I conclude Applicant has rehabilitated his financial situation. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.u: For Applicant

Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
