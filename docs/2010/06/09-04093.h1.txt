Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire (e-QIP) on February 9, 
2009. On November 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) which became effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On December 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 
5, 2010. The case was assigned to me on February 19, 2010. On March 11, 2010, a 
Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for April 20, 2010. The case was 
heard on that date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as 
Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 5. The Applicant testified and offered four exhibits which 
were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The record was held open until May 4, 
2010, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. On April 7, 2010, I granted 
 
 
 
 
2
Applicant’s request for an extension until April 23, 2010, to submit documents. No 
additional documents were submitted. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 27, 
2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, 
eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a – 1.d,  and 1.f -
1.h. She denies SOR allegations 1.e and 1.i.   
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old corporate recruiter employed with a Department of 
Defense contractor.  She has worked for her current employer for two years. This is her 
first time applying for a Department of Defense security clearance. She has a Masters in 
Business Administration. She is single. She has one adult daughter, age 33, and an 
adopted nephew. Her nephew currently lives with his mother. (Tr. 6-7, 18-19; Gov 1.)  
 
Applicant’s security clearance background investigation revealed that she has 
the following delinquent accounts: a $1,345 medical account placed for collection in     
August 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 2 at 9, 49; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 10); a $1,306 
clothing store account placed for collection in February 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 8, 
47, 52; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 9); a $931 furniture store account placed for 
collection in February 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 2 at 6, 46, 53; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 
5 at 4 - 5);  a $9,137 credit card account placed for collection in December 2007 (SOR ¶ 
1.d: Gov 2 at 7, 44; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4-5); a $283 telephone account placed for 
collection in May 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 12, 49, 59; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 
14); a $2,592 credit card account placed for collection in October 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 
2 at 43; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 5, 11, 15); a $5,382 credit card account placed for 
collection in June 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 2 at 44, 52; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $1,810 
bank account charged off in May 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 2 at 9, 46; Gov 5 at 1,14; AE 
A); and a $189 account placed for collection in May 2009. (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 2 at 47) 
 
From September 1993 to July 2006, Applicant worked for the family construction 
business. She earned approximately $60,000 annually. The business slowed and 
several employees were laid off including Applicant. From July 2006, to December 
2006, she was self-employed as an insurance agent. She earned very little income in 
this job. For this reason, from September 2006 to February 2007, she was virtually 
unemployed. Between February 2007 and May 2007, she worked several temporary 
positions where she was paid $20 an hour. From May 2007 to July 2008, Applicant 
worked as a recruiter for another company. She earned an annual salary of $60,000.  
She began work for her current employer in July 2008. Her starting salary was $65,000. 
She currently earns $73,300. (Tr. 47-52; Gov 1; Gov 2) 
 
When she was laid off in 2006, Applicant was unable to pay all of her bills. 
Several accounts became delinquent. She is now in a position where she can begin to 
resolve some of her accounts. (Tr. 12-13; Answer to SOR) On February 17, 2009, 
Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt repayment company. She agreed to 
 
 
 
 
3
pay them $550 a month. The company would negotiate settlements with her creditors. 
Applicant made monthly payments until July 2009. She decided that she could do a 
better job of negotiating settlements with her creditors on her own. She hopes to get the 
$2,750 that she paid to the company refunded because they did not resolve any of her 
accounts. (Tr. 23-26; Gov 2 at 16-24) 
 
Applicant has had several settlement offers from her creditors. The creditors all 
want lump sum payments which she cannot afford. She has not resolved any of the 
accounts listed in the SOR. On April 1, 2010, the creditor who is collecting on the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d offered to settle the $9,173 debt for $4,585. (AE D) On April 2, 
2010, she received a settlement offer to settle the $2,592 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f for 
$895. (AE C) On April 2, 2010, she received an offer to settle the $5,382 debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.g for $1,843. (AE B)  
 
Applicant denies the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.i. She claims that she did 
not have a telephone account with the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. She disputed the 
account online but provided no proof of the dispute. She denies the debt alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.i because she does not recognize it. (Tr. 33-35; 45-46)  
 
Applicant’s net monthly income is $4,285. Her regular monthly expenses include: 
first mortgage payment $1,644; second mortgage payment $562; groceries $200; 
utilities $595, medical co-payments $50; car payment $432; car expenses $179; credit 
card payment $25; hair $75. Her monthly expenses total approximately $3,762. She has 
$523 left over each month after her regular monthly expenses. (Tr. 55-63; Gov 2 at 67) 
Applicant’s first mortgage payment used to be $2,468. She recently modified the 
mortgage payment so it was reduced to $1,644. She is current on federal and state 
income tax obligations. She has approximately $10,000 in a 401(k) retirement account. 
(Tr. 58, 63, 73) 
 
Applicant now has a better grasp on her monthly expenses. She has not 
attended financial counseling. (Tr. 69-71)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to 
brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered 
when evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
 
 
 
 
4
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 
 
 
 
5
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG 
&19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. 
Applicant has had financial difficulties for the past several years. The SOR alleged nine 
delinquent accounts, a total approximate balance of $23,065.  
 
The government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005))  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. AG ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long 
ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment) partially applies. Applicant got into financial trouble after she was laid off in 
2006 and underwent a period of unemployment and lower paying jobs. However, she 
has not resolved any of her delinquent accounts even though she has matched her 
previous income of $60,000 a year since May 2007. For this reason, this mitigating 
condition is given less weight. Applicant’s unresolved debts raise questions about her 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
 AG & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant was unemployed 
for five months from the fall 2006 to the spring 2007. A period of unemployment and 
underemployment resulted in several delinquent accounts. For AG ¶ 20 to fully apply, it 
must be found Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. I cannot conclude 
Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances because she has been gainfully 
employed since May 2007 and has not resolved any of her delinquent accounts. She 
started to resolve her delinquent accounts in February 2009 when she entered into the 
debt repayment program. However, she stopped making payments in July 2009 
because she thought she could do a better job on her own. She never followed through 
with making any payments towards her delinquent accounts. While circumstances 
beyond her control contributed to Applicant’s financial problems, she has not acted 
responsibly with regard to resolving her delinquent accounts.   
 
AG ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) 
does not apply. Applicant did not attend financial counseling. At the close of the record, 
none of the delinquent accounts were resolved. 
 
 
 
 
 
6
AG & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant has made several initial 
attempts to resolve her delinquent accounts, she has never followed through with 
paying her delinquent accounts. All of the debts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved.  
 
Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s period of 
unemployment and underemployment between July 2006 to May 2007. While Applicant 
made initial attempts to resolve her delinquent accounts, she never followed through 
with her intentions to resolve any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. None 
of the delinquent accounts are resolved. While there were mitigating circumstances in 
this case, they do not outweigh the concerns raised due to Applicant’s lack of effort 
towards resolving her delinquent accounts. She has been gainfully employed since May 
2007, but has not resolved any of her delinquent accounts. I find Applicant did not meet 
her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.   
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a – 1.i:   Against Applicant 
 
 
 
 
7
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
