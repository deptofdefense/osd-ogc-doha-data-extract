GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 6, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing version of a Security Clearance 
Application (e-QIP).1 On a subsequent unspecified date in 2008, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his 
financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories on December 6, 2008.2 On June 
4, 2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP), dated June 6, 2007. For reasons unexplained, Applicant recertified that his 
answers were true on March 30, 2009.

Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access 
to Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 16, 2009. In a sworn, written 
statement, dated July 13, 209, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on September 4, 2009, and the case was 
assigned to Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch on September 10, 2009. A notice of 
Hearing was issued on November 10, 2009, scheduling the hearing for December 10, 
2009. Due to a family emergency, the hearing was cancelled on December 3, 2009. On 
December 15, 2009, it was reassigned to Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry due to 
caseload considerations, and on January 11, 2010, it was reassigned to Administrative 
Judge Edward W. Loughran, again due to caseload considerations. On February 12, 
2010, it was again reassigned, this time to me. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
March 12, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 31, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, nine Government exhibits and seven Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant and one other witness testified. The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on April 8, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.j.) of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
an avionics technician IV,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He had 
previously held a security clearance during 1996 – 2006, while assigned to the state Air 
National Guard (ANG).4 Following graduation from high school, for varying periods, he 
attended a local community college, a state university, and an aeronautical college, 
before receiving his associate degree in applied science in avionics from another 
community college in 2000.5

From 1990 until 1995, while attending classes, Applicant also held a part-time job 
with a local company where he was eventually promoted to the position of shipping 
manager.6 In April 1995, Applicant left his job and enlisted in the state ANG.7 His initial 
assignments were essentially part-time, working one week every month as well as a two 
week period every year,8 but in June 1997, he was able to secure a full-time position as 
an electronic warfare technician.9 He subsequently applied for a position in the pilot 
training program, and in September 2001, was commissioned as a second lieutenant.10 
As a commissioned officer, he was no longer eligible to hold his full-time enlisted 
position, and he was required to resign from it.11 During the period September 2001 
until February 2006, Applicant chose not to seek other permanent employment because 
he hoped to obtain a permanent position with the ANG and believed a permanent 
position elsewhere would interfere with his eligibility.12 Applicant attempted to complete 
his pilot training requirements, but in the post “9/11” environment was unable to do so.13 
He was denied the opportunity to continue with another class because he had already 
reached the mandatory age ceiling.14 Although he was promoted to first lieutenant, he 
was informed that, without his bachelor’s degree, he was ineligible for further ANG 
promotions, and in February 2006, was released from active duty.15 Several months 
before his release from the ANG, Applicant returned to his original employer, working in 
inventory control.16 Applicant was hired by his current employer in April 2007.17  
 
Applicant was married in April 2000, and he and his wife have four sons.18 He 
also has one stepson.19

release, but that document does not support his contention.

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about September 
2001. Prior to his commission in 2001, Applicant’s salary was $24 per hour with full 
benefits and insurance.20 From September 2001 until February 2006, his salary was 
based only on part-time work. From his return to his initial employer until April 2007, his 
salary was $10 per hour with no benefits or insurance.21 With his current employer, 
Applicant’s salary is $30 per hour with full benefits.22 At various times between 2001 
and 2007, all of the SOR accounts, as well as others, became delinquent because of 
Applicant’s inability to keep up with his monthly payments. Some of the accounts were 
placed for collection with a variety of collection agents, and some of the accounts were 
charged off. During his September 2007 OPM interview, he declared an intention to 
contact his creditors and attempt to settle his delinquent accounts.23 He repeated his 
intention during his October 2007 OPM interview,24 and again in his answer to 
interrogatories in December 2008.25  
 
The SOR identified 10 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit 
reports from 2007, 2008, 2009, or 2010, totaling approximately $18,241. Some 
accounts have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in different credit reports, in many 
instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or 
under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account 
numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances 
eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.  
 
Three of the accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.), totaling $680, were with Bank 
of America. Applicant initially admitted the allegations, but now contends all three 
accounts were actually one account that was split up and sold to different debt 
collectors, each of which added fees to their respective accounts.26 The account set 
forth in SOR ¶ 1.a. is a collection account for $257, listed in Applicant’s credit reports of 
April 2009,27 and September 2009.28 An account with the same account number or in

that amount is not listed in credit reports of July 2007,29 October 2008,30 or March 
2010.31 During his interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) in September 2007, Applicant claimed that a Bank of America 
(BOA) account in the charged off amount of $2,500, was actually for an America On-
Line (AOL) account that he had previously closed.32 In his answer to interrogatories in 
December 2008, he acknowledged the account, but contended the charges were in 
error, and he would dispute it with BOA.33 The only reference to that account is found in 
the July 2007 credit report with the note that it had been purchased by, or transferred to, 
another unidentified lender.34 During the hearing, Applicant claimed that a BOA 
representative stated that the original account was the one identified in SOR ¶ 1.c., 
discussed further below.35 The September 2009 credit report lists this account as 
unpaid,36 but the account is no longer reflected on the March 2010 credit report. The 
current status of this account remains unresolved. 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.b. is a collection account now held by NCO 
Financial Systems, Inc., for BOA, in the amount of $238, with a different BOA account 
number in Applicant’s credit reports of October 2008,37 April 2009,38 September 2009,39 
and March 2010.40 An account with that account number or in that amount is not listed 
in the July 2007 credit report. During his September 2007 interview with the OPM 
investigator, the account was not mentioned. In his December 2008 answer to 
interrogatories, Applicant indicated the account was being disputed.41 Although he has 
offered testimony as to the dispute, he has offered no documentary evidence to support 
his assertion. The most recent credit reports (September 200942 and March 2010)43 still 
list the account as unpaid.

The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.c. is a collection account now held by NCO 
Financial Systems, Inc., for BOA, in the amount of $185, with a different BOA account 
number in Applicant’s credit reports of July 2007,44 October 2008,45 April 2009,46 
September 2009,47 and March 2010.48 During his September 2007 interview with the 
OPM investigator, Applicant stated he would contact the creditor and settle the 
account.49 In his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, Applicant indicated the 
account was being disputed.50 In November 2009, he submitted an inquiry to BOA 
regarding a delinquent account, in the amount of $184.73. The creditor informed 
Applicant that the status of the account was accurate.51 On November 20, 2009, 
Applicant sent the designated payment agent a personal money order in the amount of 
$184.73.52 The account number listed on the money order differed from this as well as 
all other BOA accounts purportedly held by Applicant. The March 2010 credit report still 
lists the account as unpaid.53 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.d. is a collection account now held by NCO 
Financial Systems, Inc., for AT & T Wireless, in the amount of $992, in Applicant’s credit 
reports of July 2007,54 April 2009,55 September 2009,56 and March 2010.57 It does not 
appear in his October 2008 credit report. Applicant initially admitted the allegation. 
During his September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant 
acknowledged having had two cell phone accounts with AT & T, and stated he would 
contact the creditor and settle the account.58 In his December 2008 answer to

interrogatories, Applicant indicated the account was being disputed because the 
reception was poor and he had not used the phones.59 During the hearing, he denied 
having an AT & T Wireless account, but discussed the possibility that his wife may have 
had one.60 He claimed he spoke to NCO Financial Systems, Inc., “and they can’t prove 
that that was my AT & T Wireless.”61 Furthermore, he stated he had “never had an AT & 
T wireless account with them,”62 and has “no idea what that debt could be from.”63 
Applicant now contends the account is in dispute and his credit report reflects that 
fact.64 The March 2010 credit report does not support his contention, and still lists the 
account as unpaid.65 Applicant admits he has not made any payments on the account.66 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.e. is a mortgage account held by Midland 
Mortgage Company, with $3,000 past due on a total balance of $127,000. As of July 
2007, he was $2,052 in arrears and seriously delinquent.67 During his September 2007 
and October 2007 interviews with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged the 
delinquency and indicated he would obtain a second mortgage on his home by 
December 2007 to pay off all of his delinquencies, including the one on his first 
mortgage.68 No action was taken. In his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, 
Applicant indicated he had made arrangements to pay off the delinquency by December 
5, 2008.69 No action was taken. Finally, on December 11, 2009, Applicant and the 
creditor’s delinquency assistance center executed an FHA Partial Claim, in the amount 
of $10,818.41, including past due payments of $9,870.57 and attorney fees and costs of 
$947.84, creating a subordinate note secured by a deed of trust,70 something akin to an 
interest-free second mortgage. Nevertheless, in his hearing brief, Applicant’s attorney 
states that Applicant “has never refinanced his mortgage or taken out a home equity line 
of credit secured by the home. There are no second mortgages against the home.”71

Following execution of the FHA Partial Claim, Applicant’s next payment was due on 
January 1, 2010. Applicant contends he is making his monthly $1,183 payments and is 
current on the mortgages,72 but has offered no documentary evidence to support his 
contention. 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.f. is a collection account with a credit union on 
an unsecured personal loan73 that became delinquent and $818 was charged off.74 
During his September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant 
acknowledged having had the account but stated he had paid it off.75 That belief was 
apparently not accurate, for in his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, Applicant 
indicated he had made arrangements to settle the account for $500, and that once he 
received confirmation from the creditor, that amount would be paid and the account 
would be satisfied.76 No payment was made. Instead, “recently,” the creditor purportedly 
chose to refuse payment and, instead, decided to furnish Applicant with a Form 1099-C, 
reflecting a cancellation of debt.77 Applicant has made no payments on the account78 
and has not submitted a Form 1099-C or any other documentation to support his 
contention. 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.g. is a collection account with another credit 
union on a secured automobile loan79 that became delinquent and was sold or 
transferred to a collection agency.80 The vehicle was repossessed and $5,416 was 
charged off. During his September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant 
acknowledged having had the account but stated he was not aware that there was an 
outstanding balance.81 That belief was apparently not accurate, for in his October 2007 
interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged that he planned to pay off 
the balance from the second mortgage he anticipated obtaining.82 In his e-QIP, 
Applicant indicated the debt would be paid in July or August 2007.83 No payment was

made arrangements to settle the account for $4,000, and that amount would be paid 
and the account would be satisfied.84 No payment was made. Instead, on December 
31, 2009, the creditor furnished Applicant with a Form 1099-C, reflecting a cancellation 
of debt.85 Applicant has made no payments on the delinquent balance of the account.86 
The account is now closed. 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.h. is a collection account with Anderson 
Financial Network/Bloom (Afni), for Cingular, in the amount of $220.87 Applicant initially 
admitted the allegation, but then disputed the account, claiming he never had a 
telephone with Cingular.88 In his December 2008 answer to interrogatories, Applicant 
indicated he had been offered a settlement of the account for $126.71,89 but he chose 
to ignore the offer. On December 10, 2009, Equifax responded that they had 
researched the account and the disputed information had been verified.90 The account 
remains on his March 2010 credit report as disputed.91 At the hearing, Applicant 
claimed that he knew nothing about the account.92 There is no evidence that any 
paymen
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.i. is a collection account with CitiFinancial on an 
unsecured personal loan taken out to pay for his son’s medical and dental work.93 The 
delinquent balance was $6,970, and it was eventually charged off.94 During his 
September 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged having 
had the account and stated he had been offered a $4,389 settlement to pay it off.95 In 
his October 2007 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant acknowledged that he 
planned to pay off the balance from the second mortgage he anticipated obtaining.96

interrogatories, Applicant indicated that while he had made arrangements to settle the 
account, no payments had yet been made.97 Applicant subsequently disputed the 
account, and on December 10, 2009, Equifax responded that they had researched the 
account and the disputed information had been verified.98 During the hearing, Applicant 
contended he had made one $1,500 payment in August 2009,99 and the creditor offered 
him another settlement, this time for a payment of $2,500.100 He did not accept the offer 
for he did not have sufficient funds to make the lump sum payment.101 There is no 
evidence of payments made on this account since August 2009. 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.j. is a collection account with Medical Data 
Systems for an unspecified medical provider in the amount of $145.102 The account was 
sent to collection in July 2005.103 Applicant initially admitted the allegation, and during 
his September 2007 OPM interview, indicated he would call the creditor and settle the 
account.104 During the hearing, Applicant stated the creditor was unable to verify the 
account because they had no record of it,105 and he did not know what the account 
covered.106 There is no evidence that any payments were ever made. 
 
In December 2008, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating 
monthly net income of $3,168.18, monthly expenses of $2,774, monthly debt payments 
of $350, and a net remainder of $44.18 available for discretionary spending.107 Among 
the debts purportedly being paid were $1,179 for his mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.e), $200 for his 
automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.g.), and $150 for his son’s medical and dental charges (SOR 
¶ 1.i.). He did not list any other delinquent accounts as financial obligations. He listed 
$1,500 in savings and $9,200 in stocks or bonds. Applicant’s financial picture has 
improved since December 2008. He now has a monthly net income of over $3,300.108

a 401(k) worth about $10,000 and a checking account with $1,000.110 
 
Applicant intends to review his credit report and examine each delinquent debt 
with the creditors and to require justification before assuming responsibility for those 
debts. Once satisfied, he states he will either pay the debt or work out payment 
arrangements.111 
 
Despite his financial delinquencies, Applicant’s performance has apparently not 
suffered. His most recent performance evaluation, issued in April 2010, reflects an 
individual whose overall performance is rated between “exceeds standard” (the highest 
rating possible) and “at standard” (the middle rating).112  He received a merit salary 
increase.113 The site field engineer lead, an employee of the prime contractor for whom 
Applicant’s employer is a subcontractor, has known Applicant for just under three years 
and characterizes him as “the best guy that’s worked for me all my time in the military 
and within the company.”114 With his promotion out of the area, he has recommended 
that Applicant be promoted to assume his soon115 to be vacant position. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”116 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”117   
 
109 Id. at 93-96. Applicant’s estimates are: mortgage - $1,800; gasoline – $200 to $400; automobile 
insurance: $52; cell phone - $200; cable - $100; utilities - $150 to $200; trash - $30; food - $800 to $850.

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”118 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.119  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”120 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”121 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
118 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until about September 2001. He had a permanent position, was making a good 
income, and was living within his means. However, following a childhood dream of 
becoming a member of the ANG and a pilot, he chose to accept a part-time position in 
the hopes of achieving his dream. His hopes were dashed. Nevertheless, still clinging to 
the possibility of success, he intentionally ignored other non-ANG permanent job 
possibilities until April 2007. His salary plunged from $24 per hour to $10 per hour until 
his decision to join the permanent work force once again, where he now makes over 
$30 per hour. With part-time employment came reduced income, and he tried to keep 
his bills current but was unable to do so. Bills became delinquent and either went to 
collection or were charged off.  
 
Applicant repeatedly declared his intentions to contact his creditors and either 
pay off the debts or work out payment arrangements. He did so in September 2007, 
October 2007, December 2008, July 2009, and at the hearing in March 2010. At times 
he claimed he had already paid off several creditors. Those claims were subsequently 
determined to be false. Although he admitted all of his delinquent SOR debts, he chose 
to dispute several of them and claimed he had no memory of others. Of the 10 SOR 
identified delinquencies, he submitted documentary evidence of one debt payment, 
allegedly for one of the SOR debts, one modification of a mortgage, and the 
cancellation of one debt. Despite claiming he had made payments on several of the 
 
14 
                                      
 
                                                          
remaining debts, Applicant has offered no documentary evidence to support his claims. 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@122 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced when he accepted a commission in 
the ANG in September 2001, and was required to relinquish his full-time job. His 
inability to complete pilot training before reaching his mandatory age ceiling only 
exacerbated an already difficult situation. Those factors, which were initially beyond his 
control, occurred long ago and are unlikely to recur. However, his actions during the 
period September 2001 until February 2006, when he intentionally chose not to seek 
other permanent employment, do cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment. Rather than seeking full-time employment elsewhere, and attempting to 
keep his finances current, he held out for the remote possibility of being permitted to 
rejoin the ANG, and when the delinquencies increased, he ignored them. Applicant 
failed to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.123 Applicant’s 
conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(b). 
122 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case 
No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
123 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside 
his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
 
15 
                                      
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
 
Applicant did not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. Instead, he repeatedly declared his intentions to contact his creditors and either 
pay off the debts or work out payment arrangements. At times he claimed he had 
already paid off several creditors. Those claims were subsequently determined to be 
false. Although he admitted all of his delinquent SOR debts, he chose to dispute several 
of them and claimed he had no memory of others. The evidence fails to reflect any 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of any of his debts. To the contrary, of the 
disputed debts for which Applicant has furnished documentary evidence related to the 
disputes, the credit reporting agency has, upon reexamination, verified the validity of the 
debts. Of the 10 SOR identified delinquencies, he submitted documentary evidence of 
one debt payment, allegedly for one of the SOR debts, one modification of a mortgage, 
and the cancellation of one debt. Despite claiming he had made payments on several of 
the remaining debts, or had another one cancelled, Applicant has offered no 
documentary evidence to support his claims. His revised versions of facts pertaining to 
the debts themselves, or his actions regarding actual or promised payments, reflect 
poorly on his reliability and judgment.  
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts were “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence.124 Applicant receives very little credit under AG ¶ 20(d) 
because while he initially showed some good faith in his promised efforts to resolve his 
SOR debts, he ultimately abandoned even those efforts, with three possible exceptions. 
With the exception of the debts in SOR ¶ 1.e., and possibly SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.i., he 
failed to establish any type of repayment plan, much less a reasonable one, with any of 
his creditors, even the smallest ones when he could have done so. Instead, he delayed 
and disputed. Moreover, since 2007, he has done nothing to address the satisfaction of 
most of his delinquent debts.125 AG ¶ 20(d) has very limited application. AG ¶¶ 20(c) 
and 20(e) do not apply. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
 
124 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 16, 2002)). 
 
125 The Appeal Board has previously held that “[A] applicant must do more than merely show that he or she 
relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim” he or she initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). 
 
16 
                                      
 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When these 
problems first began, Applicant was following a childhood dream of becoming a member 
of the ANG and a pilot, and he chose to accept a part-time position in the hopes of 
achieving his dream. His hopes were dashed. With reduced income from a part-time job 
he was unable to generate enough money to pay his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he 
told OPM and DOHA that he was initiating efforts to contact his creditors and setting up 
payment arrangements, as well as disputing some debts that he believed were not his 
responsibility.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the part-time employment and reduced salary were initially circumstances beyond 
his control, Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a wide variety of 
creditors, but either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued 
to accumulate delinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. During the period 
September 2001 until February 2006, Applicant chose not to seek other permanent 
employment because he hoped to obtain a permanent position with the ANG and 
believed a permanent position elsewhere would interfere with his eligibility. Applicant 
has been gainfully employed since April 2007. Nevertheless, since that time, with some 
exceptions described above, he did not make any good-faith efforts to pay a variety of 
delinquent debts. He established no repayment plans. Instead, he made a number of 
promises, claimed to have paid several creditors, and disputed several debts without 
providing documentation showing a reasonable basis to do so. Now, once again, he 
intends to review his credit report and examine each delinquent debt with the creditors 
and to require justification before assuming responsibility for those debts. Once 
satisfied, he states he will either pay the debt or work out payment arrangements. 
Applicant’s promises are no longer sufficient. His failure to repay creditors or to arrange 
payment plans reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security 
clearance.  
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least 
under repayment arrangements; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns 
about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, 
considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
 
17 
                                      
 
                                                          
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.126 The insufficient good-faith 
efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments are sufficient to raise continuing security 
concerns. (See AG ¶ 2(a)(1), AG ¶ 2(a)(2), AG ¶ 2(a)(3), AG ¶ 2(a)(4), AG ¶ 2(a)(5), AG 
¶ 2(a)(6), AG ¶ 2(a)(7), and AG ¶ 2(a)(9).) 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:127 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Although there are some positive signs, some efforts to take corrective actions, 
and maintenance of some of his payments on his daily living expenses, these steps are 
simply insufficient to show he can “live within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations.” See AG ¶ 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
