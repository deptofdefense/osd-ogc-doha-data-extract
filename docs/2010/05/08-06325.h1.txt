HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 19 debts totaling $37,488. In the last 
three years she settled and paid 15 SOR and non-SOR collection debts totaling 
$22,186. She has a reasonable plan for resolving her remaining debts. Applicant had 
seven alcohol-related driving arrests from 1992 to July 2006. She stopped consuming 
alcohol in August 2006, except for consuming beer on one occasion in March 2007. She 
actively participates in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Security concerns are mitigated and 
eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 20, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86). (GE 1) On 
October 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) 
and F (financial considerations). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 3) 
 
On November 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. (HE 4) On January 12, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On January 22, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to 
me. On February 11, 2010, and February 26, 2010, DOHA issued hearing notices.1 (HE 
1, 2) On March 10, 2010, Applicant’s hearing was held using video teleconference. 
(Transcript (Tr. 4; HE 1, 2) At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 
1-6) (Tr. 28-32), and Applicant offered 18 exhibits. (Tr. 56-64; AE A-R) There were no 
objections,2 and I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A-R. (Tr. 32, 64) Additionally, I admitted the 
hearing notices, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR. (HE 1-4) On March 16, 
2010, I received the transcript. On April 30, 2010, I received AE S. Department Counsel 
did not object to my consideration of AE S, and AE S is admitted into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.l, except 
for 1.i as well as the debts in 2.a to 2.e and 2.g to 2.o.4 She said the debt in SOR ¶ 2.c 
($792) duplicated the debt in SOR ¶ 2.h ($792), and the debt in SOR ¶ 3.d ($1,154) 
duplicated the debt in SOR ¶ 3.e ($1,154). She denied the remainder of the debts. Her 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor.5 (Tr. 6) The 
government contractor has employed her as a senior manufacturing engineer for 41 
months. (Tr. 66) She was married from 1998 to 2001 and from 2003 to 2005. (Tr. 71) 
Both of Applicant’s former husbands consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, and their 
alcohol abuse contributed to Applicant’s alcohol abuse. (Tr. 72) They were abusive and 
 
1Applicant received notice of the date and time of her hearing from Department Counsel more 
than 15 days prior to the hearing. However, she did not receive her written hearing notice form until 
February 2, 2010. She waived the issue of 15 days’ notice at her hearing. (Tr. 16-18) 
   
2I granted Applicant’s unopposed motion not to admit pages T-62 to T-66 of GE 4 because those 
documents did not pertain to Applicant. (Tr. 28-32; GE 4 at 18-22) Pages T-62 to T-66 are marked on the 
bottom of each page “not admitted.”  
 
3Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
4Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph are from Applicant’s SOR response. (HE 4) 
 
5Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant’s 
November 20, 2006 SF 86. (GE 1)

Applicant obtained restraining orders against them. (GE 1) Applicant is not currently 
married and does not have any children. (Tr. 6, 71) She earned a bachelor of science 
degree in chemical engineering in 1995. (Tr. 6) She has never held a security 
clearance. (Tr. 7) 
  
Applicant disclosed the repossession of her mobile home and multiple delinquent 
debts on her security clearance application. She did not disclose any unpaid taxes or 
bankruptcies. She also disclosed seven arrests for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and 
two DWI convictions. She did not disclose any illegal drug use, or non-DWI criminal 
offenses.     
 
Alcohol consumption 
 
 In 1991, Applicant began to consume alcohol regularly on most Friday evenings 
beginning when she was 21 years old. (Tr. 75; HE 4; SOR ¶ 1.a) In 1992, the police 
arrested Applicant for her first DWI (Tr. 76-77; HE 4; SOR ¶ 1.b) She received one year 
of probation, and the DWI charge was dismissed. (Tr. 77-78) In 1997, the police 
charged Applicant with her second DWI. (Tr. 78-79; HE 4; SOR ¶ 1.c) The DWI charge 
was dismissed. (Tr. 79) 
 
 In January and May 2002, and March and December 2003, the police arrested 
Applicant a total of four times for DWI. (Tr. 79-89; HE 4; SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.g) Her blood 
alcohol content has been as high as .25 or about three times the legal limit. (Tr. 136) 
After her December 2003 DWI arrest, she received a year of unsupervised probation, 
her driver’s license was suspended, and the court required her to complete a substance 
abuse traffic offender’s program. (Tr. 82)  
 
Applicant received her first alcohol treatment and therapy program in February 
2004. (Tr. 77-79, 83) This clinical intervention program consisted of 10 hours of one-on-
one, outpatient counseling, 20 hours of group therapy, and 20 hours of classroom 
education. (Tr. 83) From February to July 27, 2004, she voluntarily enrolled in an 
outpatient treatment and detoxification program, and she refrained from any alcohol 
consumption during this attendance. (Tr. 85-86; SOR ¶ 1.h) However, a few days after 
leaving the program, she returned to alcohol consumption. (Tr. 87) On September 8, 
2004, she checked herself into a detoxification facility, and checked herself out that 
same day because of an interaction she had at the facility with a man who previously 
consumed alcohol with her. (Tr. 87-88, 133; SOR ¶ 1.i) Her departure on September 8, 
2004, was against staff advice. (Tr. 133)   
 
From September 8, 2004 to December 2004, she consumed alcohol; however, 
she did not have any alcohol-related problems. (Tr. 89) From December 2004 until 
January 2006, she lived with her parents and did not consume alcohol. (Tr. 89)  
 
From January 2006 to July 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol on a daily basis 
and gradually increased her alcohol consumption. (Tr. 90) She consumed up to 18 
beers a day during the first six months of 2006. (Tr. 90) In July 2006, Applicant drank 12 
beers, and then drove. (Tr. 92) The police arrested Applicant for DWI. (Tr. 90; SOR ¶

1.j) She pleaded guilty to DWI. (Tr. 97) She received a fine and six months of probation. 
From August 1, 2006, to August 24, 2006, she received in-patient treatment for alcohol 
dependency. (Tr. 93-95,135; SOR ¶ 1.k) The diagnosis of alcohol dependency was 
made the director of a chemical dependency unit of a mental health center.6 (GE 4 at 3)  
 
After receiving the diagnosis of alcohol dependency, Applicant consumed alcohol 
on one occasion in March 2007 at a festival (Tr. 97, 136; SOR 1.l) The “slip” in March 
2007 was due to the false rationalization that she could drink two beers and stop. (Tr. 
100) Instead, she drank six beers and this alcohol consumption confirmed to her that 
she could not control her alcohol consumption or handle responsible drinking. (Tr. 100) 
She has not consumed any alcohol since March 2007. (Tr. 98)  
 
Applicant accepts that she is an alcoholic, and acknowledges she is alcohol 
dependent. (Tr. 100) She has continuously attended AA meetings since August 2007. 
(Tr. 98) She currently attends two to three meetings per week. (Tr. 99) When the 
temptation to consume alcohol is greater, such as during holidays, she attends five AA 
meetings per week. (Tr. 99) She attends eight meetings on a weekend for AA 
conventions. (Tr. 99) Applicant has contact with her AA sponsor usually five days a 
week. (Tr. 99) She has completed all 12 steps of the AA program, and is now on the 
maintenance program encompassed in the last three steps. (Tr. 101) Applicant 
volunteers at an in-patient therapy program at the alcohol treatment center and provides 
one-on-one counseling for alcoholics. (Tr. 102) Applicant is the treasurer for her AA 
group. (Tr. 102) She received her three-year AA chip at the end of March 2010. (Tr. 
138) Her AA sponsor of over three years corroborates Applicant’s descriptions of her 
sobriety, AA participation, and volunteer work to help alcoholics. (AE J)  
 
Department Counsel asked Applicant her future intentions concerning alcohol 
consumption, and Applicant responded: 
 
My future intention is to be absolutely abstinent. I have seen where 
alcohol will take me and I definitely don’t have any plans to go back. I 
have seen what wonderful things can happen from having a sober life. 
Even though I was functioning and holding a job at the time I quit drinking, 
you know, I was also on good terms with my family. I wasn’t enjoying my 
family or being able to participate in my niece and my nephew’s lives. And 
now I can.  .  .  . So I have learned that that life that I considered normal at 
one time is not really what a normal life is. And so my intentions are to 
remain abstinent. (Tr. 103-104)       
 
 
 
 
6The director’s credentials included licensed alcohol and drug abuse counselor (LADAC), which I 
infer is equivalent to licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). (GE 4 at 3) See AG ¶¶ 22(d) and 22(e) 
(listing LCSW as one of several credentials for evaluating or diagnosing a patient as “alcohol 
dependent”).

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant was fired from her employment in February 2004 for absenteeism and 
driving on company property without a driver’s license. (Tr. 69) In 2004, her husband 
was abusive and she suffered from migraines. (Tr. 70) She missed work due to 
migraines. (Tr. 70) From February 2004 to August 2004, she was unemployed. (Tr. 73) 
She received financial support from unemployment compensation. (Tr. 73) From 
December 2004 to August 2005, she was unemployed, and during this period of 
unemployment she lived with her parents. (Tr. 73) She has been employed from August 
2005 to the present. (Tr. 74)  
 
Some of Applicant’s delinquent debt resulted from her divorce. (Tr. 72) She 
assumed full responsibility for the joint debts from her marriage. (Tr. 72) Some of her 
debts resulted from falling while she was drunk and being taken to the hospital in an 
ambulance. (Tr. 105) SOR debts 1.a to 1.l, totaling $19,781, are all medical debts. Her 
medical debts were generated in 2003 to 2004. (Tr. 106) The six debts in SOR ¶¶ 2.g 
($1,713), 2.h ($792), 2.i ($311), 2.j ($299), 2.k ($212), and 2.l ($387) were all medical 
debts being collected by the same company. On April 13, 2009, she sent a certified 
letter to the creditor asking for the status of her debts. (AE A at 1; AE O) She learned 
from the SOR-listed creditor that those six debts were returned to the two original 
creditors. (Tr. 112-113) Applicant paid one of the original creditors, resolving the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 2.i and 2.j; however, she was unable to obtain the information on the other 
four debts from the other original creditor. (Tr. 112-113; AE O, AE R) She received 
financial counsel and generated a budget. (AE S) She promised to continue to attempt 
to obtain the necessary information so that she could resolve the last four debts. 
 
In 1996, Applicant bought a mobile home for $20,000. (Tr. 110) It lost value and 
was a poor investment. (Tr. 105) She made her payments on this secured loan until 
2005. (Tr. 110) She was unable to keep up with her payments, and her mobile home 
was repossessed and sold at auction. (Tr. 110) The creditor in SOR ¶ 2.f ($7,678) 
offered to settle the balance owed on her mobile home for $5,000. (Tr.  111) She paid 
the settlement amount, and her TransUnion Credit Report reflects the payment and 
resolution of this debt. (Tr. 111-112; AE A at 1; AE N at page 3)  
 
On January 24, 2010, Applicant placed the four medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 2.a 
($2,926), 2.b ($2,363), 2.c ($792), and 2.d ($1,154), as well as one credit card debt 
SOR ¶ 2.o ($8,978) into her debt consolidation plan for resolution. (Tr. 107-108, 118; 
AE A at 1; AE M) She made three monthly payments of $297 into the program prior to 
her hearing. (Tr. 131)  
  
The debt in SOR ¶ 2.m ($7,696) is for a delinquent credit card account. (Tr. 114) 
In 2006, it was transferred to another lender. (AE N at 2) Several years ago, she settled 
and paid this debt. (Tr. 115)   
 
On November 1, 2007, Applicant sent the creditor a letter asking for verification 
of the debt in SOR ¶ 2.n ($529). (Tr. 116-118; AE P) The creditor did not provide any 
information about the debt’s origin, and the debt is in dispute. (Tr. 118)

The debt in SOR ¶ 2.p ($217) appears on her December 14, 2006 credit report 
as a medical debt accrued in 2005. (GE 9 at 12) Applicant received contact information 
from Department Counsel, and she promised to contact the creditor. (Tr. 120) This debt 
does not appear on her January 12, 2009, or August 10, 2009 credit reports. (GE 8, 9)  
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 2.q ($62) appears on her December 14, 2006 credit report as 
a television cable-type debt accrued in 2004. (GE 9 at 14) In March 2009, Applicant 
called the creditor, and they were unable to locate the account information. (Tr. 120)  
This debt does not appear on her January 12, 2009, or August 10, 2009 credit reports. 
(GE 8, 9)  
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 2.r ($194) and 2.s ($31) appear on her December 14, 2006 
credit report as telephone-type debts accrued in 2003 and 2004. (GE 9 at 79, 80) 
Department Counsel explained to Applicant how to contact the creditors using the 
information in her 2006 credit report. (Tr. 120-121)  She paid the debt in SOR ¶ 2.s. (AE 
N at 9) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 2.r and 2.s do not appear on her January 12, 2009, or 
August 10, 2009 credit reports. (GE 8, 9)  
 
Applicant’s monthly gross salary is $5,100. (Tr. 68, 123; GE 3 at 13) Her monthly 
net income is $2,850, her monthly expenses are about $2,200, and her monthly 
remainder is $650. (Tr. 124; GE 3 at 13; AE S) She has about $2,200 in her checking 
account, and about $22,000 in her IRA. (Tr. 125) She purchased her vehicle, a 2006 
Honda, using a loan from her 401K account, which she is repaying through a $460 
monthly automatic allotment from her salary. (Tr. 125-126) She does not have a 
personal credit card. (Tr. 126) Her income taxes are current. (Tr. 126) 
 
Applicant has not accrued any new delinquent debts after 2005. (Tr. 137) Her 
August 14, 2009, credit report shows “paid” for the six collection accounts: $167 (AE N 
at 5); $132 (AE I; AE N at 8); $315 (AE N at 8); $560 (AE E; AE N at 8); $136 (AE N at 
9); and $94 (AE F; AE N at 9). She provided proof of payment of four non-SOR 
collection accounts:  (1) $2,009 on January 29, 2007 (AE B); (2) $2,200 on May 2, 2008 
(AE C); (3) $177 on March 26, 2009 (AE H); and (4) $381 on March 26, 2009 (AE I).  
 
 In April 2010, Applicant received financial counseling and generated a budget.7 
She plans to save sufficient funds to permit her to begin good-faith negotiations for 
settling each remaining unresolved debt with a lump-sum payment. (AE S) She 
promised to show financial responsibility and pay her debts, with the goal of achieving a 
good-credit rating.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or.

10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this 
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 08-
06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 
2009).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and F (financial considerations).  
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) - 22(g) 
provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b), 22(d), and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not consume alcohol at 
work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. Her alcohol consumption problem 
was not diagnosed or evaluated “by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., 
physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist).” Applicant has not failed to comply with 
a court order not to consume alcohol. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(a), 22(c), 22(e), and 22(f) apply. Applicant had seven DWI arrests from 
1992 to July 2006, and she had DWI convictions for her 2003 and July 2006 DWI 
offenses. Even though she was not convicted of five DWIs, I conclude she was in fact 
DWI on those occasions. In the first six months of 2006, she consumed up to 18 beers 
in a day, and her blood alcohol content for one of her DWIs was .25. This level of 
alcohol consumption constitutes “binge” consumption. The director of a recognized 
alcohol-treatment program, whose credentials are equivalent to a LCSW, wrote a letter 
indicating Applicant was alcohol dependent. See n. 6 at page 2, supra. Applicant was 
properly diagnosed as alcohol dependent in August 2006. After receiving alcohol 
treatment in 2004, and 2006, and after being diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2006, 
she consumed alcohol on one occasion in March 2007. Her alcohol consumption in 
March 2007 constitutes a relapse. She had a previous relapse in 2006 after alcohol-
related treatment in 2004.   
 
  “Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, 
there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden 
concerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant 
to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
  Four Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 23 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial 
alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a 
fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.8  
 
AG ¶¶ 23(b) and 23(d) fully apply. Applicant had seven DWIs from 1992 to July 
2006. On August 24, 2006, Applicant was diagnosed as being alcohol dependent. She 
fully acknowledged and completely and candidly described her history of alcohol 
consumption. She stopped her alcohol consumption in August 2006, and then relapsed 
or “slipped” in March 2007, when she drank six beers. She did not minimize her alcohol 
consumption problem. Statements from colleagues, friends, her supervisor, and her AA 
sponsor about her abstaining from alcohol consumption after August 2006 provided 
valuable corroboration of her statement. She successfully completed an alcohol

treatment or counseling program, and responded well to therapies. She continued her 
AA participation and has gone to hundreds of AA meetings over the last three years. 
She has completely abstained from alcohol consumption since March 2007, and has 
only consumed alcohol once (one day in March 2007) since August 2006.9 She has 
taken all reasonable actions to ensure her continued successful rehabilitation, and 
therefore she receives full mitigating credit under AG ¶¶ 23(b) and 23(d).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her security clearance application, her SOR response, and her statement 
at her hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR lists 19 debts totaling $37,488. In the last three years she 
settled and paid 15 SOR and non-SOR collection debts totaling $22,186. She settled 
 
9For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant continued to drink 
even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge’s application of MC 3.”  In ISCR Case No. 
05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a 
clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most 
recent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to 
intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued alcohol consumption was 
not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 
04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three 
years before hearing, and reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance).

and paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 2.f ($7,778), 2.i ($311), 2.j ($299), 2.m ($7,697), and 2.s 
($31). The debts in SOR ¶¶ 2.c ($1,154) and 2.d ($792) were duplications of the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 2.e ($1,154) and 2.h ($792). On January 24, 2010, Applicant placed the five 
debts totaling $16,213 listed in SOR ¶¶ 2.a ($2,926), 2.b ($2,363), 2.c ($792), 2.d 
($1,154), and SOR ¶ 2.o ($8,978) into her debt consolidation plan for resolution. She 
made three monthly payments of $297 into the program prior to her hearing. Seven 
debts totaling $3,314 remain for her to address more fully. Most of her SOR debts were 
delinquent for over five years. The Government established the disqualifying conditions 
in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant has provided sufficient evidence to rebut the validity of the three debts 
totaling $473 listed in SOR ¶¶ 2.p ($217), 2.q ($62), and 2.r ($194). Although the three 
debts appeared in her 2006 credit report, and did not appear in her January 12, 2009, or 
August 10, 2009, credit reports. She contacted one of the creditors, and they were 
unable to locate a record of the debt. She is still investigating the other two debts, and if 
she can validate them, I am confident that she will pay them. 
 
Five debts are owed to the same medical creditor, and Applicant has contacted 
the creditor to seek payment information for the debts totaling $2,312 listed in SOR ¶¶ 
2.g ($1,713), 2.k ($212), and 2.l ($387). Applicant has not accrued any new delinquent 
debts after 2005. She paid 10 non-SOR collection accounts since 2007, totaling $6,171.  
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
Applicant’s conduct warrants partial application of AG ¶ 20(b). Her most recent 
marriage ended in 2005. Her husband was abusive. Applicant and her husband 
consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. Applicant was injured several times while she 
was intoxicated, generating medical bills. She had absences from work due to migraine 
headaches. She was unemployed from February to August 2004 and from December 
2004 to August 2005. She does not receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because her 
excessive alcohol consumption contributed to the other problems in her life. 
Nevertheless, starting in August 2006, she showed responsibility, self-discipline, and 
tenacity in maintaining contact with her creditors and making payments.10 By August 
2006, she was starting her new employment, had ended an abusive relationship with 
her spouse, and had ended her alcohol consumption. She acted aggressively and 
conscientiously to resolve her delinquent debts. She disclosed her delinquent debts and 
financial problems on her security clearance application. She established that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances after August 2006.    
 
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling. She created a 
reasonable plan to resolve her delinquent debts and followed through with it, 
accomplishing complete resolution of seven SOR debts (two duplications, five paid 
debts) totaling $22,186. Five additional debts totaling $16,213 are in an established 
payment plan. Three debts totaling $2,312 are owed to the same medical creditor, and 
she has contacted the creditor to seek payment information for these debts. Based on 
her track record of debt payment since 2007, I found her promise to resolve her 
remaining, unresolved debts to be credible.11 Three debts totaling $473 are not 
established. Applicant understands what she must do to maintain her financial 
responsibility. Applicant’s credit counselor cited the state statute of limitations of five 
years in her post-hearing debt-payment advice. (AE S) Under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence, debts that are beyond the statute of limitations for collections cannot be 
mitigated solely because they are not collectable.12  
 
10“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)) A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
11 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not 
a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
12The statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant’s legal responsibility to 
pay the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of 
decisions the Appeal Board has rejected the statute of limitations for debts generated through contracts, 
which is the law in all 50 states, as automatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG ¶ 
20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 18, 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008). See also n. 12, infra.

Applicant also established partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) by showing some 
good-faith13 in the resolution of her SOR debts by admitting responsibility for them and 
paying or resolving over 60% of her delinquent SOR debts prior to her hearing.   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the debt in SOR ¶ 2.n. Applicant documented her dispute 
of the debt in SOR ¶ 2.n ($529) by asking for the basis of the debt and not receiving a 
response from the creditor. Applicant admitted her responsibility for all of her debts. 
Applicant did not provide documentation showing she disputed any of her other SOR 
debts.   
 
In sum, Applicant diligently and responsibly resolved or is attempting to resolve 
her delinquent SOR debts. Since August 2006, she has stopped consuming alcohol 
(except for one occasion in March 2007). She has made significant progress in paying 
her creditors. She received financial counseling and understands what she must do to 
show her financial responsibility and maintain her eligibility for a security clearance. She 
provided documentary proof of resolution of numerous debts. I am confident she will 
keep her promise to pay her delinquent debts14 because of her track record of financial 
progress shown over the last three years. Financial consideration concerns are 
mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
13The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)) 
 
14 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through 
credit reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar 
the government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security 
context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional 
clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case 
No. 04-03907 at 2 (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary 
security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her 
financial problems.” and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s clearance is conditional.

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine

circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c) I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines G and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
significant; however, they do not warrant revocation of her security clearance. 
Applicant’s failure to pay or resolve her just debts in accordance with contracts she 
signed was not prudent or responsible. She has a history of financial problems. Her 
credit reports, security clearance application, and SOR response listed delinquent 
debts. Her alcohol consumption is not a circumstance beyond her control and it 
contributed to her financial woes. From 1992 to August 2006, Applicant engaged in a 
pattern of alcohol abuse and dependence manifested by seven DWIs. She was 
correctly diagnosed as alcohol dependent in August 2006.  
      
The rationale for granting or reinstating Applicant’s clearance is more substantial. 
She was forthright and candid in her security clearance application, her responses to 
DOHA interrogatories, her SOR response, and at her hearing about her financial and 
alcohol-related problems. Several problems partially beyond her control adversely 
affected her financial status. Her debts resulted from divorce, unemployment, her 
spouse’s financial irresponsibility, and her medical problems. Of her 19 SOR debts 
totaling $37,488, she completely resolved seven SOR debts (two duplications, five paid 
debts) totaling $22,186. Five debts totaling $16,213 are in an established payment plan. 
She is investigating three debts totaling $2,312. She credibly promised to resolve her 
remaining, unresolved debts to be credible. She understands what she must do to 
maintain her financial responsibility. She paid 10 non-SOR collection accounts totaling 
$6,171. Her rent is current and she does not have any car loans or credit cards. I am 
confident she will keep her promise to avoid future delinquent debt. The Appeal Board 
has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
 
16 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Applicant is 40 years old. She has achieved some important educational and 
employment goals, demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She 
acknowledges that she is an alcoholic, and she ended her alcohol consumption in 
August 2006, except for consuming alcohol once in March 2007. She has attended 
hundreds of AA sessions, and volunteers at a clinic for alcoholics. Applicant received 
financial counseling and generated a budget. She is an intelligent person, and she 
understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her financial responsibility. 
There is simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment.  
 
Applicant has demonstrated her patriotism and trustworthiness through her 
service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. Character witnesses described 
Applicant as professional, honest, and diligent. She is an asset to her employer.     
 
I conclude Applicant has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to 
mitigate the alcohol consumption and financial considerations security concerns. I take 
this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 
(1988), my “careful consideration of the whole-person factors,”15 and supporting 
evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and 
my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is eligible for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a to 2.s:  For Applicant 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
