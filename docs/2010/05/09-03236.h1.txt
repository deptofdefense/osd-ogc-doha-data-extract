Decision

GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 22, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing version of a Security 
Clearance Application (e-QIP).1 On July 14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his financial 
situation. He responded to the interrogatories on August 27, 2009.2 On November 25, 
2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP), dated December 22, 2008.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated August 27, 2009).

modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access 
to Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 14, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated January 13, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on February 24, 2010, and the case was 
assigned to me on March 9, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 18, 2010, 
and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on April 20, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits and eight Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant and one other witness testified. On 
April 27, 2010, despite the fact that the record had previously closed, Applicant 
submitted two additional exhibits that were also admitted into evidence, without 
objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 29, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.d. and 1.e.) of the SOR, and denied the remaining allegations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., 
and 1.f.). 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a communications technician,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He had 
previously held a security clearance during 1974 – 1977, while serving on active duty 
with the U.S. Army.4  
 
Applicant has been married four times. He married his first wife in August 1974, 
and they were divorced in January 1984. He married his second wife in March 1984, 
and they were divorced in March 1990. He married his third wife in November 1991, and 
they were divorced in March 2000. He married his fourth and current wife in November 
2001.5 He has a number of children and step-children.6

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant was initially a senior systems engineer (at one point earning $75,000 
per year)7 and subsequently a safety engineer with a large international automotive 
manufacturing company from June 1988 until March 2002.8 In 2001, he sustained a 
shoulder injury in a non-work related accident which necessitated two surgeries.9 When 
his car was rear-ended in another accident, he sustained additional shoulder damage, 
necessitating two more surgeries.10 Because of the extensive time lost during recovery 
from his surgeries and anticipated surgeries, Applicant’s employer terminated him.11 
Although he was unemployed from March 2002 until December 2004,12 he continued to 
receive $40,000 per year - a significant percentage of his former salary - as part of his 
long-term disability benefits.13  
 
In October 2002, Applicant relocated from an upper Midwestern state to a 
Southeastern state.14 In 2003, his wife got homesick, and they returned to their original 
home state where they purchased a residence for $178,000, with $15,000 down and the 
remainder financed, with a monthly mortgage payment of $1,100 to $1,200.15 Two 
years later, she again became homesick, and they relocated again to the Southeastern 
state where they purchased a residence for $300,000, with a monthly mortgage 
payment of $1,400.16 A little over a year before the hearing, Applicant was unable to 
maintain his monthly payments on his home in the Southeastern state, and, threatened 
with foreclosure, he sold it at a short sale, sustaining an unspecified loss described as 
“huge.”17  
 
Applicant returned to the workforce in December 2004, and held a variety of 
positions with several different employers, and went through a two-month period of 
unemployment during November-December 2008,18 before accepting a position with his

current employer as an electronics technician in December 2008.19 In 2009, he earned 
$57,300.20 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until he was first injured in 
2001.21 According to Applicant, until that time, his credit history was excellent.22 When 
he was injured, “things started to snowball out of control, . . . [a]nd it has just steadily 
[went] downhill from there. . . [a] little bit at a time, but it happened all the same.”23 In 
March 2008, Applicant’s wife starting having serious health-related problems, leading to 
several surgical procedures.24 Their combined medical problems depleted their 
savings.25 
 
The SOR identified six purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit 
reports from 2008 and 2009, totaling approximately $55,794. Some accounts have been 
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts 
are referenced repeatedly in both credit reports, in many instances duplicating other 
accounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agent name or under a 
different creditor or collection agent name. Some accounts are identified by complete 
account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some 
instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.  
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a. is a 2004 judgment in the amount reported to 
be $4,826,26 stemming from unpaid rent on a lot upon which Applicant’s home stood.27 
Applicant rented the lot in 2000 when he purchased his “manufactured” home.28 His 
rent payments were current when he relocated, and for a period thereafter, but on 
occasion he did not send in the full payment.29 He tried to balance out his payments, 
and sometimes paid $300 and other times paid $500.30 Applicant claims he voluntarily

Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated November 6, 2009), at 1, wherein it appears that the original unpaid balance 
may have been $1,308, and an increased balance as of September 2009, was $2,878.

returned the home to the lender, and was advised that the rent would be paid until the 
home was sold.31 It apparently was not, and the unpaid balance grew. In 2004, long 
after Applicant and his wife had relocated, the creditor filed a complaint against 
Applicant in a local county circuit court, and obtained a judgment in the amount of about 
$3,500.32 Upon learning of the judgment, on February 2, 2004, Applicant paid the 
creditor $3,519,33 and Applicant claims he was told by the manager at the creditor that 
the judgment had been dismissed.34 A receipt of that payment was subsequently 
acknowledged by a debt collector for the creditor with a note that the account was 
considered “paid in full.”35 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.b. is purportedly a delinquent account with the 
same creditor as in SOR ¶ 1.a., in the amount of $2,878.36 The account, with an initial 
amount of $2,628, was listed in the credit report in August 2003, and reported in 
September 2009.37 The debt collector is the same one as in SOR ¶ 1.a., and the file 
number is identical.38 It appears that the “account” listed separately in the credit report 
is actually an intermediate report for the account reflected in SOR ¶ 1.a. As noted 
above, a receipt of the February 2004 payment was subsequently acknowledged by the 
debt collector for the creditor with a note that the account was considered “paid in full 39
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.c. is purportedly a delinquent account with the

an initial amount of $1,308, was listed in the credit report in August 2003, and reported 
in February 2004.41 The debt collector is not the same one as in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b., 
but the file number is identical.42 It appears that the “account” listed separately in the 
credit report is actually another intermediate report for the account reflected in SOR ¶¶

The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.d. is a collection account with Discover 
Financial Services on a Discover Card account opened in 1994.44 Applicant used the 
card primarily for emergencies and food.45 The credit limit was $1,500,46 In November 
2009, the account balance had risen to $2,139, with a past due balance of $133.47 
Applicant initially admitted the allegation, and explained the delinquency was caused 
because he was unable to make the payments due to his wife’s medical costs.48 He 
claimed to have made the required monthly payments each month until he called the 
creditor to inform them of a “hardship” situation, at which time his monthly payments 
were reduced to about $44.49 He contends he made his reduced monthly payments for 
about one year before stopping them four months prior to the hearing.50 He has not 
submitted any documentation to support his contentions regarding payments.  
 
Applicant also stated the card number was fraudulently used by someone, and 
he was advised that the account had been closed by the creditor.51 He has not 
submitted any documentation to support the allegation of fraudulent use. He claimed he 
no longer receives monthly statements, and has no idea what his unpaid balance might 
be,52 but acknowledged that the creditor had offered to reduce the outstanding balance 
if Applicant made an immediate $500 payment.53 The offer was declined. Applicant 
plans to resolve this delinquent account some time in the future by filing for bankruptcy 
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.54 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.e. is a collection account through CitiBank

used the card to purchase a range and refrigerator.56 The credit limit was $3,320.57 In 
November 2009, the account balance had risen to $3,782, and it was charged off.58 
Applicant initially admitted the allegation, and explained the delinquency was caused 
because he was unable to make the payments due to his wife’s medical costs.59 As with 
his Discover Card, he claimed to have made the required monthly payments each 
month until he called the creditor to inform them of a “hardship” situation, at which time 
his monthly payments were reduced to about $33.60 He contends he made his reduced 
monthly payments for about one year before stopping them five or six months prior to 
the hearing.61 He has not submitted any documentation to support his contentions 
regarding payments. Applicant plans to resolve this delinquent account some time in the 
future by filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.62 
 
The account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.f. is a collection account obtained from the 
original creditor by Green Tree Servicing, LLC (Green Tree), on a home mortgage loan 
for a “manufactured” home that Applicant purchased some time in 2000.63 The original 
purchase price was $60,000 to $62,000.64 Applicant estimated he paid the original 
mortgage holder between $750 and $800 per month before the account became 
delinquent after he relocated.65 Applicant claims that when he relocated in October 
2002, he enlisted the services of an agent to sell his manufactured home. He received 
three offers, but the original mortgage holder rejected them. He contacted the original 
mortgage holder directly and was purportedly advised to voluntarily relinquish the home 
to them because of better avenues to sell the property. In return, he was advised that 
once it was sold, he would not be responsible for any deficiency. He accepted the offer 
and voluntarily returned the home to the lender.66  
 
In about 2003 or 2004, Applicant claims he was contacted by Green Tree and 
informed the original mortgage holder had gone bankrupt and Green Tree had taken

over the account.67 Green Tree reviewed the arrangement and disavowed it, telling 
Applicant the arrangement was no longer valid. Green Tree demanded the difference 
between the balance of the original lien note of the home and the selling price.68 Green 
Tree reported the deficiency to be $42,867, and that amount was eventually charged off 
to profit and loss.69 Applicant spoke to a representative of Green Tree only one time 
and found him “extremely rude.”70 He subsequently disputed the characterization of the 
transaction as “involuntary,” but was apparently unsuccessful as that characterization 
remains in his most recent credit report.71 Applicant no longer possesses any 
documentation related to the entire transaction,72 and was unable to furnish any 
documentation to support his contentions. He has had no contact with Green Tree since 
approximately 2004.73 Applicant plans to resolve this delinquent account some time in 
the future by filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.74 
 
In August 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating 
monthly net income of $2,496, monthly expenses of $1,989, no monthly debt payments 
on any delinquent accounts, and a net remainder of $507 available for discretionary 
spending.75 Applicant’s wife does not work outside their home, but she does receive 
child support payments on an irregular, periodic basis.76 She received $200 two weeks 
prior to the hearing.77 Applicant acknowledged he never received financial counseling or 
debt consolidation guidance.78 He also contended he was current on all financial 
obligations and would not have any delinquencies in the future.79 Nevertheless, during 
the hearing, he admitted that in addition to the SOR delinquencies, his J.C. Penney 
account, several medical accounts, and two of his wife’s credit cards are delinquent.80

Applicant has already paid his bankruptcy attorney $275, and as soon as he 
accumulates the remainder of the $1,000 retainer, he and his wife intend to file for joint 
bankruptcy.81  
 
Character and Employment References 
 
Despite his financial delinquencies, Applicant’s performance has apparently not 
suffered. His immediate supervisor states Applicant is a “great asset to the operations 
here, is always on time, has a great attitude, and fits in well with his coworkers.”82 The 
site manager for the prime contractor characterized him as “intelligent and motivated,” 
as well as “reliable and dependable.”83 Other coworkers refer to him in the following 
terms: dependable, reliable, trustworthy, honest, and forthright. In July 2009, Applicant 
was elected to the position of shop steward for his union’s local.84  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”85 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”86   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The

administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”87 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.88  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”89 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”90 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
87 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying. As 
noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2001, 
when he sustained his initial injury. Prior to that injury, he had a great job, earning up to 
$75,000 per year, and his credit history was excellent. After the injury, his finances went 
steadily down hill and out of control. Additional injuries eventually resulted in a job loss 
and unemployment from March 2002 until December 2004. Thereafter, accounts 
became delinquent and were sent to collection, some were charged off, and one went to 
judgment. He relocated several times between two geographically distant states, each 
time incurring relocation expenses and associated costs. Despite promises to pay 
certain accounts,91 and claims to have paid others, with the exception of one creditor, 
he has failed to keep his bills current. Except for the allegation pertaining to the 
judgment, he has not submitted any documentation to support his contentions regarding 
payments supposedly made or accounts supposedly disputed. As soon as he 
accumulates the remainder of the attorney retainer, Applicant and his wife intend to file 
for joint bankruptcy and seek discharge of his financial delinquencies. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(e) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
91 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@92 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced when he was initially injured in 2001, 
eventually reinjured, and terminated by his employer in March 2002. His injuries, along 
with his wife’s medical problems, led to his financial problems which were, in turn, 
exacerbated by his two periods of unemployment (March 2002 to December 2004, and 
November to December 2008), and the expenses associated with his multiple 
relocations. Because the financial situation is continuing in nature, despite having 
initially commenced in 2001, he receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(a). His physical 
limitations were eliminated long ago, and his wife’s health issues were a major focus of 
attention in the past, but a lesser consideration now. While the health issues are unlikely 
to recur, Applicant’s handling of his finances, under the circumstances, does cast doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Likewise, he receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while the conditions 
that resulted in the financial problem were largely initially beyond Applicant’s control 
(e.g., loss of his employment and his and his wife’s unexpected medical emergencies), 
Applicant failed to act responsibly under the circumstances. While unemployed from 
March 2002 until December 2004, Applicant continued to earn $40,000 per year as part 
of his long-term disability benefits. And, rather than consolidating and minimizing 
expenses, he relocated from the upper Midwest to the Southeast, back to the upper 
Midwest, and eventually back to the Southeast. Relocation expenses and purchasing 
ever more expensive residences simply increased his expenditures and did little to 
reduce his delinquencies.93 AG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has never 
92 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case 
No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
93 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when

received financial counseling or debt consolidation guidance, but it is anticipated that his 
bankruptcy will include counseling. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay the one judgment-creditor in February 2004, well before the SOR was issued. By 
paying off that judgment, Applicant effectively resolved three duplicate SOR allegations 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Thereafter, he abandoned all such efforts. Applicant did not 
act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. 
Instead, he declared his intentions to contact his creditors and eliminate his debts or 
work out payment arrangements. At times he claimed he had already made payments 
to several creditors, but he was unable to furnish any documentary evidence to support 
his contentions. Although he denied other delinquent debts, in reality, there are other 
delinquent non-SOR debts. He chose to dispute the Discover Card and Green Tree 
debts, and he failed to provide documentation establishing any reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of those debts. Applicant failed to establish any type of 
repayment plan when he could have done so. Instead, he delayed and disputed. 
Moreover, since 2004, it appears he has taken no significant actions to address the 
satisfaction of his delinquent debts.94 AG ¶ 20(d) has very limited application. AG ¶ 
20(e) does not apply. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
 
94 The Appeal Board has previously held that “[A] applicant must do more than merely show that he or she 
relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim” he or she initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004).

There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When these 
problems first began, Applicant had a great job, earning up to $75,000 per year, and his 
credit history was excellent. After his initial injury, his finances went steadily down hill 
and out of control. Additional injuries eventually resulted in a job loss and unemployment 
from March 2002 until December 2004. And his wife experienced severe health issues. 
He initiated a good-faith effort to repay the one judgment-creditor in February 2004, well 
before the SOR was issued. By paying off that judgment, Applicant effectively resolved 
three duplicative SOR allegations. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the unemployment and reduced earnings were initially circumstances beyond his 
control, Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a variety of creditors, but 
either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued to accumulate 
delinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. Even while unemployed, Applicant 
continued to receive $40,000 per year as part of his long-term disability benefits. He has 
been gainfully employed since December 2004 (with the brief exception of two months 
in 2008). Nevertheless, since February 2004, with the exceptions described above, he 
did not make significant good-faith efforts to pay a variety of delinquent debts. He 
established no repayment plans. Instead, he made a number of promises, claimed to 
have paid several creditors, and disputed several debts. Now, rather than paying off his 
debts or working out payment arrangements, he has decided to seek bankruptcy 
discharge of his debts. His failure to repay creditors or to arrange payment plans, while 
creating new debts, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a 
security clearance.  
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least 
under repayment arrangements; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns 
about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, 
considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.95 The insufficient good-faith 
efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments are sufficient to raise continuing security 
concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:96 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
95 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
96 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
15 
                                      
 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Although there are some positive signs, such as efforts to take corrective actions, 
and maintenance of some of his payments on his daily living expenses, these steps are 
simply insufficient to show he can “live within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations.” See AG ¶ 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
