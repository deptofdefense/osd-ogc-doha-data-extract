FOR APPLICANT
Pro se

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 8, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On March 11, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider
denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues: whether the Judge failed to consider record evidence
favorable to Applicant and whether the Judge’s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  
The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has applied for a job with
a Defense contractor, to serve as a linguist and cultural advisor.  He had immigrated to the U.S. from
Pakistan in the early 1970s and became a naturalized citizen in the early 1990s.  
Applicant had significant delinquent debts, including one owed to the state lottery
commission for $68,501.  He incurred these debts from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, when he
owned a grocery store.  The store failed during an economic downturn.  Additionally, Applicant’s
store was robbed, which also caused him economic loss.  
In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted the business downturn, a
circumstance beyond Applicant’s control which affected his financial condition.  However, the Judge
stated that “Applicant offered no evidence that he has made any payments to any creditors.  There
is no evidence that he has contacted any of his creditors.  In short, there is no evidence the Applicant
has acted responsibly under the circumstances.  There are no clear indications that his financial
problem is being resolved or is under control.  He has not established financial responsibility.”
Decision at 9.  Accordingly, the Judge held that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security
concerns in his case.
Applicant’s brief appears to contend that Applicant submitted documents to the Judge after
the hearing but that the documents were not considered.  However, the Judge’s decision indicates
that the documents in question were admitted into evidence.  Decision at 2.  Applicant has not
rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,
2008).
After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data
and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, “including a ‘rational connection between
the facts found and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,
371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge’s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general
standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the
national security.’”  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).
