GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct and 
financial considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 6, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
EPSQ version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On September 16, 2007, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of 
interrogatories pertaining to his financial situation and other unspecified issues. He 
responded to the interrogatories on November 5, 2007.2 On October 20, 2009, DOHA 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated July 6, 2006.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 5-A (Original of Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated November 5, 2007); 
Government Exhibit 5 (Copy of Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated November 5, 2007.

Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
(Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) 
and F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 26, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, undated but notarized, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on January 15, 2010, and the case was 
assigned to Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran on January 27, 2010. It was 
reassigned to me on February 12, 2010, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on March 12, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
April 1, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, 13 Government exhibits and 2 Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant and one other witness testified. The 
record remained open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on April 
12, 2010, he submitted five additional documents. Four were admitted into evidence as 
Applicant exhibits C through F, respectively, without objection; however, Department 
Counsel objected to the fifth document (Applicant exhibit G for identification) on the 
grounds that the unsigned document was hearsay and was offered for the truth of the 
matter asserted. I sustained the objection and rejected the document. The transcript 
(Tr.) was received on April 8, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the Guideline F factual 
allegations (¶¶ 2.a. through 2.z.) and one of the Guideline E factual allegations (¶ 1.c.) 
of the SOR. He denied the remaining Guideline E factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.). 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
acting lead technician,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He had 
previously been granted a security clearance in 1984.4 He served on active duty with 
the U.S. Army from July 1984 until July 1987, and in the Army Reserve from July 1987 
until May 1990.5 After his discharge, Applicant was employed by a number of employers 
in a variety of positions, including electronic bench technician, electronic helper, and 
3 Tr. at 36-37.

electronic technician. He also went through a five-month period of unemployment 
(August 1998 until January 1999).6 He has been with his current employer since April 
2006.7 
 
Applicant has been married since May 1996.8 He and his wife have two children, 
born in 1995 and 2002, respectively.9  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 On March 18, 2002, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR alleging security concerns 
under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), F (Financial Considerations), G (Alcohol 
Consumption), and J (Criminal Conduct).10 Applicant elected to have his case decided 
on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 25, 2002, Administrative Judge 
Richard A. Cefola issued a decision that it was “not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.”11Applicant 
continued to work for the same employer, but was relocated to a position not requiring a 
security cleara 12
 
 In response to interrogatories previously sent to him by DOHA, on November 5, 
2007, Applicant submitted a number of letters purportedly from various creditors 
indicating either that he made payment arrangements, had been making payments, or 
that the creditor had acknowledged errors in reflecting delinquencies. One letter, 
purportedly from the U.S. Department of Education, dated October 29, 2007, with an 
illegible signature, states:13 
 
In our recent conversation you had indicated to us that your student loans 
were listed outstanding on your credit report. We understand our concern 
and want to assure you that you are in excellent standing with the US 
Department of Education. All your payments of $630.00 have been 
received every month. We would like to Thank You for keeping current 
with your payments.

DOHA subsequently followed up on the status of the account (SOR ¶ 1.p.), and 
on December 7, 2007, the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter indicating 
Applicant’s account was in collection, and his payment history reflected the two most 
recent payment checks had been returned.14 On March 20, 2008, the U.S. Department 
of Education commented on the purported October 27, 2007 letter previously submitted 
by Applicant, which he attached to his response to DOHA’s interrogatories.15 
 
After reviewing the alleged October 29, 2007 Department of Education 
letter sent to [Applicant], our office of Direct Loans . . . was unable to find 
any record that the Department sent this letter. In addition, Direct Loans 
indicated that the letterhead format was incorrect, and that if they had sent 
the letter, a Direct Loans letterhead would have been used. Additional 
concerns I find include improper language, an Education address used in 
place of the borrower’s address and no printed signature block. Based 
upon our research, the letter in question does not appear to be from the 
Department of Education; instead, it appears to be some veiled attempt to 
imitate a Department letter. 
 
In reference to [Applicant’s] account status with the U.S. Department of 
Education, his balance, as of today, is $100,119.19 (includes principal, 
interest and projected collection costs). 
 
 Another letter, purportedly from a cable provider (SOR ¶ 1.s.), dated October 23, 
2007, with an illegible signature, refers to previously agreed payment arrangements and 
a payment already made.16 In another letter, purportedly from a different cable provider 
(SOR ¶ 1.q.), dated October 25, 2007, also with an illegible signature, the creditor 
apologizes for mistakenly seeking payment on an account in which the unpaid balance 
had been discharged in bankruptcy in 2002.17 Still another letter, purportedly from an 
automobile finance company, dated October 24, 2007, again with an illegible signature, 
apologizes for an accounting error on Applicant’s account, and states his account is in 
“execellent standing.”18 The final letter, from a collection agency representing a medical 
provider (SOR ¶ 1.r.), dated October 25, 2007, without any signature, acknowledges a 
payment bringing the account to current status.19 
 
 Applicant denied drafting, doctoring, forging, making up, or creating any of the 
aforementioned letters which he submitted to DOHA in response to the interrogatories, 
14 Government Exhibit 4 (Letter from U.S. Department of Education, dated December 7, 2007).

and has no idea why they would have been sent to him if they were not authentic.20 
Applicant stated he never contacted the U.S. Department of Education regarding their 
letter, but was happy that he had the letter.21 After comparing the style, formats, fonts, 
and signatures of the subject documents, along with the commentary furnished by the 
U.S. Department of Education, I find that the documents are not authentic, and are most 
likely forgeries.   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2002. At some 
point prior to November 2002, Applicant’s unsecured consumer debt reached a certain 
level, and he and his wife decided to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code.22 He listed total liabilities of $157,435, including about $94,000 in 
student loans and about $63,435 in unsecured debts.23 In July 2003, the unsecured 
debts were discharged, but Applicant remained responsible for the student loans.24  
 
Applicant’s financial habits did not change after the bankruptcy.25 Other than 
disconnecting cable television, he did nothing to prevent new debts from becoming 
delinquent.26 He offered no reason for his failure to adjust his habits or address his 
financial situation.27 At some unspecified point after the bankruptcy discharge, his 
accounts again became delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection or 
charged off. Applicant could not explain why even the smallest of his debts had not 
been taken care of.28 
 
20 Tr. at 28-34. It is interesting to note that Applicant Exhibit G for identification, which was submitted after 
the hearing, and which was objected to by Department Counsel and rejected by me, purports to be a letter from 
Applicant’s wife (unsigned), in which she took full responsibility for forging the identified documents.

one particular collection agency $977 to be applied to unspecified delinquent accounts, leaving an unpaid balance of 
$284.53. See Receipt for Payment, dated October 4, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, supra note 2. On 
November 2, 2007, he made payments to four different creditors identified in the SOR: $719 (¶ 2.m.), $285 (¶ 2.n.), 
$166 (¶ 2.s.), and $440 (¶ 2.x.). See MoneyGram receipts, also attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, id.

 Because of his relative inaction pertaining to his delinquent student loans,29 the 
U.S. Department of Education indicated it intended to collect the debt by administrative 
wage garnishment. Applicant agreed to a rehabilitation plan but the loan was not 
rehabilitated because two payments were returned for insufficient funds.30 Instead, a 
wage garnishment order was sent to Applicant’s employer in October 2008, and 
effective November 21, 2008, the first garnishment payment was received from 
Applicant’s employer.31 As of August 24, 2009, Applicant owed $72,986.72 principal, 
$10,081.36 interest, and $20,218.77 projected collection costs.32 
 
In addition to the allegation pertaining to Applicant’s bankruptcy, the SOR 
identified 25 purportedly continuing delinquencies, including the student loan account, 
as reflected by seven credit reports, including one from 2006,33 three from 2007,34one 
from 2008,35 one from 2009,36 and one from 2010,37 totaling approximately $89,901. Of 
that amount, $83,308 is for student loans. Some accounts have been transferred, 
reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are 
referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in many instances duplicating other 
accounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agent name, or under a 
different creditor or collection agent name. Some accounts are identified by complete 
account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some 
instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. Those 
debts listed in the SOR, all of which Applicant admitted, and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports, documents submitted by Applicant, and 
Applicant’s written and testimonial comments relative thereto, are described below: 
29 Applicant made only “sporadic” payments between January 25, 2007 and October 29, 2007, and his loan 
status was changed to “defaulted.” See Government Exhibit 2 (Letter from U.S. Department of Education, dated 
August 24, 2009), at 1.

Applicant and his family have continuing medical issues which generate medical 
expenses. His wife has a degenerative lumbar disc, requiring several surgeries and 
continuing pain management; his daughter has chronic allergies; and he had a colon 
tumor.66 In addition to the SOR debts, Applicant now has additional, non-SOR, 
accounts which have become delinquent. His payment on March 31, 2010, partially 
addressed some of those non-SOR 67
 
On November 5, 2007, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement 
indicating monthly joint net income of $4,564, monthly expenses of $3,945, with no 
scheduled monthly debt payments, and a net remainder of $619 available for 
discretionary spending.68 Applicant currently earns $30 per hour. After the $400 per 
month student loan garnishment, the monthly joint net income is between $3,600 and 
$3,900, leaving less funds available for discretionary spending.69 
 
Applicant has accepted responsibility for his “complete lack of attention to 
personal and financial matters.”70 He added, “My abilities as both a technician and a 
lead have thus far allowed me to advance in my knowledge and career without being 
worried about the adverse effects of my dismal personal affairs. I realize now as I guess 
I always did that this bill would come due.”71  
 
Character References 
 
Applicant’s immediate supervisor has known Applicant for approximately 10 ½ 
years, and has been his immediate supervisor for the past 4 years. He considers 
Applicant to be a dedicated, conscientious, and trustworthy individual.72 The site 
manager and the facility security representative both support Applicant’s application. 
They characterize him in glowing terms, using words such as integrity, honesty, 
trustworthiness, and responsibility.73

Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”74 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”75   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”76 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.77  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship

76 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”78 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”79 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(a), a “deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used 
to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities,” is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 16(b), “deliberately 
providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, 
investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government 
representative,” may raise security concerns. Applicant’s submission to DOHA of forged 
documents to support his contention that various accounts were no longer delinquent or 
never were delinquent, provided false and misleading information concerning critical 
78 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
79 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
12 
                                      
 
                                                          
relevant facts to DOHA’s personnel security specialist, as well as to me during 
Applicant’s hearing pertaining to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. His 
actions provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were deliberate 
falsifications or were the result of simple oversight or negligence on his part.  
 
As noted above, Applicant denied drafting, doctoring, forging, making up, or 
creating any of the aforementioned letters which he submitted to DOHA in response to 
the interrogatories. At the hearing, he claimed to have no idea why they would have 
been sent to him if they were not authentic. Yet, when he submitted them, he knew, or 
reasonably should have known, the actual state of his financial affairs. Many accounts 
were already delinquent and he was aware that his limited financial resources were 
insufficient to satisfy them all. With delinquent student loans approaching $100,000, it 
was unreasonable for him to assert there was no delinquency. Under the 
circumstances, I find his denials not to be credible. That is not to say that he actually 
drafted, doctored, forged, made up, or created the documents, for there is no direct 
evidence that he did so. However, he did use the documents with the presumed 
knowledge that the contents therein were false. I find Applicant’s explanations are 
incredible in his denial of deliberate falsification.80 AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) have been 
established. 
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct under AG ¶¶ 17(a)-(g). But in this instance, 
none of the mitigating conditions apply.  
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
80 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally 
permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case 
under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
explain the omission. 
 
13 
                                      
 
                                                          
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. 
Likewise, under AG ¶ 19(b), “indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible 
spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or 
establish a realistic plan to pay the debt,” may also be potentially disqualifying. Similarly, 
under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security 
concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, which 
may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-
to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying.  
 
As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2002, when he and his wife filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. In July 2003, $63,435 in unsecured debts were discharged, and his financial 
problems were eliminated. But not for long, for within a matter of a few years, various 
new accounts became delinquent. Despite promises to pay certain accounts, and 
claims to have paid others, with few exceptions, he has failed to keep his bills current. 
Accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection; some were charged off. 
And he continued to spend. Now there are additional delinquent non-SOR accounts. It 
appears that when his financial relationship with one cable company came to an 
impasse, he simply chose to move on to another such company, leaving the original 
provider with an unpaid account. (SOR ¶¶ 2.i., 2.q., and 2.s.) The same is true for his 
relationships with mobile telephone service. (SOR ¶¶ 2.e., 2.n., 2.o., and 2.w.) While he 
has submitted some documentation to support his contentions regarding payments 
supposedly made or accounts supposedly disputed, he has not done so for the 
remaining delinquent accounts. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@81 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
81 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
 
14 
                                      
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2002, were resolved by a Chapter 
7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts in 2003, and eventually re-emerged. Because the 
financial situation is frequent and continuing in nature, AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
Applicant’s handling of his finances, under the circumstances, does cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Likewise, Applicant receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(b), for Applicant has 
not documented evidence that the conditions that resulted in his financial problems at 
some point were largely beyond his control. He has noted certain family health issues, 
but has not explained how they interfered with his handling of his finances. Applicant 
failed to act responsibly under the circumstances. He failed to explain the 
circumstances regarding his financial problems between 2003 and the present. Rather 
than consolidating and minimizing expenses, except for dropping cable service, he 
continued to spend unwisely. He increased his expenditures and failed to reduce his 
delinquencies.82  
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has not received financial 
counseling and debt consolidation guidance, or if he has, he has not provided 
documentation to support any other conclusion. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant initiated a very limited good-
faith effort to repay several creditors, well before the SOR was issued. He made several 
payments in January, October, and November 2007, and again in March 2010, but 
except for those payments, ceased all such voluntary action. After years of ignoring his 
delinquent student loans, or making rare payments, the U.S. Department of Education 
garnished his wages and is now getting paid “involuntarily.” Over the years, Applicant 
did not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, 
he has taken no significant actions to address the satisfaction of those delinquent 
debts.83  
 
 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
82 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
 
83 The Appeal Board has previously held that “[A] applicant must do more than merely show that he or she 
relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim” he or she initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). 
 
15 
                                      
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because, while Applicant might have a legitimate 
reason to dispute the unknown account set forth in SOR ¶ 2.y., he has not provided 
“documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute.” 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Well after his 
finances got out of control, he initiated some belated good-faith efforts to pay some 
debts, well before the SOR was issued. For a brief period in 2007, he made some minor 
payments to some creditors. Thereafter, all of his efforts ceased, and did not resume 
until the day before the hearing. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a variety of creditors, but either 
had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued to accumulate 
delinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. In July 2003, $63,435 in unsecured 
debts were discharged in bankruptcy.  
 
Nevertheless, since his bankruptcy discharge, with the exceptions described 
above, Applicant did not make significant good-faith efforts to pay a variety of delinquent 
debts. While he ignored most of his creditors, he made a number of promises and 
claimed to have paid several creditors. Yet, there is insufficient or questionable 
documentation to support his contentions that he had fully, or partially, satisfied some of 
the creditors. Now, seven years after his debts were discharged under a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy order, he is again enmeshed in financial disarray. His long-standing failure 
to repay creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange payment plans, while 
creating new debts, reflects judgment traits which raise concerns about his fitness to 
hold a security clearance.  
 
 
16 
                                      
 
                                                          
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least 
under repayment arrangements; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns 
about his fitness to hold a security clearance. And there is the personal conduct 
surrounding the submission to DOHA of the forged documents. I am mindful that while 
any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history and personal 
conduct in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light 
of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.84 His insufficient good-faith efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments to 
his SOR creditors, and his inability to satisfactorily explain his submission of the forged 
documents, are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:85 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Although there are few positive signs in Applicant’s favor, such as his recent 
efforts to take corrective actions, and his maintenance of some of his payments of his 
daily living expenses, these steps are simply insufficient to show he can “live within [his] 
means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations.” See AG ¶ 18. Moreover, the 
personal conduct issues raise questions about his honesty and trustworthiness. Overall, 
the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal conduct 
and financial considerations.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
