RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
On January 7, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 
2006.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 22, 2010, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 
2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 17, 2010. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled on April 15, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9.

Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits 
(AE) A through T, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on April 23, 2010.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except ¶¶ 1.c, 1.m, and 1.n. 
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 41 years old. She was married from 1989 to 1995, and has a 19-
year-old child from the marriage. The child has lived with her father since 2001 and is 
now in college. Applicant also has two children, ages 13 and 14, from a prior 
relationship, who live with their father. Applicant has a high school education and has 
attended college, but did not earn a degree.1  
 
 Applicant was unemployed from November 2001 to February 2002. She was 
unemployed from February 2005 until sometime in 2006 (she could not recall the exact 
month). She stated she was homeless from March 2006 to June 2006. She was 
unemployed from May 2007 to July 2008, and again from March 2009 to June 2009. 
Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
on September 5, 2008. She stated she intended to pay her delinquent debts when she 
got a job.2  
 
 Applicant admitted that she owes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($755) for an electric bill 
owed since 2002. She was collecting unemployment benefits while living in an 
apartment and could not pay the bill. She could not afford to pay the bill even after she 
obtained employment. She sent a letter to the creditor on February 26, 2010, promising 
to pay $30 on the 16th of each month, beginning in April 2010. No payments had been 
made at the time of her hearing.3 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($424) is a medical debt. She incurred the debt in 2009 
and has not paid it. She intended to begin payments on April 16, 2010. Applicant 
provided documentation that she has paid many medical bills. She believes some of the 
medical bills did not belong to her. However, she acknowledged this one belongs to 
her.4

 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($215) was for telephones services delinquent for 
approximately a year and a half. It is paid.5 
 
 The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($946) and 1.e ($717) are student loans. Applicant 
incurred the debts in 2003. She stopped paying the debts when she was laid off from 
her job. She made a $1,300 payment in February 2009, and the amount alleged is the 
remainder owed. In 2006, the loans were deferred and she made reduced payments of 
$30 a month. She has not made any payments since June 2009, because she was 
unemployed and was paying other bills. She sent the creditor a letter and promised to 
pay $60 a month beginning on April 16, 2010. The debts remain unpaid.6 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,550) is for a car Applicant purchased in 2006. She was 
working, but not earning enough money to afford the payments. The car was 
repossessed after she missed two payments. She sent the creditor a letter promising to 
begin payments of $50 a month on April 16, 2010. The debt remains unpaid.7 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($643) is for a bank account that was closed and checks 
that had not cleared. She believes the amount owed is $462 since May 2007. She sent 
the creditor a letter promising to pay $75 a month beginning on April 16, 2010. The debt 
remains unpaid.8 
  
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($2,778) is owed to an apartment complex for unpaid rent. 
Applicant moved from the apartment in 2002 because she did not have a job and broke 
the lease. She began repaying the debt 2008. She made four payments of $115 since 
October 2008, the last one occurring on March 6, 2010. She provided a copy of an 
installment agreement dated March 12, 2010, with the creditor in which she agreed to 
pay $115 every ten days on the present balance of $2,432. The debt remains 
unresolved.9  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($6,073) is for child support arrearages. Applicant has not 
lived with the father of her two younger children since 2001. He had custody of the 
children. She had a verbal agreement with the father for child support. In 2006, he 
petitioned the court for support and was awarded child support of $274 a month and 
arrearages. The state child support division garnished Applicant’s wages for a period of 
time. Her wages are not presently being garnished. The child support amount was 
never reduced when she was unemployed. She currently pays $68 for the arrearages 
owed. She does not have a current child support order and she only pays the arrearage. 
Applicant explained that she and the father of her two younger children have another

verbal agreement. She provides clothes for the children twice a year as a means of 
support. She stated the only support order she has is one for arrearages, of which the 
current balance is $5,560.10  
 
 The judgment in SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,790) is for damages for a car accident that 
occurred in May 2004. Applicant did not have car insurance. She caused the accident 
and went to the victim’s house and gave him a check for $600 for the damages. On her 
security clearance application (SCA), she stated the victim cashed the check and she 
did not know why there was a judgment against her.11 She admitted the police 
investigated the accident and she was cited and fined for not having insurance. In her 
OPM interview, she stated the victim gave her an estimate of the damages as $1,800 
and she gave him a check for that amount. She said the check was cashed. She has 
attempted to get a copy of the check, but has been unsuccessful. She never received a 
summons. The judgment has not been paid and she intended to begin payments on 
April 16, 2010.12  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($691) is for a bank account that was closed in 2007, on 
which Applicant had an outstanding balance. Applicant intended to begin paying $75 a 
month on the account beginning on April 16, 2010. Applicant stated that her identity was 
stolen and this could be a result of that. She did not question the bank regarding the 
validity of the debt.13 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($4,689) is for a hospital bill from 2008. Applicant did not 
have health insurance. She spoke to the creditor and promised to pay $50 a month 
beginning on April 16, 2010. She made one payment of $50 on March 6, 2010.14 
 
 Applicant denied the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.m ($3,010) in her answer to the SOR, 
stating she did not know what the account was about and it was “the first I heard of this 
account.” At her hearing, Applicant acknowledged that the creditor is a private school 
where her oldest child attended in 1994. She explained she was never notified of the 
judgment. She has not contacted the creditor, but plans to do so in the future and make 
payment arrangements.15 
 
 Applicant denied that she was arrested in 1998 for issuing bad checks under 
$200. She stated she was not found guilty of this offense. She believed someone was 
using her identity and wrote a check. She recalled that she had a check returned from a

store and she went to the store and paid the check. She contacted the county to inquire 
if she had a criminal record and her record was clean.16  
 
 Applicant admitted that she and her husband filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 
1995 and had their debts discharged. She attributed her financial problems at that time 
to her youth.17  
 
 Applicant explained that she will make payments on many of her debts on April 
16, 2010, because that is the day she gets paid. She confirmed that she filed her 2009 
federal income tax returns. She owes $1,400. She set up a payment plan of $100 a 
month to pay the amount. She acknowledged that she is accountable for all of her 
debts.18 
 
 Applicant has no money in a savings or a checking account. She does not have 
any investment or retirement accounts. She has a monthly budget that she prepares 
each month showing what bills she intends to pay. She has been sending her 19–year-
old daughter about $300-$400 a month since June 2009 to help with college 
expenses.19 
 
 Applicant provided a written statement that says she believed some of the bills 
on her credit report did not belong to her. She notified all three credit bureaus and 
requested an identity theft notice on her accounts. She stated that she paid bills she did 
not believe belonged to her because of her security clearance issues.20  
 
 Applicant provided a reference letter from a manager. The manager described 
Applicant as a responsible employee who consistently exceeded expectations in the 
performance of her job duties.21  
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are considered in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

19 Tr. 53, 79-80, 82, 91.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
7 
 
 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Appellant has a history of being unwilling or unable to meet her financial 
obligations since 2002. She has debts that remain unpaid and delinquent. I find there is 
sufficient evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating 
conditions under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s behavior is recent because her delinquent debts remain unpaid. She 
paid one debt, made inconsistent or sporadic payments on others, and promised to 
institute payments on many in the future. At this point, it is too early to conclude that her 
 
8 
 
 
financial problems are unlikely to recur. I find mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a) does not 
apply. 
 
 Applicant experienced extended periods of unemployment that drastically 
affected her ability to pay her debts. Her unemployment was outside of her control 
raising the application of AG ¶ 20(b). In order for that mitigating condition to be fully 
applicable, Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. In this 
case, Applicant made some effort to make payments on some of her delinquent debts, 
but in general, she has only promised to make payments in the future and has not yet 
established a consistent record of making the promised payments. She agreed to make 
monthly payments of $115 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h and provided documentary proof of 
four payments made since October 2008, which reflects an inability to comply with the 
terms of the agreement. At this time, I am uncertain that she is willing and able to 
consistently make all the payments she has promised to numerous creditors. I find AG ¶ 
20(b) only partially applies.  
 
 There is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling. She stated she 
prepares a budget each month. She has paid one debt, made sporadic payments on a 
few others, and promised to begin paying others in the future. She has approximately 
$23,000 in delinquent debts that remain unpaid. She also has a payment plan with the 
Internal Revenue Service to pay her 2009 taxes. There are not clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are being resolved or under control. Applicant has not 
initiated good-faith payments with her creditors to resolve her debts. She agreed to 
make monthly payments, but without a detailed budget and proof of consistent monthly 
payments, it is uncertain whether she will be able to fulfill her agreements. At this 
juncture, it is too early to conclude that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
I find AG 20 ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant disputed that certain debts were 
valid or belonged to her. However, she did not provide documented proof for the basis 
of her dispute or any action she took to resolve the issues. Therefore, I find AG ¶ 20(e) 
does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
9 
 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a high school graduate. 
She and her former husband had their debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1995. 
Applicant experienced extended periods of unemployment. She has approximately 
$23,000 in delinquent debts. She made promises to begin making monthly payments on 
most of her debts, but at the time of the hearing she had not started the payments. 
Applicant does not have a realistic formulated financial plan for resolving her delinquent 
debts. Applicant needs time to resolve them, formulate a reasonable repayment plan, 
and establish an extended record of fiscal responsibility. At this time, the record 
evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability 
for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising under the Financial Considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph   1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.d-1.m:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph   1.n:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.o:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
