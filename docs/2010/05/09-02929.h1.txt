ANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: 
 
 After a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I 
conclude that Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government’s security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and the whole-person analysis. His 
eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Applicant executed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on 
November 20, 2008. On January 29, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
2 
 
 
 On February 27, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 
2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 25, 2010, and I convened a hearing, 
as scheduled, on April 19, 2010, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
Government called no witnesses and introduced 14 exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 
through 14. The Government withdrew Ex. 14, which duplicated documents that 
Applicant included with his Answer to the SOR. The Government’s remaining exhibits, 
with the exception of Ex. 8, were then admitted to the record without objection. 
Applicant objected to Ex. 8 because he believed it identified a debt that was not his but 
that of his deceased parents. At the conclusion of the evidence, I admitted Ex. 8 to the 
record. The Government conceded that it could not establish that Applicant was 
responsible for the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.m. and further identified at Ex. 8. The 
Government also provided one demonstrative exhibit which I marked as Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 1. Applicant did not object to HE 1, and it was admitted into evidence. 
 
Applicant called no witnesses, but testified on his own behalf. He introduced 33 
exhibits, which were marked as follows: Exs. A, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, 
D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-9, D-10, D-11, D-12, D-13, E-1, E-2, F, G, H, 
I-1, I-2, J-1, J-2, J-3, J-4. Applicant’s exhibits were admitted without objection. At the 
conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one calendar week, until April 26, 
2010, so that Applicant could provide additional documentation. On April 26, 2010, 
Applicant, through counsel, requested that the record remain open for an additional 48-
hour period so that he could supplement the record. However, before filing any post-
hearing documents, Applicant filed his intent to withdraw from the adjudication of his 
security clearance eligibility. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on April 
27, 2010. 
 
Applicant’s Motion to Withdraw His Request for a Security Clearance 
 
On April 26, 2010, Applicant forwarded to me an e-mail communication which he 
had sent to his counsel on April 22, 2010. The communication read, in pertinent part, as 
follows: “I [name] have decided to withdraw my application [for] eligibility for a security 
clearance.” On Tuesday morning, April 27, 2010, I forwarded Applicant’s e-mail to his 
counsel and to Department Counsel and requested that they participate in a telephone 
conference with me to discuss Applicant’s request. The parties agreed to a telephone 
conference at 4:30 pm that day. At 4:30 pm, Applicant’s counsel sent the following e-
mail communication to Applicant, Department Counsel, and to me:  
 
Per [Applicant’s] email to DOHA below, he has decided to withdraw his 
application for a security clearance in this case. Hence he is withdrawing 
his DOHA appeal. Consequently, we hereby withdraw our notice of 
appearance in this case. 
 
 At 4:44 pm Department Counsel sent the following e-mail communication to 
Applicant, his counsel, and to me: 
 
3 
 
 
For the Record in This Case:  
 
I have just attempted to call [Applicant’s counsel] to discuss [Applicant’s e-
mail request to withdraw]. [Applicant’s counsel] refused the phone call as 
he has withdrawn his appearance in this case. 
 
The Government’s position for the conference call was to be the following: 
[Applicant] currently has a Top Secret clearance. As such, he cannot 
withdraw his application for a clearance because he is not applying for a 
clearance. Rather, the Government is revoking his current, active 
clearance. In addition, under DoD Directive 5220.6, paragraph 4.4.1. this 
process cannot be stopped once a hearing has commenced, as in this 
case. 
 
 Section 4 of DoD Directive 5220.6 defines the policy which guides security 
clearance proceedings. Subsections 4.4 and 4.4.1 of Section 4 state: “Actions pursuant 
to this Directive shall cease upon termination of the applicant’s need for access to 
classified information except in those cases in which . . . [a] hearing has commenced.”  
 
At 4:56 pm on April 27, 2010, I notified the parties by e-mail that Applicant could 
not, under the Directive, withdraw from the adjudication of his security clearance 
eligibility. I further advised them that after the record closed and I received the hearing 
transcript, I would carefully review all matters in the record and issue a written decision 
in this case. The e-mail communications among Applicant, his counsel, Department 
Counsel, and me are entered in the record as HE 2.     
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR contains 16 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial 
Considerations.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.p.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted 13 allegations and denied three allegations. Applicant’s admissions are 
entered as findings of fact.  (SOR; Answer to SOR.)  
 
 Applicant, who is 55 years old, has held a security clearance for 15 years and is 
employed as a senior engineer by a government contractor. He is a college graduate 
and holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration. He has been married for 28 
years. He and his wife are the parents of two adult sons. Their younger son, who suffers 
from epilepsy, is a college student, and their older son is a teacher. Both sons still live at 
home. The older son suffers from bi-polar disorder. (Ex. 1; Tr. 41, 46-47,112-113.) 
 
 Applicant and his wife purchased their home in 1995. They refinanced their 
mortgage in 2001 or 2002. The current loan balance of Applicant’s home mortgage is 
$405,000. Since 2002 or 2003, his mortgage payments have been $3,400 a month. 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.; Tr. 157-158.) 
 During his career, Applicant has worked for several different federal contractors. 
In 2001 and 2002, he was employed as an independent contractor and, as such, was 
 
4 
 
 
                                           
responsible for paying his own income and social security taxes. During that period of 
employment, Applicant did not pay the required federal and state taxes. In 2003, he 
purchased a truck, and in 2004 and 2005, he claimed certain expenses related to the 
truck as deductions on his federal income tax returns. In 2005, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) began an audit of his income tax returns, eventually auditing his returns 
from 2001 through 2006. In 2006, to recoup some of the taxes that Applicant owed, the 
IRS garnished his wages for approximately one year.1 (Ex. D-6, D-7, D-8; Tr.117-123.) 
 
 After the garnishment of his wages ceased, Applicant made some small 
payments to the IRS. In 2006, the IRS levied four federal tax liens against Applicant, 
and, in 2007, the IRS levied a fifth lien against him. The tax liens are alleged in the SOR 
as follows: ¶ 1.d. ($16,655); ¶ 1.e. ($56,747)2; ¶1.n. ($44,671); ¶ 1.o. ($17,924); and  ¶ 
1.p. ($13,555). Applicant hired a law firm to represent him before the IRS, but he 
concluded that the law firm was not helping him and he undertook direct negotiations 
with the IRS over the payment of his several liens. In September 2009, Applicant’s wife 
withdrew over $56,000 from her 401(k) plan and Applicant withdrew approximately 
$4,000 from his retirement account and they remitted these funds to the IRS in 
satisfaction of the lien alleged at SOR ¶ 1.e. They also entered an agreement to pay the 
IRS $2,500 each month on the remaining lien indebtedness. They made their first 
payment under the agreement in October or November 2009. Applicant estimated that 
he had made “six or seven” of the $2,500 monthly payments, and he estimated that he 
would satisfy his federal tax debt in about three and one-half years. He indicated he 
would provide documentation after the conclusion of his hearing to establish the number 
of monthly payments he had made, but he failed to do so. (SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 9; Ex. 10; 
Ex. 11; Ex. 12; Ex. A; Ex. D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4; Tr. 75-79, 82-83, 103-104, 124-128.)     
 
 Applicant also owed delinquent taxes to his state of residence. In 2007, 2008, 
and 2009, the state filed four liens against Applicant. The liens reflected unpaid state 
taxes for tax years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. These state tax liens are alleged in the 
SOR as follows: ¶ 1.a. ($21,456); ¶ 1.b. ($4,519); ¶ 1.c. ($4,746); and ¶ 1.l. ($1.344). 
Applicant contacted the state tax authority in the fall of 2009 and verbally agreed to pay 
$350 a month to pay off the liens. He estimated that he would satisfy the four state tax 
liens in about two years. He provided the following documentation to corroborate 
payment on the state tax liens: a photocopy of a cashier’s check for $1,200, payable to 
the State; a photocopy of a money order receipt for $144, showing payment to the State 
comptroller; photocopies of the faces of five personal checks, each made out to the 
State comptroller or to the State for $350 and signed by Applicant or his wife.3  (SOR; 
Ex. 2; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Ex. 7; Exs. C-1 to Ex. C-5; Tr. 73-74, 103-104, 130-132.) 
 
 
1 Applicant testified that the IRS garnished approximately $10,000 from his wages during 2006. (Tr. 77.) 
 
2 Ex. 6 establishes that this lien was released in January 2010. (Ex. 6.) 
 
3 Two checks were dated November 4, 2009. The remaining three checks were dated December 1, 2009, 
February 7, 2010, and March 20, 2010. Applicant stated he would provide photocopies of the backs of the 
personal checks as post-hearing documents, but he failed to do so. (Ex. C-1 to Ex. C-5; Tr. 64-67.) 
 
5 
 
 
 The SOR alleged that Applicant was delinquent on several consumer debts. He 
admitted he owed the $2,180 line of credit debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.f. He stated that he 
had a payment plan in place and paid the creditor $220 a month. He provided 
photocopies of the faces of three personal checks, made out to the creditor for $220 
and dated November 22, 2009, December 28, 2009, and January 26, 2010. He also 
presented a photocopy of the face of a personal check, made out to the creditor for 
$450 and dated March 30, 2010. Applicant acknowledged that he was not current on 
the debt, and he was not sure how much he still owed the creditor. (Ex. 2; Ex. 12; Ex. 
Exs. E-1 and E-2; Tr. 83-84, 134-135.) 
 
 Applicant denied a $292 debt, alleged at SOR ¶ 1.g. However, at his hearing, he 
offered a photocopy of the face of a personal check for $292, made out to the creditor 
identified in SOR ¶ 1.g. The check was dated April 10, 2010. He provided no other 
receipt or proof of payment. (Ex. 12; Ex. F; Tr. 85-86.)  
 
 Applicant admitted a $56 debt, alleged at SOR ¶ 1.h. As proof of payment, he 
offered a photocopy of the face of a personal check for $56, made out to the creditor 
identified in SOR ¶ 1.h. and dated April 1, 2010. (Ex. 2; Ex. 12; Ex. G; Tr. 66-89.) 
 
 Applicant denied a $255 debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.i. At his hearing, he provided a 
photocopy of the face of a personal check for $255, made out to the creditor identified in 
SOR ¶ 1.i. and dated April 12, 2010. Applicant acknowledged that he had sent the 
check without contacting the creditor to verify the current amount due. (Ex. 2; Ex. 12; 
Ex. H; Tr. 136-137.) 
 
 Applicant admitted a delinquent debt owed to the creditor from whom he 
purchased a 2001 Mercedes for his wife in 2004. The purchase price of the car was 
about $13,000, and the monthly payments on the vehicle were $764. Applicant provided  
a receipt showing he had wired $1,655.06 to the creditor on March 20, 2010. He 
asserted that the amount he sent to the creditor satisfied the debt in full. He failed to 
provide documentation to corroborate his assertion. (Ex. 2; Ex. I-1; Ex. I-2; Tr. 92-93, 
137-139.)   
 
  The SOR alleged at ¶ 1.k. that Applicant was past due on his mortgage payment 
and owed the creditor $3,410. Applicant acknowledged that he fell behind in paying his 
mortgage in December 2009, and he was attempting to negotiate a lower rate with his 
lender. He stated he was current on his mortgage and would provide documentation to 
show that he was current. However, he failed to do so. (Ex. 2; Ex. 12; Tr. 94, 103,139-
141.) 
 The SOR alleged at ¶ 1.m. that Applicant owed approximately $1,044 on an 
unsatisfied judgment filed against him in 2006 in another State. Applicant denied that 
the judgment applied to him, and he noted that his parents’ names, and not his, were on 
the judgment, which had been levied against his parents, who are deceased. The 
Government conceded that it could not establish that Applicant was responsible for the 
judgment.  (Ex. 8; Tr. 97-98, 109-111.) 
 
 
6 
 
 
                                           
 Since 2006, Applicant has held down two full-time jobs, one during the day, and 
the other at night, in order to pay his debts. In 2008, he was stricken with colon cancer 
and was out of work for about two months. He described his current work situation as 
exhausting and his current financial situation as “like a nightmare.” (Tr. 58-59, 106, 108-
109.) 
 
 In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided two personal financial 
statements for the record. The first financial statement, dated September 26, 2009, 
reported a total net monthly income of $12,498 and monthly expenses of $5,060.40. On 
the statement, Applicant listed two financial obligations: his home mortgage and his 
wife’s and son’s student loans. He reported that his monthly mortgage payment was 
$3,407 and his monthly payment on his wife’s and son’s student loans was $525, for a 
total of $3,932. He reported a net monthly remainder of $3,506. His financial statement 
did not include his monthly payment of $2,500 to the IRS, his $350 monthly payment to 
the state taxing authority, or his $220 monthly payment on his line of credit debt. (Ex. 12 
at 15.) 
 
 On October 2, 2009, Applicant provided a second personal financial statement, 
which the record indicated he signed on August 12, 2009. At his hearing, Applicant 
reviewed the statement he provided on October 2, 2009, and confirmed the accuracy of 
a net monthly income of $12,459 as reported on the second statement. He was less 
clear about details of his living expenses and other financial obligations. He stated that 
his wife had completed the financial statements and paid the family’s monthly bills. He 
confirmed that he and his wife had a net monthly income of $12,459. On his October 
2009 personal financial statement, Applicant reported total monthly expenses of $6,148, 
itemized as follows: food, $700; clothing, $350; utilities, $1,200; car expenses, $2,7064; 
life and other insurance, $180; medical expenses, $836; and miscellaneous, $172. The 
second statement listed two debts: Applicant’s monthly mortgage of $3,407 and a 
monthly payment on his wife’s student loan debt of $215. He confirmed that he was not 
paying his son’s student loan debt. He reported on the second statement that his net 
remainder each month was $2,423. His financial statement did not include his monthly 
payment of $2,500 to the IRS, his $350 monthly payment to the State taxing authority, 
or his $220 monthly payment on his line of credit debt. Applicant has not had financial 
credit counseling.  He has no money in his savings account. He reported $16,000 in his 
retirement account (Ex. 13 at 3; Tr. 146-155.)   
 
  Applicant has been active in his community as a volunteer coach and youth 
leader. He has used some of his own money to purchase equipment and supplies for 
the youth groups he has mentored. Three individuals who worked with him in his 
community activities provided letters of character reference for Applicant. All three 
 
4 Applicant testified that he had paid off his wife’s automobile debt and no longer makes payments of 
$764 a month on her vehicle. He pays $450 a month on his car note; $420 a month on his younger son’s 
car note; and approximately $400 on his second son’s car note.  Applicant did not know how much he 
pays each month for automobile insurance, and he also did not know how much he spends on 
maintaining his family’s automobiles. (Tr. 149-150.)

references praised Applicant’s character, generosity, and dedication. (Ex. B-1; Ex. B-2, 
Ex. B-3; Tr. 48-49.)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and 
it has emphasized that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the 
Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, an   
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
 
8 
 
 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
Applicant and his wife paid $56,000 to the IRS in September 2009, thus 
satisfying the federal tax lien alleged at SOR ¶ 1.e. Additionally, the record did not 
establish that Applicant was responsible for the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.m.  
Accordingly, the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.m. are concluded for Applicant. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise financial considerations 
security concerns in this case. Under AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting 
financial obligations@ may raise security concerns. Applicant failed to pay his federal and 
state income taxes in 2001 and 2002. In 2004 and 2005, he claimed tax deductions on 
a truck that were disallowed. As a result, he accumulated substantial delinquent tax 
debt, interest, and penalties which he did not address until recently. Moreover, his 
current budget suggests confusion and uncertainty about how much his family spends 
each month and how much remains available after paying his fixed expenses to satisfy 
his tax debts and the debts alleged in the SOR. This evidence is sufficient to raise these 
potentially disqualifying conditions. 
 
 
9 
 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions 
could apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant’s financial delinquencies. 
Unresolved financial difficulties might be mitigated if they “happened so long ago, w[ere] 
so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that [they] are unlikely to recur and 
[do] not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” (AG ¶ 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be 
mitigated if “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person’s control, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” (AG ¶ 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might 
be applicable include evidence that “the person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or 
is under control” (AG ¶ 20(c)) or “the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” (AG ¶ 20(d))  Finally, if “the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of options to resolve the issue,” then AG ¶ 20(e) might apply.  
 
Applicant’s financial difficulties date at least to 2001, when he was employed as 
an independent contractor and did not pay his federal and state income taxes. His 
wages were garnished for approximately one year in 2006 by the IRS. He then obtained 
a second full-time job in order to earn enough money to pay his tax debts. However, his 
personal financial statements of September 26, 2009 and October 2, 2009 do not reflect 
any payments to federal or State taxing authorities. 
 
 In 2008, Applicant was stricken with colon cancer and missed about two months 
of work, a situation that was beyond his control. However, his serious tax debts arose 
before he contracted colon cancer. His substantial indebtedness continues to the 
present time. 
 
Applicant holds down two full-time jobs, a situation that causes him fatigue and 
stress. Despite a high combined income from his two jobs, he was unaware of how his 
money was spent. While he has a payment plan in place with the IRS and a verbal 
payment arrangement with his state taxing authority and hopes to pay his tax debts in 
the future, his current financial situation casts doubt on his ability to plan realistically for 
the future. Moreover, Applicant has not received financial counseling, and it is not clear 
at this time that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. Although 
he has known of his substantial tax debts since at least 2006, he provided 
documentation at his hearing that showed he did not take action to pay or resolve his 
tax delinquencies and other debts alleged on the SOR until the latter part of 2009 and 
the first four months of 2010. Although he deserves credit for satisfying his $56,000 tax 
lien, he failed to establish that he has carried out other good-faith efforts to repay his 
overdue creditors or to otherwise resolve his debts.

While Applicant admitted many of his financial delinquencies, it was not clear that 
he understood his financial problems or how to resolve them. While he has plans to pay 
his federal and state tax delinquencies in the future, his month-to-month financial 
situation remains precarious: he has no plan in place to systematically resolve his 
substantial delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that while 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part to Applicant’s case, AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do 
not apply to the facts of his case.5 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.         
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult 
of 55 years. He is respected and appreciated for his ability to mentor youth and for his 
helpfulness and generosity to others. He has suffered a serious physical illness beyond 
his control. He has been holding down two full-time jobs in an attempt to acquire 
enough money to pay his tax delinquencies. However, he remains financially 
overextended, and his October 2009 financial statement suggests that he lacks 
sufficient funds to meet his monthly expenses and pay his debts. Applicant’s current 
financial situation raises concerns about his judgment and potential financial 
vulnerability. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude, 
after a careful review of the facts of his case, the financial considerations adjudicative 
guideline, and the whole-person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial delinquencies. 
 
5 AG ¶ 20(f) does not apply in this case.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST  APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. - 1.d.:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.e.:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.f. - 1.l.:  Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.m.:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.n.: - 1.p.:  Against Applicant 
 
                                     Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
