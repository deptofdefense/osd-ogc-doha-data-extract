Decision

GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 24, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing version of a Security 
Clearance Application (e-QIP).1 On June 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his financial 
situation. He responded to the interrogatories on July 15, 2009.2 On November 3, 2009, 
DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP), dated February 24, 2009.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2009).

modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access 
to Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 9, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, notarized on November 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 31, 2009, 
and the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran on January 
12, 2010. It was reassigned to me on February 12, 2010, due to caseload 
considerations. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 12, 2010, and I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on March 30, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, seven Government exhibits were admitted into evidence, 
without objection. Although Applicant did not submit any exhibits, it was noted that he 
had attached a number of documents to his Answer to the SOR, and those documents 
were considered, though not given specific exhibit designations. Applicant testified. The 
record remained open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on April 
12, 2010, he submitted three additional exhibits that were also admitted into evidence, 
without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 7, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted (many with explanations) all of the 
factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.r.) of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a supply technician,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He had 
previously been granted a security clearance in August 1989.4 He served on active duty 
with the U.S. Army from May 1975 until June 1995, when he retired with an honorable 
discharge.5 Following his retirement, Applicant was employed by a number of 
employers in a variety of positions, including correctional officer, warehouse manager, 
senior buyer, facilities support manager, parts specialist, senior food buyer, and senior 
field buyer. He also went through periodic periods of unemployment, sometimes as few

as 20 days, and once as long as 11 months.6 He has been with his current employer 
since February 2009.7 
 
Applicant has been married since January 1978.8 He and his wife have two 
children, born in 1979 and 1986, respectively.9 His son is currently on active duty with 
the U.S. Navy.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1996. At some 
point prior to April 1996, Applicant’s consumer debt reached a certain level, and he and 
his wife decided to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.11 
On March 31, 1997, the petition was amended and converted to Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code.12 An unspecified amount of consumer debt was discharged on July 
28, 1997.13  
 
On March 3, 2000, Applicant and his wife again filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.14 The petition was dismissed on April 12, 
2000,15 refiled on April 19, 2000,16 and eventually dismissed on January 9, 2002.17  
 
Because of his failure to pay income tax, two tax liens were placed against his 
residence in October 1997 (a non-SOR lien - $1,588) and December 1998 (SOR ¶ 1.a. -
$281), respectively.18 Applicant contends he paid the December 1998 lien but could not

recall the details surrounding the payments.19 During the hearing, he contended he had 
paid off the lien20 and would submit evidence to support his contention.21 No such 
submission was made. 
 
Despite the presence of financial issues from 1996 through 2002, according to 
Applicant, his financial difficulties did not occur until about March 2008:22  
 
In 2007 I was employed overseas and made my payments in a timely 
manner. Upon my return to the United States in March of 2008 expecting 
to find top quality employment with my new experience, I was quickly 
plagued with the status of the U.S. Economy/job market. I was 
unemployed for 11 months. I struggled for months to make my mortgage 
and credit card payments, and was also hit with expenses that I did not 
expect (death of a granddaughter, care for my daughter’s illness/emotional 
state, home repair expenses, etc.). 
 
In November 2009, he added: “All my financial problems were mainly caused by 
problems beyond my control, unexplained, and untimely loss of employment.”23  
 
In addition to the allegations pertaining to Applicant’s 1998 lien and the two 
(alleged in the SOR as three) bankruptcies, the SOR identified 14 purportedly 
continuing delinquencies as reflected by four credit reports from 2009,24 totaling 
approximately $20,743. Some accounts have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to 
other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the 
credit reports, in many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the 
same creditor or collection agent name, or under a different creditor or collection agent 
name. Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are 
identified by partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits 
and in others eliminating other digits. Those debts listed in the SOR, all of which 
Applicant admitted, and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, 
documents submitted by Applicant, and Applicant’s written and testimonial comments 
relative thereto, are described below:

25 Applicant’s Answer to SOR, supra note 11 (Proposed Modification Agreement, dated September 15, 
2009). In March 2009, Applicant stated that once he was placed under a federal hardship payment plan, his monthly 
payment was reduced to $850. Government Exhibit 2, supra note 18, at 5. During the hearing he testified his monthly 
payment was $937, “off the top of [his] head,” and the account was current. Tr. at 22-23. However, Applicant Exhibit 
C (Chapter 13 Plan and Application for Payment of Administrative Expenses, filed April 2, 2010), at 3, states the 
mortgage payment is $963. Additionally, it was estimated that the remaining arrearage is $1,926, indicating the 
delinquency has not been eliminated.

On March 12, 2009, Applicant entered into an agreement with a for-profit credit 
counselor, under which he made a non-refundable one-time payment of $383, and 
continuing monthly payments of $69, to assist him by furnishing financial analysis, 
guidance, and debt resolution services. In addition, effective April 6, 2009, he started 
making monthly payments to a debt pool of creditors, through his credit counselor, of 
$343.45 Although the relationship was originally anticipated to continue for 30 months, 
Applicant subsequently determined that the relationship was not beneficial to him, and 
he terminated it after about two months.46 On November 3, 2009, he completed on on-
line credit counseling briefing.47

During 2007-2008, when Applicant was working overseas in the war zone, he 
earned $105,000 per year, of which the first 88 per cent was not taxed.48 He applied 
some of his salary and savings to other debts.49 While he was unemployed, he 
collected an unspecified amount of unemployment compens 50
 
On July 15, 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating 
monthly net income of $7,273, including $1,300 military retirement and $710 for his 
wife’s disability income,51 monthly expenses of $870, scheduled monthly debt payments 
of $1,345, and a net remainder of $3,058 available for discretionary spending.52 Among 
his listed assets were three vehicles with an estimated value of $30,000.  
 
Not listed among the delinquent accounts in the SOR are a number of student 
loans, in the amount of about $44,000, which are currently in a deferred status, which 
Applicant intends to include in his bankruptcy.53 In addition, in about September 2009, 
Applicant’s wages were garnished, based on an earlier judgment for $7,000, and $700 
was removed from his salary each month.54 While the name of the collection agency is 
known, the identity of the original creditor or the specific account, is unknown. He no 
longer has any current credit cards.55 
 
On April 2, 2010, Applicant and his wife filed a joint Voluntary Petition for 
Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.56 The anticipated total of 
plan payments is $87,000, including $6,000 to the county treasurer’s office for taxes and 
“certain other debts.”57 He filed his petition because he assumes full responsibility for 
his debts and “. . . I’ve never tried to avoid my debts and I do intend to pay each one of 
them as quick as possible and move on with my life.”58

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”59 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”60   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”61 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.62  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship

and modified.    
 
61 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”63 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”64 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying. As 
noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1996, 
when he and his wife filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 or the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. The petition was amended and converted to Chapter 7. An unspecified amount of 
unsecured debt was discharged in July 1997, and his financial problems were

eliminated. But not for long, for in March 2000, they again filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13, and subsequently refiled it again in April 2000. It was eventually dismissed 
in January 2002. Two tax liens were filed against his residence. Despite promises to 
pay certain accounts, and claims to have paid others, with few exceptions, he has failed 
to keep his bills current. Accounts became delinquent and sent for collection, some 
were charged off, and he was successfully sued on others. And he continued to spend, 
purchasing furniture, acquiring a gym membership with a personal trainer, and having 
three motor vehicles. Events occurred after the issuance of the SOR and now there are 
additional delinquent non-SOR accounts. While he has submitted some documentation 
to support his contentions regarding payments supposedly made or accounts 
supposedly disputed (SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.h., 1.k., and 1.m.), he has not done so 
for the remaining delinquent accounts. Applicant and his wife intend to file for joint 
bankruptcy and seek discharge of his financial delinquencies. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 
19(e) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@65 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 1996, were resolved by Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge of his debts in 1997, and eventually re-emerged. He has 
65 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

attributed his financial difficulties to his 2008 11-month period of unemployment, the 
loss of a granddaughter, and his daughter’s health issues; however, these 
circumstances were not the primary cause of his financial problems. He earned a 
substantial salary, mostly tax free, during 2007-2008, and should have been able to 
resolve his long-standing delinquent debts, but was unable to do so. Because the 
financial situation is frequent and continuing in nature, despite having initially 
commenced in 1996, as opposed to 2008, he receives minimal application of AG ¶ 
20(a). Applicant’s handling of his finances, under the circumstances, does cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Likewise, he receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while the conditions 
that resulted in the financial problem at some point were largely initially beyond 
Applicant’s control (e.g., loss of his employment, his granddaughter’s death, and 
daughter’s unexpected medical problems), Applicant failed to act responsibly under the 
circumstances. He failed to explain the circumstances regarding his financial problems 
between 1997 and 2008. Furthermore, while unemployed for 11 months, Applicant 
continued to receive his military retirement and unemployment compensation. And, 
rather than consolidating and minimizing expenses, he continued to spend unwisely, 
purchasing new furniture, joining a gym and securing the services of a personal trainer. 
He increased his expenditures and failed to reduce his delinquencies.66  
 
AG & 20(c) applies because Applicant has received financial counseling and debt 
consolidation guidance from a for-profit credit counselor in March 2009, and 
subsequently completed an on-line credit counseling briefing. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay several creditors, well before the SOR was issued. Unfortunately, his relationship 
with the for-profit credit counselor did not continue and over a period of several months, 
Applicant made no further efforts to address his debts. He made several minor 
payments in September and October 2009, but in anticipation of his bankruptcy filing, 
ceased all such voluntary action. He arranged for a modification of his delinquent 
mortgage, and contended that he had brought it to a current status, but in reality, $1,926 
remains delinquent. Over the years, Applicant did not act aggressively, timely, or 
responsibly to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. Instead, he declared his 
intentions to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Applicant has been down this path several times in the past, and while there is some 
positive action, since 2002, when his last Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed, it 
appears he has taken no significant actions to address the satisfaction of his delinquent 
debts.67  
66 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
 
67 The Appeal Board has previously held that “[A] applicant must do more than merely show that he or she 
relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim” he or she initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004).

AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because, while he might have a legitimate reason to 
dispute the unknown account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.j., he has not provided “documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute.” 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When these 
problems mushroomed with his unemployment, his finances continued to go steadily 
down hill and out of control. He initiated some good-faith efforts to pay a tax lien and 
apply for a mortgage home loan modification agreement, well before the SOR was 
issued. And for a brief period, he made some minor payments to some creditors either 
by himself or with the assistance of the for-profit credit counselor. And then, all his 
efforts ceased while he awaited his anticipated filing for bankruptcy. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the unemployment and reduced earnings were, at times, circumstances beyond 
his control, Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a variety of creditors, 
but either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued to 
accumulate delinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. Even while unemployed, 
Applicant continued to receive his military retirement and unemployment compensation. 
While he was serving overseas he made a good salary that was largely untaxed, and he 
has been employed since February 2009. Nevertheless, since that time, with the 
exceptions described above, he did not make significant good-faith efforts to pay a 
variety of delinquent debts. He established one repayment plan through the mortgage 
loan modification agreement, and actually made some small payments to a few 
creditors. But, he ignored the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.c., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i., 1.j., 1.l., 1.n., and 
1.o.  Instead, he made a number of promises and claimed to have paid several 
creditors. Yet, there is no documentation to support his contentions that he had fully

satisfied some of the creditors (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.k.). Now, 13 years after his debts 
were discharged under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and 8 years after his last Chapter 13 
bankruptcy was dismissed, he is again applying for relief under Chapter 13 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. His long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable 
amounts, or to arrange payment plans, while creating new debts, reflects traits which 
raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Of course, the issue is not 
simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least under repayment arrangements.  
 
I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put 
Applicant’s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of 
this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.68 His insufficient good-faith efforts or evidence to reflect actual 
payments to his SOR creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:69 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Although there are some positive signs, such as efforts to take corrective actions, 
and maintenance of some of his payments on his daily living expenses, these steps are 
simply insufficient to show he can “live within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations.” See AG ¶ 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
68 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

  Subparagraph 1.k:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o:    Against Applicant

  Subparagraph 1.q:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.r:    Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
