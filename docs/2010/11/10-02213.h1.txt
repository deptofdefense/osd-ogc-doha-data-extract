GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance or access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 9, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On May 10, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
1 Item 4 (SF 86), dated September 9, 2009. 
 
2 
                                      
 
                                                          
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 17, 2010. In a sworn, written 
statement, dated May 24, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on June 8, 2010, 
and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the 
FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant received the FORM on June 16, 2010, and submitted a letter with 
attachments to Department Counsel on an unspecified date before July 20, 2010.2 The 
case was assigned to me on August 4, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in ¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.x. of the SOR.  
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a human resources/security representative.3 While on active duty with the U.S. Army 
from 1979 until 1982, she was granted a TOP SECRET security clearance in 1980.4 
She was married in 1983 and divorced in 1991.5 She has one daughter, born in 1982.6 
From 1999 until August 2009, Applicant was employed by a community college as a 
campus center associate.7 She attended another college from 2004 until 2008, and was 
awarded a master’s degree in an unspecified discipline in December 2008.8 She 
assumed her position with her current employer in August 2009.9 
 
2 Applicant’s Response to the FORM was forwarded to Department Counsel by a Legal Assistant to the 
Department Counsel on July 20, 2010.

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2003. At some 
unspecified point, Applicant failed to keep up with her monthly payments, and accounts 
started to become delinquent. Some of the accounts were placed for collection with a 
variety of collection agents, and some of the accounts were charged off. In her 
Response to the FORM, Applicant attributed her financial situation to the following 
circumstances:10 
 
During the time in question I was under-employed and a single parent 
(until my daughter graduated from college in 2002) while attending college 
part-time during period of 1995-2008, resulted in the student loans. . . . “ 
 
Applicant also indicated that her life was full of raising her daughter and attending 
school, but she failed to explain how her feeling of isolation and being adrift caused her 
to neglect her finances and enable her to fall “into a credit card spiral.”11 She 
acknowledged that “[she] was using the credit cards and the ability to buy things as a 
substitute for what was missing in [her] life.”12 
 
The SOR identified 24 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit 
reports from 200913 and 2010,14 totaling approximately $92,590. Some accounts have 
been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other 
accounts are referenced repeatedly in different credit reports, in many instances 
duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a 
different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, 
while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the 
last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.  
 
Applicant contends that two of the accounts listed in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.r.), 
for a gas utility, are identical accounts,15 although two different collection agencies and 
two different account numbers appear in the credit reports. The outstanding balances 
($537 versus $536) reflected differ by $1. Since both accounts were opened in 2009, I 
am inclined to agree with her contention. Applicant contends she paid the creditor on 
May 18, 2010, but offered no documentation to confirm that such a payment had been 
made. She claimed that it would take 30 days from the date of the payment to obtain 
such documentation.16

Two other accounts listed in the SOR (¶¶ 1.k. and 1.q.), for telephone service, 
are identical accounts with somewhat compatible account numbers,17 and the collection 
agencies identified are two variations of the same agency. The unpaid balance reflected 
for both accounts is $244,18 while one account reflects a past due balance of $144.19 In 
March 2010, Applicant received an offer of settlement to resolve the account with a 
payment of $100.20 Applicant contends she accepted the offer and paid the agreed 
amount, and submitted a statement from the creditor stating the account had been 
“settled in full” with a zero balance.21 
 
One of the accounts listed in the SOR (¶ 1.l.) for a bank loan in the amount of 
$387, was originally past due in the amount of $374 when placed for collection,22 but 
the balance was subsequently increased to $387.23 In May 2010, Applicant received an 
offer of settlement to resolve the account with a payment of $233.37.24 Applicant 
accepted the offer and paid the creditor $234.13.25  
 
Two of the accounts listed in the SOR (¶¶ 1.i. and 1.j.) for credit cards from two 
different banks, were charged off in the respective amounts of $2,156 and $1,020.26 
Applicant noted that fact, but initially provided no indication that she intended to contact 
the creditors to arrange repayments.27 According to Applicant’s newly proposed 
repayment plan, she would eventually, without indicating a commencement date, pay 
each creditor $50 per month to retire those particular debts.28 
 
Applicant claims she does not know the identity of the health care providers for 
two of the accounts listed in the SOR (¶¶ 1.f. and 1.g.) for medical accounts in the

to locate or contact the creditors to arrange repayments. 
 
Applicant also claims she does not know the identity of the original creditor of 
one account listed in the SOR (¶ 1.m.) in the amount of $248. She initially provided no 
indication that she intended to contact the collection agency listed in the credit reports to 
arrange repayments.30 In fact, the original creditor for the account in question is a large 
national bank and is identified in one of the credit reports.31 The high credit on the 
account was $3,707 in 2009, with $668 past due,32 and in 2010, the unpaid balance 
was $248.33 The account is actually identical to another one listed in the SOR (¶ 1.s.), 
with $668 past due, as the accounts have somewhat compatible account numbers,34 
and the collection agencies for both are the same. According to Applicant’s newly 
proposed repayment plan, she would eventually, without indicating a commencement 
date, pay each creditor $50 per month to retire those particular d 35
 
The 2009 credit report lists 21 separate deferred student loan accounts through 
one particular bank lender. Of that number, six of the accounts are delinquent, as 
follows: 
 
• Account x038, balance: $24,229, past due: $1,26136 
• Account x039, balance: $36,742, past due: $1,91237 
• Account x040, balance: $8,664, past due: $76738

The same credit report lists another delinquent student loan, not characterized as 
deferred, through the state education services agency with the same bank lender. The 
past due balance on that account is $2,182.42 The 2010 credit report lists three student 
loan accounts in collection,43 and they are the same ones listed in the SOR:44 
 
• Past due balance: $73,264 (¶ 1.n.) 
• Past due balance: $2,213 (¶ 1.o.) 
• Past due balance: $2,209 (¶ 1.p.) 
 
Applicant contends that some of her delinquent student loans were being paid by 
wage garnishment payments45 in unspecified amounts, but has offered no documentary 
evidence to support her contention. Those payments supposedly ceased when, on 
March 22, 2010, Applicant and the state education services agency agreed to a 
repayment plan under which she agreed to make monthly payments of $600 towards 
her student loan,46 a loan with an account number completely different from any of the 
other student loans. She furnished on-line image prints of her first four monthly 
payments.47 It is not known if Applicant’s student loans were consolidated so that the 
payment is covering all of them, or if there are some separate delinquent student loans 
which are still not being addressed. 
 
The SOR lists three delinquent medical accounts (¶¶ 1.e., 1.h., and 1.x.) in the 
respective amounts of $98, $61, $20, which, according to the 2009 credit report, are 
being serviced by the same collection agency.48 A fourth delinquent medical account in 
the SOR (¶ 1.d.,) in the amount of $694 is listed in the 2010 credit report, but the 
identity of the collection agency is not specified, except by a code.49 Applicant knows 
the identity of each of the creditors, and claims the four accounts are being serviced by 
the same collection agency. She also claims she established a voluntary repayment 
plan on an unspecified date.50 According to Applicant’s proposed plan, she was to pay

$50 per month to eventually retire those particular debts.51 She made her initial 
payment of $200 in May 2010,52 and a subsequent payment of $80 in July 2010,53 
neither of which was in compliance with the repayment plan. She has offered no 
documentation to indicate the terms of her repayment agreement, or any indication from 
the collection agency that it has agreed to her proposed terms, or to confirm that such 
an agreement exists. The inconsistent payment amounts and the payment dates raise 
substantial questions as to the existence of an agreement or Applicant’s ability to 
comply with the terms of an exist
 
Applicant contends she made payments or was scheduled to make payments of 
unspecified amounts for several accounts listed in the SOR, as follows:  
 
• Utility service, past due balance: $124 (¶ 1.b.), purportedly paid on May 
18, 201054 
• Cable service, past due balance: $135 (¶ 1.c.), purportedly paid on May 
19, 201055  
• Book club, past due balance: $89 (¶ 1.w.), purportedly scheduled to pay 
unspecified settlement amount on May 26, 201056 
 
She offered no documentation to confirm that such payments had been made, and 
claimed that it would take 30 days from the date of the individual payments to obtain 
such documentation.57 
 
 According to Applicant’s newly proposed repayment plan, she would eventually, 
without indicating a commencement date, pay one particular creditor, a large nationally 
known retailer, with a past due balance of $7,288, listed in the SOR (¶ 1.t.) $50 per 
month to retire that particular debt.58 The two remaining delinquent accounts listed in 
the SOR pertaining to a music company with a past due balance of $182 (¶ 1.u.) and a 
book club with a past due balance of $35 (¶ 1.v.) would be paid once the other debts 
were satisfied.59

 In June 2010, Applicant enrolled in an online course called Credit Report and 
Repair. The course consisted of 15 lessons and assignments during an estimated 20.75 
hours over a nine day period, and it was successfully completed on July 1, 2010.60 
 
 In anticipation of her submission of her Response to the FORM, Applicant 
prepared a household budgeting worksheet, similar to a personal financial statement, 
indicating monthly net income of $2,444, monthly living expenses of $854, monthly 
secured debt payments (for rent and student loans) of $1,270, for a total of $2,124 in 
monthly expenses, and a monthly net remainder of $320 available for discretionary 
spending.61 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”62 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”63   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”64 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.65  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”66 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”67 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
64 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
65 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying. 
 
As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2003. At some unspecified point, she failed to keep up with her monthly payments, and 
accounts started to become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection and 
some accounts were charged off. Applicant attributed her financial situation to being 
under-employed, to being a single parent, and to attending college. 
 
The record is silent regarding her purported “under-employment.” Likewise, she 
failed to explain how being a single parent of a child who graduated from college in 
2002 caused her to fail to keep up with her monthly payments. She noted that she was 
attending college part-time during 1995-2008, and incurred student loans, but failed to 
explain why those student loans became delinquent. Applicant did indicate that her life 
was full of raising her daughter and attending school, but she failed to explain how her 
feeling of isolation and being adrift caused her to neglect her finances and enable her to 
fall “into a credit card spiral.” She acknowledged that she was using the credit cards and 
the ability to buy things as a substitute for what was missing in her life. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(e) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
 
11 
                                      
 
                                                          
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@68  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced sometime before 2003, and still have 
not been resolved. While she may have simplistically attributed her continuing financial 
difficulties to being under-employed, to being a single parent and to attending college, 
and some of those issues may have contributed to her debts, she never explained how 
they became the primary cause of her financial problems. To the contrary, she 
mentioned the feeling of isolation and being adrift as the primary causes for her to 
neglect her finances and to enable her to fall “into a credit card spiral.” She 
acknowledged that she was using the credit cards and the ability to buy things as a 
substitute for what was missing in her life. Because the financial situation is frequent 
and continuing in nature, and the causation is not adequately described, AG ¶ 20(a) 
does not apply. Applicant’s handling of her finances, under the circumstances, casts 
doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Applicant’s use of credit cards, as she explained, was irresponsible. Although 
Applicant claimed a variety of causations, the most significant one is that she did not 
exercise the discipline to stop using her credit cards until it was too late. The reasons 
stated do not establish she acted “responsibly under the circumstances.” Accordingly, 
AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. 
 
AG & 20(c) partially applies because Applicant completed an online course called 
Credit Report and Repair in July 2010, nearly 60 days after the SOR was issued. She 
did not offer specific details regarding what she had learned, but because of her 
preparation of a debt repayment plan and the household budgeting worksheet, it 
appears that she may have received some meaningful financial counseling and debt 
consolidation guidance.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant ignored her delinquent debts 
until she finally initiated what might be considered a limited “good-faith” effort to repay a 
few of those delinquent accounts in March 2010. She took no other action until after the 
SOR was issued. She claims she has finally changed her patterns of consumption and 
her purchasing habits, and is making an effort of addressing her financial goals. The 
vast majority of her delinquent accounts remain unpaid or unresolved, and while there 
68 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

are some indications that she intends to repay those delinquent debts eventually, as 
well as some indications that some debts may have been paid, partially or otherwise, 
she has offered little documentation to indicate the terms of her repayment agreements, 
or any indication from the various collection agencies that they have agreed to her 
proposed terms, or to confirm that such agreements exist. In the absence of such 
documentation, most of the evidence consists of promises to pay or unsupported 
contentions that some creditors have been paid. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. After years of 
inaction, in March 2010, Applicant finally started to address her delinquent accounts. 
She has made some payments, some of which are supported by documentation, but the 
vast majority of her accounts are simply on her list of things to do, eventually. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies. She ignored her financial 
responsibilities, attempting to explain that her financial problems were caused by a 
variety of situations, none of which appear to be the actual cause of her delinquencies. 
Her problem was an unabated use of credit cards. The variety of explanations she 
furnished for her lengthy period of inaction reflect traits which raise concerns about her 
fitness to hold a security clearance. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.69 Her recent good-faith efforts are insufficient to mitigate continuing security 
concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
