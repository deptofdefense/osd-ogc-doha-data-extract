GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance or access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 2, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his financial 
situation. He responded to the interrogatories on April 9, 2010.2 On May 13, 2010, 
DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated July 2, 2007. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated April 9, 2010).

(Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 24, 2010. In a sworn, written 
statement, dated June 9, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on July 8, 2010, and the case was assigned to 
me on August 4, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 23, 2010, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 23, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (1-5) and 13 Applicant exhibits (A-M) 
were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and two witnesses testified on 
his behalf. The record remained open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement 
it, and on September 28, 2010, he submitted four additional exhibits (N-Q) that were 
admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript was received on October 1, 
2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in ¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.i. of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings 
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon 
due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a senior mechanical engineer,3 and he is seeking to retain a SECRET security 
clearance. A high school graduate with substantial university credits,4 he has no military 
experience.5 He was granted a SECRET security clearance in 1984.6 He assumed his 
position with his current employer in September 1984.7 
 
Applicant was married in 1977 and divorced in 1978.8 He married his current wife 
in 1985.9 He has two stepchildren (both born in 1974).10

Financial Considerations 
 
Because of her poor health, Applicant’s mother-in-law was relocated to, and 
resided in, Applicant’s home for about 17 years.11 His father’s poor health resulted in his 
relocation as well, and he resided in Applicant’s home for six years.12 Applicant’s wife 
was the primary care provider, and she used as much annual and family leave, as well 
as leave without pay, as possible before being forced to relinquish her full-time position 
in 2005, in favor of a part-time position.13 His wife remained in a part-time status for 
nearly two and one-half years.14 Her annual full-time salary was $23,000, and her part-
time annual salary was between $10,000 and $12,000.15 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2005, when his 
mother-in-law’s health deteriorated.16 Although Applicant was receiving their cumulative 
$1,000 monthly Social Security contributions,17 the routine family expenses, including 
medications for the parents and medical care for his mother-in-law, and his wife’s loss 
of income, began to take their toll on the family finances.18 In May 2007, Applicant’s 
mother-in-law passed away, and nine months later, in February 2008, his father passed 
away.19 Following the loss of her mother, Applicant’s wife became depressed, unable to 
perform meaningful activities, including the handling of family finances, for about eight 
months.20 The loss of the Social Security contributions because of their respective 
deaths reduced the family monthly income and although Applicant’s wife was eventually 
able to return to her part-time position, the full-time position was no longer available.21 
With depleted savings, and reduced income, some unanticipated expenses, including

$15,000 in funeral expenses, had to be paid by using credit cards.22 None of 
Applicant’s, nor his wife’s, siblings would or could assist them with expenses.23  
 
Applicant had previously been able to remain current with all of his financial 
obligations, and initially, unsuccessfully, attempted to withdraw funds from his 401(k) to 
do so.24 He eventually prevailed, and was permitted to withdraw $2,000, and applied 
that money to his credit cards.25 He also tried to get as much overtime as possible and 
he and his wife took odd jobs to generate funds because they did not want to resort to 
bankruptcy.26 Although Applicant’s wife had the primary responsibility for the bills, 
Applicant periodically inquired as to their status, but was advised that everything was 
under control.27 At some unspecified point, Applicant failed to keep up with his monthly 
payments, causing interest rates to increase, and accounts started to become 
delinquent. Some of the accounts were placed for collection with a variety of collection 
agents, and some of the accounts were charged off.28  
 
For a period of about six months, Applicant worked with an unspecified individual 
or company in an effort to consolidate his debts, but the proposed payments would have 
been higher than if he had continued making minimum payments.29 His wife even called 
several creditors seeking to make settlements, but the creditors were not willing to do 
so.30 Finally, when nothing seemed to work favorably, they sought the assistance of a 
bankruptcy attorney, and based upon his advice, they stopped all payments on their 
delinquent accounts.31 About one year later, on April 7, 2010, Applicant and his wife 
filed a joint voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code.32 In the petition, he listed $188,940 in assets (including $180,000.00 in real 
property), and $279,059.32 in liabilities.33  Applicant and his wife reported creditors 
holding unsecured nonpriority claims worth $71,496.32.34 They were granted a 
discharge on August 2, 2010.35

The SOR identified eight purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by 
credit reports from 2007, 2009, and 2010, totaling approximately $53,684. Some 
accounts reflected in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to 
other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in these 
as well as other different credit reports, in many instances duplicating other accounts 
listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some 
accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified by 
partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others 
eliminating other digits. Some accounts reflect no account number. Among the debts 
discharged were the ones listed in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h. of the SOR.36 
 
On April 7, 2010, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement indicating 
combined monthly net income of $5,020.27, monthly expenses of $1,975.00, monthly 
debt repayments of $1,796.59, and a net remainder of $1,248.68 available for 
discretionary spending.37 His wife was laid off from her part-time job in July 2010.38 
Applicant’s current annual salary is $85,498.00.39 He currently has no delinquent 
accounts.40 
  
On May 15, 2010, Applicant and his wife completed a course on personal 
financial management given on the Internet as required by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.41

In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which 
conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines 
is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”44 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”45   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”46 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
42 Applicant’s Exhibits A – D (Letters of Recommendation, various dates). 
 
43 Applicant Exhibits E – H (Performance Assessment and Development Review, various dates).

46 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.47  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”48 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”49 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
47 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
48 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
49 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
                                                          
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying. 
 
As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2005. At some unspecified point, he failed to keep up with his monthly payments, and 
accounts started to become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection and 
some accounts were charged off. Applicant attributed his financial situation to having 
stretched his income while his wife had reduced her income to care for her mother and 
his father for a substantial period. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@50  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced sometime in 2005, when his mother-
in-law’s health began to deteriorate. Because his financial difficulties commenced five 
years ago, and continued until 2010, it was initially frequent and continuing in nature. 
However, Applicant eventually took the situation under control, and, although he 
attempted to avoid bankruptcy, eventually succumbed to it and resolved all of the 
delinquent accounts by having them discharged in bankruptcy. His initial reliance on his 
50 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

wife’s handling the family finances raised significant doubt as to his reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment, but his subsequent involvement in the handling of 
his finances, as well as his decision to seek resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, under the circumstances, has eliminated such doubts. AG ¶ 20(a) 
applies because it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.51   
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies because Applicant went through a lengthy period during 
which his wife had to surrender her full-time position, along with substantial pay and 
benefits, to serve as primary caregiver to her mother and his father for a lengthy period. 
The costs associated with that family endeavor were both tangible and intangible, 
resulting in monetary loss and an impact on his wife’s mental health. When his mother-
in-law and his father died, they were faced with reduced income and increased 
expenses associated with their respective funerals. His wife’s lengthy part-time 
employment and inability to reacquire full-time employment only exacerbated the 
financial problems. Her depression following the death of her mother also contributed to 
the problem. These events were clearly beyond Applicant’s control, and Applicant acted 
responsibly to address the debts that resulted.52 
 
AG & 20(c) applies because Applicant received financial counseling associated 
with his bankruptcy, and there is clear and abundant evidence that his financial 
problems are resolved and are under control. He no longer has any delinquent 
accounts, has established a budget, presented a personal financial statement, and now 
has a monthly net remainder available as savings for emergencies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies because Applicant attempted to address his 
delinquent debts well before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, circumstances were 
such that he was unable to resolve them either by settling them or by paying them off, 
although he attempted to do so.53 As a result, he reluctantly turned to an attorney who 
advised that he file for bankruptcy. It took him some time to gather the funds necessary 
to do so, but he did, and all of his delinquent debts were discharged. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
51 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).

53 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has a 
history of financial delinquencies commencing in 2005. He lived beyond his means and 
permitted accounts to become delinquent and placed for collection or charged off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. Those 
delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of his wife’s relinquishing her full-time 
position in favor of a part-time position to furnish necessary primary care for her mother 
and Applicant’s father. There were health expenses and funeral expenses along with 
the loss of $1,000 a month in Social Security benefits. While it is true that he was 
unable to successfully address his delinquent accounts by settling or paying them off, 
he finally resolved them. His unsuccessful efforts should not be overlooked simply 
because he eventually turned to bankruptcy. Applicant’s financial situation is now 
excellent with a substantial monthly net remainder available for savings, discretionary 
spending, or emergency use. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light 
of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.54 His substantial good-faith efforts are sufficient to mitigate continuing security 
concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).
