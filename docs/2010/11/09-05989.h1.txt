HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to disclose her financial problems on her April 27, 2009 security 
clearance application; however, she did not intend to deceive the Government. Personal 
conduct concerns are mitigated. Her statement of reasons (SOR) lists nine delinquent 
debts totaling $28,093. She failed to make sufficient progress resolving her SOR debts, 
and financial considerations concerns are not mitigated at this time. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 27, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
April 6, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On April 18, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
(HE 3) On August 23, 2010, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed 
on Applicant’s case. On August 25, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On 
September 22, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On October 19, 2010, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits 
(GE 1-4) (Tr. 17), and Applicant offered seven exhibits. (Tr. 17, 19-21; AE A-G) There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 and AE A-G. (Tr. 17, 21) Additionally, I 
admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR as hearing 
exhibits. (HE 1-3) On October 27, 2010, I received the transcript. I held the record open 
until November 18, 2010. (Tr. 71-72) On November 24, 2010, I received five additional 
exhibits. (AE H-L) There were no objections to Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits, and I 
admitted them into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted eight of the nine SOR debts. She admitted 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, and 2.a. (HE 3) She denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.g. Her

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant admitted that she and her husband lived beyond their means when she 
moved from Korea to the United States. (Tr. 59) For example, they purchased two cars 
and a motorcycle and shopped a lot. (Tr. 59-61) Up to the time of her hearing, she had 
not made any payments to any of her SOR creditors. (Tr. 66) 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed nine debts totaling $28,093. The status of her nine SOR 
debts is as follows:  
 
1.a (judgment to department store—$769)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant 
purchased rims for her vehicle at the department store, which generated the unpaid 
debt. (Tr. 29-31; AE F at 2) She called the phone number of the creditor listed on the 
creditor’s website; however, the phone number she called was not valid.  
 
1.b (communications collection debt—$557)—PAYMENT PLAN. At her hearing, 
Applicant said she plans to pay $278.50 on October 22, 2010, and $278.50 on 
November 5, 2010, resolving the debt. (Tr. 31-33; AE F at 2) Her post-hearing budget 
showed that she planned to make her final payment on December 5, 2010. (AE H)  
 
1.c (collection debt—$633)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant obtained a payday loan; 
however, when she was ready to repay the debt, she learned the account had been 
moved to a different collection agent. (Tr. 33-35) She was unable to contact the new 
holder of the debt. (Tr. 35) 
 
1.d ($84 overdue on account—$772)—PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant owes $1,430 
to the creditor. She plans to pay $121.36 every two weeks for six months to resolve the 
debt, with her first payment being made on November 19, 2010. (Tr. 36-39; AE F at 2) 
After her hearing, she provided a November 8, 2010 letter from the creditor indicating 
her post-dated check for $121.36 would be deposited on November 19, 2010. (AE J)    
 
1.e (communications collection account—$1,479)—UNRESOLVED. The creditor 
offered to settle the debt for $800 if paid by December 31, 2010. (Tr. 39-40; AE F at 2) 
She believes she will have sufficient funds to make the one-time $800 payment. (Tr. 39-
40)     
 
1.f (communications collection account—$346)—PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant 
agreed to pay $178.91 on November 19, 2010, and $178.91 on December 5, 2010. (Tr. 
40-41; AE F at 2) After her hearing, she provided a checking account statement 
showing a $178.91 payment on November 8, 2010. (AE I) 
 
1.g (collection debt—$910)—NOT ESTABLISHED. Applicant telephoned the 
creditor and asked for information about the debt; however, the creditor was unable to 
obtain proof that she owed the debt. (Tr. 44) She did not provide documentation 
showing she disputed the account.

1.h (vehicle collection debt—$17,133)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant and her 
former spouse purchased a vehicle together that was repossessed. (Tr. 44) They made 
a settlement offer of $9,000, with an initial payment of $4,500, followed by monthly 
payments; however, their offer was rejected. (Tr. 44-49; AE F at 2) The creditor is now 
seeking $22,000, and the creditor is willing to accept a payment plan. (Tr. 45) Her 
former husband refuses to make any payments on the debt. (Tr. 47-48) She did not 
indicate that she agreed to start making payments under the creditor’s proposed 
payment plan. 
 
1.i (collection debt—$6,182)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant and her former husband 
borrowed the money, and did not repay the debt. (Tr. 50) She has not contacted the 
creditor, and the debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 50) 
 
In November 2009, Applicant purchased a Ford Explorer. (Tr. 62) Her monthly 
payment is $597. (Tr. 62) The account is current. (Tr. 62) She considered obtaining 
financial counseling; however, she did not actually obtain financial counseling. (Tr. 65-
66) After her hearing, she provided an updated budget. (AE H) Her budget showed she 
planned to make payments to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f. (AE H)  
 
On June 10, 2009, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant about her delinquent debts. (GE 2) Applicant admitted that she 
and her husband spent frivolously. (GE 2) They began to fall behind on their debts 
because they were transferred to a location where the housing allowance was much 
less. (GE 2) After Applicant was discharged from the Army in July 2007, she was 
unemployed for two months. (GE 2) Applicant plans to pay her debts. (GE 2) 
  
At her hearing, Applicant promised to provide proof of any payments made prior 
to November 18, 2010. (Tr. 71) After her hearing, Applicant provided proof that she 
made one $178.91 payment to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f on November 8, 2010. (AE I) I 
also credit her with making a $121 payment on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. Her November 
18, 2010 credit report provided contained additional financial information as follows: (1) 
A $3,000 Government overpayment collection debt is owed to Veterans Affairs. (AE L at 
10); (2) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g has increased to $1,501. (AE L at 12); (3) Her student 
loans are in current status (AE L at 15, 16); and (4) Several entries showed note loans 
and automobile loans paid satisfactorily. (AE L at 17-19)    
 
Falsification of security clearance application 
 
On April 27, 2009, Applicant completed her SF 86. Section 26 asks a series of 
questions concerning adverse financial information. The first four questions are limited 
to the last seven years, and all five questions are relevant to Applicant’s disclosure of 
her financial circumstances to the Government: 
 
26e. Have you had a judgment entered against you? 
 
26g. Have you had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? 
 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
26h. Have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or 
cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? 
 
26m. Have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? and 
 
26n. Are you currently delinquent over 90 days on any debt(s)? 
 
Applicant answered, “No” to all five questions and did not disclose any adverse 
financial information. When she was completing her SF 86, she tried to put “Yes” on her 
SF 86; however, the electronic SF 86 would not allow her to complete the form unless 
she specifically listed some delinquent debts, and she did not know the specific 
information needed to complete her SF 86. (Tr. 53) She knew, for example, that they 
stopped making payments on a vehicle and it was repossessed. (Tr. 54) She did not 
seek help or advice on completion of her SF 86. (Tr. 53) Applicant was aware of her 
delinquent debt. She knew the Government was going to find out about her delinquent 
debt because she was aware that the Government obtains a credit report as part of the 
clearance investigation. (Tr. 52, 54)

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her OPM personal subject interview (PSI), and her statement at her 
hearing. Applicant’s SOR lists nine delinquent debts totaling $28,093. Some of her 
debts have been delinquent for more than two years. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants partial application of AG ¶¶ 
20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).2 Although Applicant did not receive financial counseling, she 
generated several budgets and her knowledge of supply procedures gives her a good 
understanding of the requirements to maintain a budget and pay her debts. She showed 
some good faith when she admitted responsibility for eight of nine SOR debts. 
Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by insufficient income, a brief period of 
unemployment in 2007, divorce, delay after her divorce in her receipt of child support 
payments, and her spouse’s financial irresponsibility. However, her financial 
circumstances have been stable from July 2009 because she was employed without 
any periods of unemployment and was receiving child support.  
 
Applicant did not establish that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
She received about $9,643 severance pay before taxes when she left active duty, which 
compensated for her two months of unemployment following her discharge. She 
admitted that she spent frivolously or excessively. She did not maintain contact with all 
 
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

and one $178 payment to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f. Her financial problem is not being 
resolved and is not under control because over the last 12 months her SOR debts are 
increasing faster than they are being paid.  
 
I have credited Applicant with refuting the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.g. The only 
evidence of this debt is her credit report. She accepted responsibility for the other eight 
SOR debts and credibly denied responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. In sum, 
Applicant’s efforts are insufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsification of her SF 86 on April 27, 2009, in 
this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative.4  
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
Applicant admitted that on her April 27, 2009 SF 86, she failed to disclose debts 
that were currently delinquent more than 90 days. As to the last seven years, she failed 
to disclose: (1) debts that were delinquent more than 180 days; (2) a judgment entered 
against her; (3) bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; and (4) any of her 
accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as 
agreed. Applicant contended that her inaccurate answers were not deliberate and 
intentional attempts to deceive the Government.  
 
When Applicant completed her SF 86, she attempted to answer “yes” to the 
questions about her delinquent debts; however, the SF 86 computer program will not 
accept a “yes” answer without the Applicant providing details about delinquent debts. 
She knew that the Government would receive the delinquent debt information anyway 
from her credit reports. When Applicant had her OPM PSI, she discussed her debts and 
other financial information in detail. I find the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a is unsubstantiated 
because Applicant did not deliberately intend to provide false information to deceive the 
Government about her past due debts.   
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant’s level of 
education and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to 
disclose past-due debts on a security clearance application was deliberate).

guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of her access to classified information. Applicant is 28 years old. She is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with her security responsibilities. She 
deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an 
employee of a contractor and during her seven years of active duty Army service. She 
earned several military awards, successfully completed some military courses, rose to 
the grade of sergeant (E-5), received an excellent NCOER, and received an honorable 
discharge from the Army. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States 
and her employer. There is no evidence that she abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. 
Her divorce, her unemployment, the delay in her receipt of child support payments, and 
problems with her spouse’s handling of their finances contributed to her financial woes. 
Two character witnesses laud her diligence, professionalism, and responsibility. I give 
Applicant substantial credit for admitting responsibility for eight of her nine SOR debts 
totaling about $28,000, and being honest to the OPM investigator about her financial 
plight. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Applicant’s SOR listed nine delinquent debts totaling 
$28,093. She denied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($910). I have credited her with having 
payment plans on the debts on SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($557), 1.d ($772), and 1.f ($346), even 
though she only provided proof of one $121 payment on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d and one 
$178 payment on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($346). Her financial situation has deteriorated 
somewhat since the SOR was issued. For example, the debt is SOR ¶ 1.d went from 
$772 to $1,430, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h went from $17,133 to $22,000. Although 
there is also the possibility that she has a new debt to Veteran’s Affairs for a $3,000 
overpayment, I decline to consider this possible new debt in this case as adverse 
financial information.5 Applicant has failed to make sufficient progress resolving her 
delinquent SOR debts.    
 
 
5The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to pay the Veterans Affairs overpayment of $3,000. 
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in 
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). I decline to consider the non-SOR misconduct for any purpose because Applicant did not 
have an opportunity to address this debt at her hearing, and did not discuss it in her post-hearing 
documentation.

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns are mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i:  Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
