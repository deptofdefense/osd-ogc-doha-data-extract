Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant has disputed his federal income tax liability for years. He recently offered
to pay $56,000 to compromise the $86,000 liability that has been determined to be his tax
debt to the Government. Applicant has funds available to pay the entire balance owed if
the Government refuses to accept his future offers to compromise. In 2002, Applicant
sought Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection during the course of a contentious divorce. He
paid all listed creditors one hundred percent of what he owed them. Clearance is granted.
On April 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on May 10, 2010. He
admitted both SOR allegations and requested a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on July 13, 2010. A notice of hearing was issued on
July 23, 2010, scheduling the hearing for August 19, 2010. The hearing was conducted as
scheduled. The government submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant
testified and submitted 14 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant’s Exhibit
(AE) 1-14 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on
August 30, 2010.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant is a 62-year-old man who has worked as a contract administrator for a
federal contractor since 1983. Applicant obtained a juris doctorate degree in 1983, and he
began simultaneous self-employment as an attorney in 1992. He possessed a top secret
security clearance  while he served on active duty in the U. S. Air Force from 1969-72. He
has held a secret security clearance since either 1982 or 1983. No prior action has ever
been taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance for adverse reasons. 
Applicant has been married since August 2002. He was previously married from
June 1968 until that marriage ended in divorce in September 1978; from November 1978
until that marriage ended in divorce in March 1983; and from May 1992 until that marriage
ended in divorce in December 2000. Applicant has one adult child. 
Applicant’s financial issues, as alleged in the SOR, resulted from the dissolution of
his third marriage. His third wife was responsible for the family and law practice financial
affairs, including filing tax returns. As the marriage apparently began to deteriorate, she
began to appropriate monies to herself and to make numerous of allegations of
wrongdoing on the part of Applicant, including to his federal employer and the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).
Applicant’s third wife submitted fraudulent pleadings in the course of their divorce
that caused the court to enter an order providing for the sale of Applicant’s residence. In
response, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection to effectively stay the
divorce court order while he simultaneously filed a petition in the state court to quiet title
on his residence. The quiet title action was decided in his favor and he paid all creditors
he had listed in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case one hundred percent of what he owed
them.
Applicant has been involved in on-going disputes with the IRS for income taxes he
owe as a result of his law practice. He has been audited for multiple tax years and he has
sought relief through the tax courts. His liability for unpaid income taxes has been
determined to be about $86,000 due to the disallowance of deductions he took based on
his law practice which the IRS determined was a hobby rather than a business. Applicant
does not dispute that as a result of the tax court decision he is indebted to the

3Government. However, he has continued to engage in a dialogue with the IRS in an effort
to convince them, consistent with various claims that he has made under tax laws and
regulations, to accept a negotiated settlement for less than the full amount due. 
On June 2, 2010, the IRS Revenue Officer Applicant has been corresponding with
notified him that she was proposing to recommend rejection of his $56,000 offer in
compromise to settle the tax debt. She also notified him he could submit additional
information if he so desired as long as it was received by July 19, 2010. Applicant
responded to that notice on July 14, 2010. On August 2, 2010, the IRS Revenue Officer
responded to Applicant’s July 14, 2010 letter, and notified him that she was again
recommending rejection of his offer and that if her recommendation was approved that he
would receive a letter advising him that the offer had been rejected and explaining his
appeal rights. Applicant has about $105,000 available in a 401(k) that he intends to apply
to use to satisfy the tax liability when all his avenues seeking compromise have been
exhausted. 
  
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial decision based upon relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6
of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Guideline F
(financial considerations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant
in this case. 
  The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of5
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant6
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against

him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant sought Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2002 during a contentious
divorce as a legal means of protecting his residence from loss due to a court order his wife
obtained through fraud. He thereafter defeated her effort to obtain the residence through
a quiet title action, and he paid all the creditors he had listed in the bankruptcy one
hundred percent of what he owed them. 
Applicant has been engaged for years in legal wranglings with the IRS over the
income tax liability he accrued as the result of his law practice. He has gone through a
number of audits and he sought relief through the tax court. His liability has been
determined to be approximately $86,000. He recently offered $56,000 in compromise of
that liability, which offer apparently will be rejected by the IRS. Whatever the ultimate
outcome of his dispute with the IRS, Applicant has the ability and the intent to pay either
the full amount owed or such lesser sum as the IRS agrees to accept in compromise. 
Applicant has never displayed an inability or unwillingness to pay his debts. Rather,
he has used the legal means available to him in efforts to protect his property from a
vindictive wife and to reduce the liability that the Government has determined he owes from
disallowed deductions from his law practice. No disqualifying condition applies.    
5
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole-person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant mitigated the financial
considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his
ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a & b: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is granted.
