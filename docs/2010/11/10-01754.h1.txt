HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has one allegedly delinquent debt, a Social Security Administration 
(SSA) overpayment of $75,919. She disputes her responsibility to repay this debt, and 
an SSA hearing is scheduled for December 1, 2010. Financial considerations are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 5, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
July 28, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On August 18, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
(HE 3) On September 19, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On September 23, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case 
to me. On October 1, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On November 3, 
2010, Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven 
exhibits (GE 1-7) (Tr. 27), and Applicant offered four exhibits. (AE A-D) (Tr. 16-18; pg. 
1-91) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 and AE A-D. (Tr. 17-18, 27) I 
also admitted documents relating to SSA disability determinations and the appeal 
process. (Tr. 29-32; Administrative Notice Exhibits (ANE) I-V) Additionally, I admitted 
the hearing notice, SOR, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and email correspondence 
between me, Department Counsel and Applicant as hearing exhibits. (HE 1-4) I held the 
record open until November 10, 2010 for the parties to submit additional evidence. (Tr. 
63) After the hearing, Department Counsel provided an updated credit report (GE 8), 
and Applicant provided six exhibits. (AE E-J) There were no objections to the post-
hearing exhibits, and I admitted them into evidence. On November 10, 2010, I received 
the transcript. I also attached several legal references regarding Social Security 
overpayments and bankruptcy law to the record. (Appellate Exhibits I-IV)    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admits that she received benefits from the SSA, and 
that her debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on March 18, 
2005. (HE 3) Her admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor. (Tr. 7, 33) She 
graduated from high school in 1981. (Tr. 7-8, 33) In 2002, she received an associates 
degree in applied computer technology. (Tr. 8) She has never served in the military. (SF 
86) She has never been married and does not have any children. (SF 86) In 2008, she 
received a Secret clearance. (Tr. 9) The only negative entries on her credit reports are 
her SSA debt and her 2005 bankruptcy. (Tr. 67; GE 8) She disclosed her bankruptcy on 
her SF 86. 
  
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists two allegations. SOR ¶ 1.a alleged the SSA placed an 
overpayment of $75,919 for collection. SOR ¶ 1.b states her debts were discharged 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on March 18, 2005.  
 
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

In 1994, Applicant lost her job with the post office and decided to file for disability 
from the SSA. (Tr. 37) She also filed a grievance against the post office. In January 
2006, she was able to return to her post office employment. (Tr. 37, 40)  
 
On February 3, 1995, the SSA determined Applicant was entitled to disability 
because she is deaf, and she had problems with her back. (Tr. 38-39; AE E at 1) On 
November 13, 2003, SSA notified Applicant that she was not entitled to payments 
beginning in October 1999 because her income exceeded the thresholds for payment of 
benefits. (AE E at 11) Her SSA disability payments did not resume after November 
2003. (Tr. 43) On May 24, 2006, SSA sent Applicant a notice informing her that SSA 
calculated the overpayment to be $75,919, and the overpayment was not waived 
because she was at fault. (AE E at 2)  
 
On June 20, 2006, Applicant requested a hearing. (Tr. 44; AE E at 2) On March 
4, 2008, Applicant had a hearing, which was held to determine whether Applicant “was 
without fault in causing the overpayment; and if she was without fault, whether recovery 
of the overpayment should be waived.” (AE E at 3)    
 
The SSA Judge briefly summarized the legal standards for requiring repayment 
of an SSA disability overpayment as follows: 
   
A finding of fault will be made if an individual made an incorrect 
statement which he or she knew or should have known was incorrect, or 
failed to furnish information which the individual knew or should have 
known was important, or accepted a payment which he or she knew or 
could have been expected to know was incorrect. (20 C.F.R. 404.507) 
 
Recovery of an overpayment will be waived if a beneficiary is 
without fault, and recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security 
Act, or would be against equity and good conscience. (Section 204(b) and 
20 C.F.R. 404.506) 
 
Recovery will be found to defeat the purpose of Title II if it results in 
depriving an individual of income needed to meet current ordinary and 
necessary expenses, or would reduce assets below statutory levels. (20 
C.F.R. 404.508) 
 
Recovery would be against equity and good conscience if a person 
changed his or her position for the worse, or relinquished a valuable right, 
having relied on the award of benefits. (20 C.F.R. 404.509) 
 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
AE E at 5.2 Applicant urged the SSA Judge not to require her to repay the overpayment 
arguing: (1) She worked as an intern while in school from 1999 to 2002, and then part 
time until March 1, 2004. (AE E at 6); (2) She informed SSA each and every time she 
worked (AE 6 at 12); (3) She did not earn the amounts of money that SSA contended 
she earned; and (4) She disagreed with the amount of the overpayment because she 
did not receive all of her disability checks. (AE E at 10) The SSA Judge determined that 
Applicant “has not established that she was without fault in causing and accepting the 
overpayment” and “recovery of the overpayment cannot be waived.”3 (AE E at 11)  
 
The SSA Judge’s decision does not provide a year-by-year breakdown of the 
amounts owed or overpaid by the SSA. The SSA Judge’s decision states she earned 
$40,800 in 1997, $30,659 in 1998, $13,360 in 1999, $0 in 2000; $4,636 in 2001, $2,906 
in 2002, $15,267 in 2003, and $23,650 in 2004. (AE E at 7) The SSA Judge explained 
this income represents substantial gainful activity (SGA) and that she could earn $500 
per month until June 1999; $700 per month until December 2000; $720 per month in 
2000 and 2001; $800 per month in 2003; and $820 per month in 2004 before her SSA 
disability payment would be reduced. (AE E at 7)  
 
Applicant appealed the SSA Judge’s decision, and on July 15, 2010, the SSA 
Appeals Council noted Applicant reported her income and cited four exhibits. (AE A at 
2) As to her knowledge that she was not entitled to the SSA disability payment, 
Applicant contended that she did not understand the SSA process and cited the SSA’s 
failure to provide an adequate translator. (AE A at 3) The remand directed the SSA 
Judge to make findings in several areas, including misinformation received from the 
SSA, income Applicant received, whether Applicant was at fault in the overpayment, 
and whether recovery of the overpayment may be waived. (AE A at 3) Applicant’s 
counsel stated that Applicant’s SSA hearing is now scheduled for December 1, 2010. 
(AE G) 
 
SSA started a garnishment of Applicant’s pay to recoup the overpayment, and 
then stopped the garnishment because Applicant filed an appeal. (Tr. 50; GE 7) SSA is 
currently collecting $20 per month from Applicant. (Tr. 47-50; AE D) The SSA advised 
Applicant that her payments would be refunded if she prevailed at her hearing. (Tr. 47) 
There is no SSA documentation of record indicating her SSA debt is currently 
delinquent. Even if all of her appeals are denied, the SSA will limit her required 
repayment to a level she can afford based on her income and expenses. (Tr. 53)        
 
 
 
 
 
2A copy of Title 42 U.S.C. § 404, including interpretative notes and decisions, is at Appellate 
Exhibit IV, and 20 C.F.R. §404.408 is at Appellate Exhibit V. Appellate Exhibit IV includes a discussion of 
the applicability of bankruptcy to discharge a debt generated by an overpayment of social security 
disability benefits.  
 
3The SSA Judge’s decision specifies that a repayment plan is not within the scope of the 
decision. (AE E at 9 n. 7)

Chapter 7 bankruptcy on March 18, 2005 
 
 On December 9, 2004, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection, and 
on March 18, 2005, her unsecured debts were discharged. Her student loan of $16,851 
was not discharged by her bankruptcy. (Tr. 58) Her bankruptcy was caused by 
underemployment. As indicated previously, she had several years with low income and 
her debts were substantial. (Tr. 36) Excluding her Social Security disability payments 
from 2000 to 2004, her income totaled $46,457, and over those five years her non-
Social Security income averaged $9,291 per year. (AE E at 7) 
     
 Applicant’s student loan and car loan are current. (Tr. 58; GE 8) She paid her 
taxes. (Tr. 58) Aside from her disputed SSA debt, all debts are current. (Tr. 58; GE 8) 
She received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process, and the file 
contains a personal financial statement (PFS) or budget. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her 2005 bankruptcy schedules, her March 17, 2008 SSA decision, and 
her statement at her hearing. Her 2005 bankruptcy schedules by themselves are 
sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(b) 
and 20(c) to her 2005 bankruptcy. Applicant received financial counseling as part of her 
bankruptcy. She also generated a personal financial statement or budget as part of her 
response to DOHA interrogatories. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by 
insufficient income during periods of unemployment and underemployment. She was 
disabled and was unable to obtain or retain adequate employment. However, her 
financial circumstances have been stable from 2005 to the present. Applicant 
established that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Aside from her SSA 
debt, she has maintained contact with her creditors,4 and kept all of her debts in current 
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
status. Her finances are under control. She admitted responsibility for and pays her 
debts, showing good faith mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).5  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is fully applicable to her SSA debt. She actively disputed her 
responsibility for this debt, and her responsibility to pay this debt is not established at 
this time.6 She provided ample evidence of the basis of her dispute, and she has been 
making payments that are satisfactory to the SSA while the overpayments are being 
addressed by the SSA Hearing Judge and SSA Appeals Council. Applicant’s case was 
remanded to a hearing-level SSA Judge, who is required to address several factual and 
legal issues. Her hearing is now scheduled for December 1, 2010. The SSA Appeals 
Council would not have remanded the case if there were not a bona fide, reasonable 
basis to dispute repayment of some or all of the SSA overpayments. There is also an 
issue concerning whether SSA’s possible overpayment of benefits was discharged in 
bankruptcy. See In re Neavear (1982, CA7 Ill) 674 F.2d 1201, 9 B.C.D. 132, 6 C.B.C.2d 
367, CCH Bankr. L. Rep. P. 68656 (holding SSA overpayments are subject to 
bankruptcy discharge). See also Research Guide for 42 U.S.C. § 404 (citing In re 
Neavear). (Appellate Exhibit IV) Applicant’s bankruptcy schedules did not list her SSA 
overpayment as a debt. However, Applicant’s failure to list the SSA debt on her 2005 
bankruptcy does not affect its discharge as part of her bankruptcy.7   
 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6 This decision indicates that Appellant’s dispute of her SSA debt is reasonable and made in good 
faith. This decision does not address the merits of her dispute, as that determination is for the SSA 
Hearing Judge, the SSA Appeals Council and possibly the Bankruptcy Court.  
 
 7Absent fraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy, all unsecured, nonpriority debts are discharged when the 
bankruptcy court grants a discharge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, even when they are not 
listed on a bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis v. Nat’l 
Revenue Service, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010), but see First Circuit Bucks Majority on 
Discharge of Unlisted Debt in No-Asset Case, American Bankruptcy Institute, 28-9 ABIJ 58 (Nov. 2009). 
(Appellate Exhibits I & II) Applicant did not receive her bankruptcy discharge from a bankruptcy court in 
the First Circuit, and she has not lived in a First Circuit state for the last ten years. (SF 86) There is no

In sum, Applicant fell behind on her debts because of underemployment, her 
disability, and her unemployment while attending college. She utilized bankruptcy in 
2005 to obtain a fresh start. Aside from her SSA debt, her credit report does not 
disclose any delinquent debt. She provided documentation showing a reasonable basis 
to dispute her SSA debt. Financial considerations security concerns are fully mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor. She is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with her security responsibilities. She 
deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an 
employee of a contractor. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States 
and her employer. There is no evidence that she has violated security or abuses illegal 
drugs. In 2002, she received an associates degree in applied computer technology. The 
only negative entries on her credit reports are her SSA debt and her 2005 bankruptcy. 
Her underemployment, disability, and unemployment contributed to her financial woes. 
She is also credited with disclosing her bankruptcy on her security clearance 
application. Her SSA debt is being aggressively and reasonably disputed. She is 
making payments on her SSA debt at a level that is satisfactory to the SSA while the 
debt is being addressed by an SSA Judge. If she fails to prevail, and must repay some 
or all of the SSA overpayment, the SSA will take into account her income and expenses 
when computing her required payments. Over the last five years, Applicant has 
established a solid track record of payment of her debts. She has established her 
financial responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.

 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are fully mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
