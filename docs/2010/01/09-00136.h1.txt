Decision
______________
HENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
Applicant executed and signed his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on
August 27, 2008. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F
on July 20, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective
within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 28, 2009. He answered the
SOR in writing on August 25, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative

judge. DOHA received the request. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on
September 18, 2009, and I received the case assignment on October 8, 2009. DOHA
issued a notice of hearing on October 19, 2009, and I convened the hearing as
scheduled on November 4, 2009. The government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6,
which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on
his own behalf. He submitted 27 exhibits (AE) A through AA, which were received and
admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing
(Tr.) on November 12, 2009. I held the record open until December 4, 2009, for
Applicant to submit additional matters. He timely submitted AE BB through AE SS,
without objection. The record closed on December 4, 2009.
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings
Notice
Applicant received the hearing notice on October 26, 2009. (Tr. 12.) I advised
Applicant of his right under ¶ E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the
hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Id.) 
Findings of Fact
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the
SOR. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant, who is 51 years old, works as a tempest engineer for a Department of
Defense contractor. Since 1991, Applicant has worked as an engineer for his current
employer, except for two periods of employment elsewhere. In April 2005, Applicant left
his employer to work for a start-up company. One year later, after the start-up company
position ended, he returned to his employer. In 2008, Applicant again departed his job
with his employer to establish his own business, which ended within the year. He
returned to work with his employer in 2009.  1
Applicant graduated from high school. He received training in the military and on-
the-job. He took some college courses, but does not have a degree. Applicant and his
first wife married and divorced. He married his second wife in 1982 and they divorced in
2000. He has two children, a 24-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old son. Applicant is
not married.2
Applicant described his divorce from his second wife as “messy”. They separated
in 1998 and battled over many issues in court. The court decided on joint custody of
their children, then awarded him primary physical custody of their two children, who

Applicant received two offers on his house: one for $50,000 and one for $80,000. Since the offers were lower5
than his mortgage, he did not accept either. Tr. 57-58.

were 10 and 12 at the time. The court also directed his wife to pay Applicant over $500
a month in child support, which she has not paid. His former wife owes him more than
$28,000 in back child support. He does not anticipate receiving this money. He
accumulated $35,000 in attorney fees during his divorce. He exhausted his savings and
401k account to pay some of these fees. He continues to pay his attorney $100 a
month, with a remaining balance of $2,700 as of October 1, 2009.3
In 2004, a hurricane damaged Applicant’s home. His damages totaled $40,000
and his insurance paid $24,000. He obtained a loan for $10,000 to help pay the repair
costs. He pays $82 a month on this loan. He has been behind occasionally on his
payments. When he made his payment in October 2009, his loan became current. He
indicted that the house damage and subsequent repairs had little negative impact on his
bills, but did effect his cash flow and budgeting.  4
In 2007, he and his first wife decided to live together. She moved into his house
with her teenage daughter. He provided financial support, as she did not work. She did
receive some child support for her daughter. In 2008, they moved 200 miles from his
home. He did not rent his house after they moved. Instead, he placed his house for sale
with an asking price of $135,000, which was more than his mortgage balance of
$98,000. He anticipated paying his debts with the money from the sale of his house. His
house never sold.  In 2008, he paid his mortgage and utilities on his house as well as5
the apartment rent in his new location, for a total monthly expense of more than $2,600
a month. He and his first wife ended their relationship in early 2009, and he moved back
into his house. She died a few months after their relationship ended. He incurred some
unanticipated expenses related to her death in 2009.6
In 1994, Applicant and his second wife filed for bankruptcy. She managed the
household finances and he did not pay attention to her fiscal management until the
finances were out of control. Prior to filing bankruptcy, he has experienced job changes
which impacted his income negatively. The court discharged their debts under Chapter
7 of the bankruptcy code in 1994. From 1994 through 1998, Applicant earned between
$59,900 and $67,500 a year. In 1999, his earnings dropped to $52,800. He slowly
increased his earnings each year through 2004, a year he earned $67,700. In 2005, he
worked for a started-up company, earning $25,000 in income. He returned to his former
employer in 2006, earning $68,000 that year. His income continues to increase. In 2007
and 2008 he earned $118,000 including bonuses.7
Because Applicant is paid weekly, four months a year he receives five paychecks, increasing his net income8
for the four months by $1,408. His monthly expenses remain constant.
Applicant prepared an income and expense affidavit using a family court affidavit. His gross monthly income9
is based on receiving 4 and 1/3 paychecks, not four. His total monthly expenses of $3790 include $440 for
entertainment, vacation, sports, and hobbies. These expenses are optional and not included in the monthly
expense shown. AE AA.

Appellant paid his required $150 co-pay on the date he received the medical services. He argued with the12
insurance company for months over the payment of the remaining balance. Tr. 27-29.

Applicant currently earns $1,923 a week in gross pay and $1,408 a week in net
pay. His net monthly income averages $5,632 (based on four paychecks).  His monthly8
expenses total $3,350.  In addition to his monthly expenses, Applicant pays $1,216 a9
month on his past due debts, his attorney fee, and house repair loan. His remaining
income each month is approximately $1,000 which he uses to pay the entire bill each
month on his one credit card and to pay unanticipated expenses.10
After reviewing the credit report dated September 3, 2008, July 8, 2009, and the
SOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed, excluding any duplicate entries. I
find that Appellant’s actual debts are as follows:11

In late 2008, attorneys for the creditors listed in SOR allegations 1.e through 1.h
instituted civil actions against Applicant for payment of his debts. In each case,
Applicant negotiated a payment plan with the attorney or through the court mediation
process. He signed his first agreement on December 3, 2008 and his last agreement on

June 26, 2009. He reached these agreements three to six months before the SOR was
issued and has complied with the payment plans. Applicant paid two debts not listed in
the SOR in August and September 2009.13
When Applicant filed his federal tax return for 2008 in July 2009, he owed an
additional $1,188 in federal taxes over and above the amount of taxes being withheld
from his pay. He reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to pay $50 a
month on his tax balance. He made his first payment in September 2009.14
Most of the debts in the SOR became delinquent in late 2006 or early 2007.
Applicant used his credit cards to pay regular bills in 2005, when he worked for the
start-up company. For three months during this employment, he did not receive income.
Despite earning income in 2006 comparable to his earnings in 2004, Applicant could not
pay all his credit card debts. Applicant currently has one credit card, which he pays in
full each month. He is now “living on a cash basis and has done pretty well.” He does
not plan to incur future debt and would like to sell his house in the future. His son and
daughter-in-law started living with him in April 2009. His son is a full-time student. His
son and daughter-in-law had jobs in April 2009, but both later lost their jobs. His
daughter-in-law obtained a new job just prior to the hearing.15
Six managers, co-workers, or friends wrote letters of recommendation on behalf
of Applicant. All agree that he is trustworthy and recommend him for a clearance. They
describe him as an expert in a highly specialized field of engineering. They praise his
work ethic and his ability to work with his co-workers and management. Applicant listed
his debts on his security clearance application.16
Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as
7
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available,
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in
making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” An
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security
decision.
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set
out in AG & 18:      
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
8
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.
Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise
security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was unable to
pay these obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these
potentially disqualifying conditions.
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), mitigation may occur when
Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems are
longstanding. His financial problems did not occur under unusual circumstances. This
mitigating condition is not applicable. 
Under AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the
financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant’s divorce from
his second wife was fought through the court system, resulting in significant attorney
fees for him. He depleted his savings and 401k to pay these fees, but this money did
not pay his entire legal bill. He continues to pay his debt, nearly 10 years after his
divorce. His house was damaged in a 2004 hurricane and insurance paid 60% of the
damages. He borrowed money to pay the remaining repair cost. He continues to pay
this debt, although he has been late with his payments. In 2005, he changed jobs,
taking a new job he thought had promise, Instead, the employer lacked funds to pay
him, causing a loss of more than $40,000, or more than 60% in income for the year
2005. Applicant had little choice about what he could do in these circumstances. He
used his credit cards to pay normal expenses when he did not have income. He paid
the bills he could pay, including his attorney and the repair loan. This mitigating
condition is partially applicable.
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial
counseling. However, he has taken control of his finances and his past debts. He paid
nine small debts listed in the SOR and he has payments plans in place for the eight
remaining SOR debts. Two payment plans will be completed by March 1, 2010. In
addition, Applicant developed a payment plan with the IRS, as soon as he received
notice from the IRS about his known tax deficit. He pays his other bills as required.
Applicant’s financial problems are under control, and his past debts are paid or being
resolved through payment plans. 
Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did
not initiate a good-faith effort to repay his bills. He developed four payment plans when
AG ¶¶ 20(e) and 20(f) does not apply in this case.17
9
presented with court action. He paid his small bills or developed repayment plans for
three other debts after he received the SOR. I conclude this mitigating condition does
not apply.17
Whole Person Concept
Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration
of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security
clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and
unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,
not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then
whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant’s eligibility for a security
clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a
reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus
exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. 
The evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the
whole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In
reaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant’s
financial problems began during his second marriage. He and his second wife filed a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1994 when their debts became unmanageable
following income loss and poor fiscal management. The court discharged their debts on
July 11, 1994. When he and his second wife separated and divorced, Applicant’s
financial problems continued as he provided sole support for his children and incurred
significant attorney fees to end his marriage. A hurricane and underemployment created
new financial issues for Applicant. He paid his bills for a time, but in late 2006 he began
to fall behind. He has not clearly explained how this happened. However, when his
income was reduced by more than 60% in 2005, his ability to pay his living expenses
10
was severely impacted. Once he returned to work at a decent salary, he could pay his
regular expenses, but not all his past debts too. The loss of significant income creates
financial problems which takes many months or years to resolve.
In 2007, Applicant and his first wife decided they would try living together again.
He assumed financial responsibility for her and to some level her daughter. Even
though his income began to increase in 2007, the additional cost of supporting two other
individuals limited the availability of his resources to pay his old debts. During this time,
he did not incur more outstanding debts. When they moved 200 miles away from his
home, he decided to sell his home, a sensible decision. Unfortunately, the real estate
market changed drastically and he could not sell his house. He continued to pay the
mortgage and utilities on his house as well as the rent on the apartment in which they
lived. After paying housing costs for both properties and the normal everyday costs of
living, such as food, gasoline, clothing, insurance and repairs, Applicant lacked sufficient
income to pay his old debts. Their living arrangement ended in early 2009, and he
returned to his house, which eliminated the second housing expense. The money he
spent on rent is now being used to pay his debts. His slowness in moving forward with
paying his old debts relates to his finances, which are now much better than three years
ago. He has always acknowledged the debts and his much improved financial position
enables him to pay his past debts. Through his recent efforts, he resolved his smaller
debts by paying the debts, and he resolved his larger debts through payment plans. He
has complied with the payment terms of six plans. Because he complies with these
plans, I infer that he will also comply with his most recent payment plans. Applicant has
taken control of his finances and his debts. He is financially stable and lives within his
financial means. As he said, he is doing well living on a cash basis.
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under
Guideline F.

Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
