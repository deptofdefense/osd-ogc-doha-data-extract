HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed three delinquent debts, totaling 
$30,000, and a bankruptcy in 1996. He resolved the three SOR debts. All of his legally 
enforceable accounts and debts are current. Financial considerations concerns are 
mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 10, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
August 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On September 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (HE 3). Initially, he 
waived his right to a hearing (Transcript (Tr.) 13). After Applicant received the file of 
relevant materials or FORM from Department Counsel, he requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge (Tr. 13-14). On October 15, 2009, Department Counsel 
indicated he was ready to proceed on his case. On October 19, 2009, DOHA assigned 
Applicant’s case to me. On November 13, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). 
On December 15, 2009, Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) (Tr. 19), and Applicant offered nine exhibits 
(Tr. 21-22; AE A-I). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 19-20), and 
AE A-I (Tr. 22). Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the 
SOR (HE 1-3). On December 23, 2009, I received the transcript. On January 7, 2010, I 
received five exhibits from Applicant (AE J-N). Department Counsel did not object (HE 
4), and AE J-N were admitted into evidence that same day. I held the record open until 
January 14, 2010, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 65). 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant denied the three SOR debts and admitted the 
chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts in May 1997 (HE 3). His SOR response did 
not explain why he denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c (HE 3).  
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old program planner (Tr. 7; GE 1 at 15). From February 
2009 to the present, he has been employed by a corporate employer in state A (Tr. 23). 
Another corporate employer in state A employed him from November 2008 to February 
2009 (Tr. 23). Corporate employers in California employed him from February 2001 to 
October 2008 (Tr. 24). In 1980, Applicant graduated from high school (Tr. 7). In 1991, 
he earned a bachelors degree in business management (Tr. 7).  He has never served in 
the military (Tr. 7). He has held a security clearance since 2000 (Tr. 8). 
 
Applicant has never been married (GE 1 at 27). His son was born in 1981 (GE 1 
at 30). His son and his son’s family live in state A (Tr. 50). Applicant took a pay cut from 
an annual salary of $150,000 to $130,000 to live in the same state as his son (Tr. 50). 
He wanted employment that was less stressful (Tr. 52). He is currently living in a one 
bedroom condo (Tr. 51). He was having stress-related medical problems when he lived 
in California, and his health is better now that he lives in state A (Tr. 52).

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed three delinquent mortgage debts totaling $30,000. The 
SOR alleged the following delinquent amounts on those three debts: ¶ 1.a ($26,000); ¶ 
1.b ($3,000); and ¶ 1.c ($1,000) (HE 2).  
 
A Chapter 7 Bankruptcy court discharged Applicant’s debts in May 1997 (SOR ¶ 
1.d). At the time of his bankruptcy, he owed a total of about $6,500, which included a 
vehicle loan, a small amount on a credit card, and $50 owed a store (Tr. 25-26, 59). His 
failure to repay the vehicle loan resulted in a judgment (Tr. 58). He was having financial 
difficulty because of the expense of raising his son (Tr. 26). He described his decision to 
use Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code to discharge this relatively small amount of debt 
as foolish (Tr. 26).  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a (1st mortgage debt—SOR $26,000—actually $647,000) and 1.b 
(2nd mortgage debt—SOR $3,000—actually $105,000) RESOLVED THROUGH 
DEED TRANSFER TO LENDER VIA FORECLOSURE.2 In January 2005, Applicant 
purchased a home in California (hereinafter home R) for $765,000 (Tr. 31). He had an 
appraisal, which showed a market value of $785,000, and he thought it was a prudent 
purchase (Tr. 72). He raised funds for this purchase from four sources. He borrowed 
$610,000 from the mortgage lender in SOR ¶ 1.a (AE D at 4, 5). He took out a second 
mortgage with another lender for $100,000 (Tr. 29; AE D at 3). He borrowed $50,000 on 
a line of credit secured to another home in California that he has owned since 1991 
(hereinafter 1991 home) (AE D at 4). He used $5,000 from a personal savings account. 
He lived in home R from January 2005 to October 2007 (Tr. 32). There was a fire in the 
close vicinity to home R in 2007, which burned several nearby homes (Tr. 32). In 
November 2007, Applicant moved back into his 1991 home. From November 2007 to 
November 2008, Applicant rented home R to a neighbor who lost his home in the fire 
(Tr. 32). The monthly rent he received for home R from November 2007 to November 
2008 was $4,000 (Tr. 33). The monthly mortgage payments and association fees on 
home R were about $4,700 (Tr. 33-34). Applicant hoped and believed the renters might 
purchase home R; however, they did not purchase home R and instead chose to rebuild 
their home (Tr. 34).  
 
After November 2008, home R was vacant, and Applicant stopped making his 
mortgage payments (Tr. 35). By February 2009, the first mortgage was delinquent 
$17,708 (AE D at 4). Eventually the first mortgage fell behind approximately $53,901, 
and home R went into foreclosure on November 30, 2009 (Tr. 67; AE D at 4). While 
home R was vacant, Applicant paid the utilities, water, maintenance of the yard, and 
homeowners association fees (Tr. 37). These costs were about $600 per month (Tr. 37-
38).3 
 
2 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the facts in this paragraph is Applicant’s June 30, 2009, 
statement (GE 2).  
 
3 At the hearing, Applicant was not asked about the real estate taxes and insurance on home R. 
However, I assume he paid these debts, as they do not appear on his credit report. These costs are 
probably substantial.

After November 2008, the most proposed rent for home R was about $2,200, 
which was less than half the amount of his monthly mortgage payments and expenses 
(Tr. 38). He did not rent home R after November 2008. Early in 2009, he listed home R 
with a realtor (Tr. 39). Early in 2009, the first mortgage company offered to reduce the 
monthly mortgage payment from $4,600 to $4,000 for six months; however, he did not 
accept this offer (Tr. 39). He had three offers to purchase home R at a price from 
$465,000 to $485,000 (Tr. 40). The first mortgage lender accepted a short sale at 
$486,000 with closing required by November 27, 2009 (Tr. 41). Although the second 
mortgage lender agreed not to object to the short sale, the second mortgage lender was 
expressly authorized to pursue a deficiency judgment (Tr. 42). One offer was submitted 
before the deadline, and then the purchaser withdrew the offer at the last minute 
because their child broke out in hives after they were at home R (Tr. 42). The first 
mortgage lender promised to extend the deadline until November 30, 2009 (Tr. 44). 
Applicant and his realtor submitted another offer for $474,000 on November 30, 2009; 
however, the employee at the first mortgage lender was gone, and another employee 
did not accept the offer because it was past the deadline (Tr. 40, 43-44; AE G). The first 
mortgage lender put home R into foreclosure on or about December 1, 2009 (Tr. 45). 
Home R sold in foreclosure for $418,123 (Tr. 47; AE K at 2). 
 
After the foreclosure, the first mortgage company informed Applicant he would 
not be pursued for additional funds (Tr. 48). A January 7, 2010, letter from the first 
mortgage creditor “confirm[ed] that [the creditor] will not pursue any deficiency balance 
associated with” Applicant’s loan (AE J at 3). The first mortgage creditor explained the 
“foreclosure has been completed .  .  .  and the account is considered settled” (AE J at 
3).    
 
Applicant said if it eventually turned out that he still owed the second mortgage 
creditor he would pay the debt (Tr. 72). He promised to immediately start a payment 
plan (Tr. 72). However, a January 6, 2010, letter from the second mortgage creditor 
stated the creditor will not pursue the deficiency (AE K at 2). The creditor notes a loss to 
the creditor of $105,188, but also states Applicant’s obligations to the creditor are 
concluded (AE K at 2).   
  
Applicant’s attorney discussed Applicant’s potential liability on the first and 
second mortgages on home R.4 He listed his qualifications, and indicated the first and 
second mortgages were used to purchase home R. The two loans were secured by 
deeds of trust. Neither loan was modified or rewritten after the purchase. On December 
7, 2009, the first mortgagor conducted a nonjudicial trustee’s public sale of the property. 
After the sale, the first mortgagor took title to the property, and extinguished the interest 
of the second mortgagor. Citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 580b and 
580d, lenders are forbidden from recovering deficiency judgments on purchase money 
 
4 AE M, a December 29, 2009, letter from Applicant’s attorney, is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph. A copy of California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 580b and 580d, are attached to his 
letter.

loans given to consumer borrowers to purchase personal dwellings. Thus, the creditors 
cannot attempt to collect from Applicant, and if they did so, he could seek damages in a 
civil action.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c (mortgage debt—$1,000) PAYMENT PLAN, RESOLVED. Applicant 
purchased the home D for $150,000 and it is probably worth about $250,000 now (Tr. 
27). The home D has been rented since November 2008, when Applicant moved to 
state A (Tr. 27). His rent is $1,900 monthly (Tr. 27). On August 20, 2009, Applicant’s 
principal balance owed to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c was $323,406 (AE C at 4; AE D at 
4). His monthly payment to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c is $1,640 (AE C at 2). An October 
13, 2009, letter from the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c notes one payment 30 days late in the 
last 24 months (AE C at 1). The creditor wrote the credit reporting companies and 
requested removal of the 30-day-late derogatory information from Applicant’s credit 
report (AE C at 1). Applicant also borrowed $50,000 secured by his 1991 home, which 
he applied as part of the funding used to purchase home R (Tr. 29; GE 5 at 7; AE D at 
4). Both of his mortgages on his home D are current, including his $50,000 second 
mortgage (Tr. 29, 58; GE 5 at 7; AE D at 4). Both mortgages are paid using an 
automatic payment from his account (Tr. 54; AE C at 2).  
 
Applicant’s monthly gross pay is $9,216, and his monthly net pay is $5,784 (Tr. 
53, 56; GE 2 at 14). He deposits $920 a month into his 401(k) plan (Tr. 53). His monthly 
expenses are $3,330, and his monthly debt payments are $854 (Tr. 56). He is making 
payments on a $2,500 loan, and he took out a signature loan to repay a loan from his 
401(k) account (Tr. 55). His remainder is about $1,600 (Tr. 56).  He has approximately 
$185,000 in his 401(k) account (Tr. 57). He does not have any deficiencies or 
delinquent accounts (Tr. 57). He borrowed $2,500 against his 401(k) and he is not able 
to borrow any more money using his 401(k) as security (Tr. 57). His vehicle loan with a 
high balance of $13,000 shows “pays as agreed”(Tr. 63; AE D at 4). A $30,000 line of 
credit was “paid as agreed” and closed in 2004 (AE D at 5). Other accounts in his credit 
reports, except the three listed in the SOR, show a history of “paying as agreed” and a 
zero balance (Tr. 63; AE D). 
 
On December 20, 2009, Applicant completed financial counseling (AE L). He 
also generated a budget. The information in this budget is similar to the one discussed 
in the previous paragraph (AE L). His net monthly pay, after deduction of expenses and 
debt payments, leaves a surplus of $935 (AE L at 5). 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant provided letters from three character references, who have known him 
collectively for many years (AE E 1-3). They describe him as honest, dedicated, loyal, 
and responsible. He is a consummate professional.  He has solid integrity and ethics. 
 
 The record evidence includes three certificates of extraordinary contribution and 
outstanding performance, which were issued by Applicant’s employer (AE E at 4-6). 
These three certificates are dated December 11, 2009, November 25, 2009, and 
October 30, 2009.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The administrative judge’s decision to grant a clearance is not a final decision 
unless the parties choose not to appeal. See Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 to E3.1.39. The 
DOHA Appeal Board5 may reverse the administrative judge’s “decision to grant, deny, 
or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.” ISCR 
Case No. 07-16511 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing Directive ¶¶ E3.1.32.3 and 
E3.1.33.3.).6 The federal courts generally limit appeals to whether or not the agency 
complied with its own regulations.7   
 
5Fact finding and credibility determinations are reserved exclusively for the administrative judge 
who is in a position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. See See, 36 F.3d at 382 (citations 
omitted). The Appeal Board has noted that it does not make “de novo findings of fact.” ISCR Case No. 
08-06058 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009). Appeal Boards and federal courts review the administrative 
judges’ factual determinations to ensure they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. See 
See, 36 F.3d at 382  Id.; Dehue Coal Company v. Ballard, 65 F.3d 1189, 1193-1194 (4th Cir. 1995). 
Review authorities defer to the administrative judges’ credibility determinations and inferences from the 
evidence. Id. The federal courts review Appeal Board decisions without giving deference to the factual 
findings of the Appeal Board. See See, 36 F.3d at 380 (citations omitted). The Appeal Board cannot 
“substitute its own fact findings and judgment for” those of the administrative judge. Id. at 382. In 2005, 
the Second Circuit cogently articulated how appellate authorities resolve errors Immigration Judges make 
at the hearing level. In Lin v. DoJ, 428 F.3d 391, 395 (2nd Cir. 2005), the court explained that in the 
resolution of error, an appellate authority is required to:  
 
(1) defer to the IJ’s fact-finding and affirm [the hearing judge’s decision] when the fact-
finding is based on specific and cogent reasons not infected by legal error; (2) remand 
where identified errors leave [the appellate authority] in doubt whether the IJ would have 
reached the same result absent the errors; (3) affirm, despite IJ errors, when the 
[appellate authority] can confidently predict that the IJ would necessarily reach the same 
result absent errors; and (4) grant the [appeal of the hearing judge’s decision] only in 
those extremely rare instances where substantial evidence does not exist to support the 
IJ’s decision. 
 
Judge White’s dissenting opinion explains why credibility determinations and ultimately the 
decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes such 
determinations. See ISCR Case No. 05-01820 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006). See also ISCR Case No. 
04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal 
Board’s authority to reverse hearing-level judicial decisions and recommending remand as a remedy to 
resolve material, prejudicial error). See also FCC v. Allentown, 349 U.S. 358, 364 (1955). 
  
6Although the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) does not apply to security clearance 
determinations, the “arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law” standard is derived from the APA. See 
Webster v. DOE, 486 U.S. 592, 598 n.5 (1988) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). See also United States v. 
Gregory, 534 U.S. 1, 6-8 (2001) (noting the standard for Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. § 
7703 is the same as for the APA and describing the standard as “extremely narrow” and limited to 
determining whether “minimal standards set forth in statute” are met).

Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
   
  AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” “It 
is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the 
substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations under [Directive] ¶ 
E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish 
either that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.” 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) (internal citation omitted). 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his response 
to DOHA interrogatories, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
  On May 24, 1996, Applicant discharged about $6,500 in delinquent debt using 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In November 2008, he stopped making his mortgage 
payments on home R, generating about $4,600 in delinquent debt every month until the 
first mortgage holder filed for foreclosure in November 2009. The government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
 
   
 
 
7 See El-Ganayni v. DOE, 2010 U.S. App. Lexis 548 (3d Cir. Oct. 28, 2009) (limiting constitutional 
challenges to a security clearance determination because merits of an agency’s security clearance 
decision are not reviewable); Makky v. Chertoff, 541 F.3d 205, 212 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Egan and stating 
that “there is no judicial review of the merits of a security clearance decision”). However, federal courts 
will review an agency decision to ensure compliance with agency regulations. Id. at 212-213 (citing 
Stehney v. Perry, 101 F.3d 925, 932 (3d Cir. 1996)). Here the controlling “regulation” is the Directive and 
Executive Order cited at page 1, supra. The controlling standard of review of administrative judicial 
decisions is “arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.” Directive ¶¶ E3.1.32.3.

Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence because he had two large delinquent debts from 
November 2008 until December 2009. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant 
does not receive credit under AG ¶ 20(a) even though he established that his financial 
problems “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” 
Applicant has resolved his delinquent SOR debts, and is unlikely to have delinquent 
debt in the future.   
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by the 
severe decline in home values in California from 2007 to 2009, which is akin to a 
“business downturn.” In January 2005, Applicant purchased home R for $765,000. He 
had an appraisal, which showed a market value of $785,000. As such, it was a 
reasonable and prudent purchase. He borrowed $710,000 secured by home R. He 
borrowed $50,000 on his other home, and used $5,000 from a personal savings 
account. From November 2007 to November 2008, he rented home R for $4,000 a 
month. However, he had a negative cash flow of about $600 per month of mortgage 
interest as well as substantial state real estate taxes and home owner’s insurance 
expenses.     
 
In November 2008, Applicant moved to a different state to be closer to his son’s 
family and for a less stressful working environment; however, he was unable to rent 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
home R for even half of his mortgage payments. In November 2008, he stopped paying 
the mortgages on home R, and began generating $4,600 per month in delinquent debt. 
He paid for maintenance, landscaping, utilities, and gardening, and had a negative cash 
flow of about $600 per month. He continued to be responsible for substantial state real 
estate taxes and home owner’s insurance expenses. He worked on securing short sales 
for almost a year, and had three written offers. If the first mortgagor had acted 
reasonably and appropriately, the first mortgagor would have saved $56,000 by 
accepting the November 30, 2009, offer for $474,000, and Applicant would still owe the 
second mortgagor $105,000.  
 
Once home R had gone into foreclosure, Applicant had no reasonable options 
and could only wait for the foreclosure process to be completed. Applicant has provided 
ample evidence to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with 
respect to his three SOR debts. He did not have sufficient financial resources to keep 
home R out of foreclosure because the rent plus his surplus income was insufficient to 
make the payments on the two mortgages. He has maintained contact with his creditors 
and attempted to work with them to resolve the mortgages.8 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) applies. Applicant received financial counseling. Applicant has 
established that “the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has resolved all 
of his SOR debts. All of his payment plans are established, current, and his credit 
reports have indicated they are in “pays as agreed” status. The two mortgages in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are resolved. Although the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b have lost 
$229,000 and $105,000 respectively, they cannot seek payment from Applicant under 
California law.9 He has generated a reasonable budget. He also established some 
 
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
9 As Applicant’s attorney indicates, under California law, there is a provision called the Anti-
Deficiency Statute, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 580(b, which states in relevant part: 
  
No deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property or an estate for 
years therein for failure of the purchaser to complete his or her contract of sale, or under 
a deed of trust or mortgage given to the vendor to secure payment of the balance of the 
purchase price of that real property or estate for years therein, or under a deed of trust or 
mortgage on a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure 
repayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the purchase price of that 
dwelling occupied, entirely or in part, by the purchaser. 
 
Under this section, generally if there is a foreclosure on a dwelling and there is a deficiency, the lender 
has no recourse regarding “purchase money loans,” also called “non-recourse loans,” the amounts set 
forth in both the 1st and the 2nd mortgages used to finance the dwelling purchase. The collateral or 
dwelling is considered full satisfaction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09662 at 9 (AJ Feb. 26, 2009) 
(quoting same provision to mitigate substantial mortgage debts—it is noted hearing-level decisions are 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed some good faith10 in the resolution of 
his SOR debts by admitting responsibility for his SOR debts.  
 
In sum, Applicant showed exceptional diligence and efforts to resolve his 
delinquent SOR debts. He took every reasonable, responsible action to mitigate the 
losses of the mortgage lenders in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Those two debts have been 
resolved through foreclosure, and Applicant has no legal obligation to pay any additional 
funds to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. The creditors have confirmed he has no 
obligation to pay them any more funds, and these two large debts are settled or 
resolved.   
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
 
persuasive but non-precedential); ISCR Case No. 08-03024 at 10-12 (AJ Apr. 28, 2009) (same result—
different state).  
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
insufficient to support revocation of his security clearance; however, they do warrant re-
weighing under the whole person concept. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not 
prudent or responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. On May 24, 1996, 
about $6,500 of Applicant’s delinquent debt was discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. In November 2008, he stopped making his mortgage payments on 
home R, and began generating $4,600 monthly in delinquent debt. In November 2009, 
he owed about $752,000 on his two home R mortgages ($647,000 on his 1st mortgage 
and $105,000 on his 2nd mortgage). 
 
 The rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is more persuasive. In January 
2005, Applicant purchased home R for $765,000. Based on an appraisal, which showed 
a value of $785,000, his purchase of home R was a reasonable and prudent purchase 
and investment. He borrowed $710,000 secured by home R, which is an indication the 
creditors agreed the purchase price was reasonable. In November 2008, he moved to a 
different state to be closer to his son’s family and for less stressful employment. By 
then, there was a substantial decline in the fair market value of home R. He wanted to 
retain home R until real estate prices recovered. By November 2008, he had paid the 
difference between his $4,000 monthly rent and his $4,700 monthly mortgage payments 
(not including his real estate taxes and insurance) for 12 months. After November 2008, 
he was unable to rent it for even half of his mortgage payments. He worked on short 
sales with a realtor for almost a year, and had three written offers. He continued to pay 
for utilities, taxes, maintenance, gardening, and insurance from November 2008 to 
2009, as he attempted to avoid foreclosure.  
 
 The first mortgagor on home R did not act reasonably and appropriately. On 
November 30, 2009, the first mortgagor had an offer for $474,000. The first mortgagor 
failed to process this offer, which would have saved the first mortgagor $56,000. If this 
short sale had been approved, Applicant would still owe the second mortgagor 
$105,000. Applicant aggressively pursued the November 30, 2009, short sale in lieu of 
the foreclosure because he believed he might lose his security clearance if home R was 
foreclosed. Once home R had gone into foreclosure, Applicant had no reasonable 
options and could only wait for the foreclosure process to be completed. Applicant has 
established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to his three 
SOR debts. He did not have sufficient financial resources to keep home R out of 
foreclosure because the rent plus his surplus income was insufficient to make the 
payments on the two mortgages. He maintained contact with his creditors and 
attempted to work with them to resolve the mortgages without using foreclosure to avoid 
paying the two mortgages.   
 
 Applicant is 48 years old and sufficiently mature to understand and comply with 
his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for supporting the 
Department of Defense as an employee of a defense contractor. He provided three 
letters of support and three certificates of commendation issued by his current 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
employer. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the Department 
of Defense, and his employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses 
illegal drugs. He has never been fired from a job or left employment under adverse 
circumstances. He has no reportable criminal offenses. These factors show substantial 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as 
set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration 
of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent 
factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities 
under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For 
the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
