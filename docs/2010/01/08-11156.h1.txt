FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on August 2, 2007. On July 
27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, 
citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 7, 2009; answered it on September 9, 
2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed on September 28, 2009, and the case was assigned to an 
 
2 
 
 
administrative judge on October 2, 2009. It was reassigned to me on October 16, 2009, 
to consolidate the docket. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 27, 2009, 
scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through O, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until December 4, 2009, to enable 
Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX P, Q, and 
R, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding 
AX P, Q, and R are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) on December 1, 2009. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f, 
1.m, 1.v, 1.w, 1.x, 1.ab, and 1.ac. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are 
incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old radiological control technician employed by a defense 
contractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2007. He enlisted in 
the Army National Guard in April 1988, and he has continued his service in the National 
Guard until the present (GX 2 at 17). He has held a security clearance since August 
1988.  
 
Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge on January 9, 1996 (GX 9). 
This bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ac.  
 
 Applicant was married in December 1995 and divorced in June 2007. He has a 
12-year-old daughter born during that marriage. He paid child support and spousal 
support totaling almost $1,000 per month until April 2009 (Tr. 135), when he was 
granted custody of his daughter (AX H at 1). His ex-wife is now obligated to pay $300 
per month in child support, but she has not paid it (Tr. 119).  
 
Applicant has remarried, and his current spouse is expecting the birth of twins in 
early 2010 (Tr. 43). His spouse had about $100,000 in debts, mostly for medical 
expenses, when they were married about three years ago. The medical expenses arose 
about a year before Applicant met his current spouse, as a result of her giving birth to 
three babies who died at birth (Tr. 25). 
 
Applicant graduated from a state police academy and completed an associate’s 
degree program in 1997 and 1998. He received a certificate of appreciation for his 
contributions to a state counter-drug procurement program in January 1999 (AX E). He 
earned a bachelor’s degree in October 2000 (AX C). In March 2004, he was appointed 
as a special advocate for abused and neglected children by the juvenile and domestic 
family relations court for his community (AX D). He received a master’s degree in 
business administration in 2007 and a master’s degree in management in 2009 (AX A; 
 
3 
 
 
AX B; Tr. 43). He has about $70,000 in student loans, on which payment is deferred (Tr. 
132).  
 
In 2002, after Applicant was released from a period of active duty with the 
National Guard, he received unemployment benefits. After three months he found 
employment, but he continued to collect unemployment benefits because he needed the 
money. In June 2002, he was charged with filing a false statement for unemployment 
benefits. The charge was dismissed after he paid restitution of about $1,300 (GX 2 at 
13, 23-24; Tr. 101-02). 
 
Applicant worked at a naval shipyard as a radiation monitor from March 2001 to 
September 2004. Between October 2004 and April 2007, he worked at 17 different 
nuclear power plants in seven different states (AX A; Tr. 24). His security clearance 
application reflects unemployment from June to November 2005, March to October 
2006, December 2006 to February 2007, and April to August 2007. 
 
During an interview with a security investigator in September 2007, Applicant 
attributed his financial problems to mismanagement and spending more than he earned 
(GX 2 at 7). He admitted most of the delinquent debts reflected on his credit reports, 
including the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, and 1.v (GX 2 at 8-
11). He later denied these debts in his answer to the SOR.  
 
 Applicant testified that many of his delinquent debts arose between 2004 and 
2007, when he was moving frequently and not receiving his mail (Tr. 24). He also 
incurred about $10,000 in legal expenses to gain custody of his daughter (Tr. 25, 160).  
 
Applicant denied the debt for cell phone service alleged in SOR ¶ 1.v. He 
testified he contacted the service provider and was informed that they had no 
information on the debt and could not explain why it was listed in his credit report (Tr. 
86). He presented no documentary proof of his contact with the service provider. He has 
not submitted written disputes of this debt or any of the debts alleged in the SOR to the 
credit reporting agencies (Tr. 83, 87). 
 
The federal income tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.aa includes the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.p, for which a tax lien was imposed and later satisfied (AX F at 2; Tr. 73). 
Applicant testified he filed his tax returns every year, but for several years the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) recalculated his taxes to be a greater amount. For some years, 
insufficient taxes were withheld from his pay, resulting in taxes due that were more than 
he could afford to pay when he filed his returns (Tr. 76).  
 
Applicant estimates he currently owes the IRS about $2,000 (Tr. 25). He has 
negotiated a payment agreement providing for $100 payments each month beginning in 
November 2009. He also has an additional $300 withheld from his pay each pay period 
so that he will accumulate a tax overpayment sufficient to pay off the tax debt when he 
files his income tax return for tax year 2009 (Tr. 71-72, 78; AX F at 4). 
 
4 
 
 
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on May 15, 2009 (GX 10 at 1). 
This petition is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ad. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.o, 1.q, 1.s-
1.u, 1.w, and 1.x are included in the bankruptcy. He received a discharge in August 
2009 (AX N at 1; AX O at 2; Tr. 24).

 Applicant has attended money management seminars offered by his credit union, 
and he completed a budget and credit management course in February 2009 (GX 2 at 
17, 33; Tr. 130-31). He was required to obtain debt counseling when he filed his most 
recent bankruptcy petition. 
 
 In a personal financial statement submitted in response to DOHA interrogatories 
on May 4, 2009, Applicant reported net family income of $4,284, expenses of $2,735, 
debt payments of $67, and a net monthly remainder of $1,482. His net family income 
included his spouse’s net salary of about $1,200. His spouse was injured in an 
automobile accident and was unable to work from December 2008 until May 2009 (GX 
2 at 5; AX G). She returned to work but was laid off in July 2009. At the time of the 
hearing, she was unable to work outside the home because of her pregnancy (Tr. 133).  
 
 In his bankruptcy petition filed on May 15, 2009, Applicant reported average 
monthly income of $5,309, and expenses of $5,509, leaving a monthly shortfall of $200 
(GX 10 at 75). He reported net assets of $16,216 and liabilities of $202,950 (GX 10 at 
10). He testified that the actual amount of debts discharged was considerably lower 
than shown on his schedule of creditors, because several debts listed were duplicates 
and his listing of debts included his delinquent federal taxes and about $70,000 in 
student loans that were not dischargeable (Tr. 106).  
 
In his post-hearing submission, Applicant reported that his actual net family 
income and expenditures for November 2009 were $3,726. The expenditures include 
savings of $70 and a $50 payment to a prepaid college fund for his daughter (AX H at 4; 
AX Q). 
 
Applicant owns a 14-year-old car and an 8-year-old van, and the loans for both 
have been paid in full (Tr. 125). He does not own a home, but he and his wife have 
purchased a $3,000 vacation time share, on which the monthly payments are $67 (Tr. 
127). He has about $2,000 in savings and $1,989 in his retirement account (Tr. 130).  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
 
6 
 
 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges 27 delinquent debts totaling about $34,420 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.aa). 
It also alleges an arrest for filing a false statement for unemployment benefits (SOR ¶¶ 
1.ab), and two Chapter 7 bankruptcies (SOR ¶¶ 1.ac and 1.ad). 
 
 
7 
 
 
The federal tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p is included in the debt alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.aa. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, 
one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in the applicant=s favor. See ISCR 
Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). 
Accordingly, I will resolve the SOR ¶ 1.p for Applicant.  
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Several disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG ¶ 19(a) is 
raised by an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” AG ¶ 19(c) is raised by “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” AG ¶ 19(d) is raised by “deceptive or illegal 
financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax 
evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional 
financial breaches of trust.” AG ¶ 19(e) is raised by “consistent spending beyond one=s 
means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash 
flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.” The evidence and 
Applicant’s admissions raise all four disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to him 
to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has 
the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts 
to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   
 
Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established for Appellant’s delinquent debts, because his delinquent 
debts are numerous, not yet resolved, and did not occur under circumstances that make 
them unlikely to recur. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is also relevant to Applicant’s arrest for filing a false statement in 
connection with his receipt of unemployment benefits in 2001. It happened more than 
seven years ago, and it was a single act of misconduct that has not recurred. He 
promptly made restitution. On the other hand, it did not occur under circumstances 
making it unlikely to recur. Applicant was a mature adult at the time of the misconduct. 
He has continued to demonstrate financial irresponsibility. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(a) is 
not established for the conduct alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ab.  
 
 
8 
 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that ‘the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Applicant encountered several circumstances 
beyond his control. He had periodic periods of unemployment, a marital break-up, and 
an expensive custody battle. His spouse’s recent automobile accident and inability to 
work reduced the family income. On the other hand, many of his debts arose before his 
marital break-up and before his spouse’s injury. He has not acted responsibly. He has 
been continuously employed since August 2007, but he chose not to resolve most of his 
delinquent debts, in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy. Several of the debts were small: 
$18 (¶ 1.g), $60 (¶ 1.j), $81 (¶ 1.l), $44 (¶ 1.n), $91 (¶ 1.u), and $140 (¶ 1.w); and they 
could have been paid while his spouse was working. He admitted to a security 
investigator that his financial problems arose because of his mismanagement and 
overspending. I conclude AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). This 
mitigating condition is established because Applicant has received counseling and his 
financial problems are under control. Whether they are likely to remain under control is 
a separate issue addressed below. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established for the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.y, because it 
was resolved by garnishment of Applicant’s pay and not by any voluntary act on his 
part. It also is not established for the debts discharged in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a 
lawful, legitimate means of resolving delinquent debts, and it can ameliorate the security 
concern about resorting to unlawful means to obtain funds. However, it does not 
constitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of this guideline.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.p, 1.r, 1.z, and 1.aa. 
Applicant has paid the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.r and he is executing 
reasonable payment plans for the federal tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.aa and 
the judgment alleged in ¶ 1.z.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). Applicant 
admitted the cell phone debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.v when he was interviewed by a 
 
9 
 
 
security investigator in September 2007, but he disputed it in his answer to the SOR 
and at the hearing. The basis for his dispute is that he has never had a contract with the 
provider. AG ¶ 20(e) is not established, however, because he has not provided any 
documentary proof that he has presented his dispute to the creditor or the credit 
reporting agencies. 
 
Conditional Clearance 
 
 During his closing statement, Applicant suggested the possibility of being granted 
a conditional clearance for a year to allow him to demonstrate his financial responsibility 
(Tr. 161). I cannot adopt his suggestion, because I do not have authority to grant a 
conditional or interim clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. 
Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He was articulate and he seemed 
sincere at the hearing. He has held a security clearance for many years, apparently 
without incident. He has supported national defense, doing dangerous work, for many 
years. On the other hand, he has demonstrated financial irresponsibility for almost 15 
years. Although his most recent bankruptcy discharge significantly reduces the financial 
pressure on him, he has not fully satisfied his federal tax debt or the judgment that 
arose from his auto accident. He recently assumed responsibility for his daughter and is 
about to become the father of twins. He has about $70,000 in student loans that 
eventually must be repaid. His current budget provides virtually no discretionary funds. 
He has meager savings available for unexpected financial emergencies.  
 
10 
 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.o:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.p:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.q:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.r:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.s-1.y:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.z-1.aa:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.ab-1.ad:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
