HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 20 delinquent debts, totaling 
$41,117. He admitted responsibility for 13 SOR debts, totaling $23,525. He was making 
his child support payments because his pay was being garnished, and he allocated his 
2008 income tax refund to reduce his child support debt. One of the 12 remaining SOR 
debts duplicated another SOR debt. He did not make any payments on the other 11 
SOR debts, which totaled $14,402. He did not take sufficient actions to address or 
resolve his SOR debts. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated, and 
eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 28, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
August 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On October 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (HE 3). He requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. On October 27, 2009, Department Counsel 
indicated she was ready to proceed on his case. On October 29, 2009, DOHA assigned 
Applicant’s case to me. On November 4, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). 
On November 23, 2009, Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. 16-17), and Applicant offered seven exhibits 
(Tr. 19-21; AE A-G). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 17-18), and 
AE A-G (Tr. 22). Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the 
SOR (HE 1-3). On December 2, 2009, I received the transcript. I held the record open 
until December 20, 2009, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 
48-50, 85-88, 97, 99-100). On January 19, 2010, I received 11 exhibits from Applicant 
(AE H-R). Department Counsel did not object (HE 4), and AE H-R were admitted into 
evidence that same day.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted 13 debts, totaling $23,525 as follows: ¶¶ 1.a 
to 1.e, ¶ 1.g, ¶ 1.i, ¶ 1.l, and ¶¶ 1.p to 1.t (HE 2). He denied the remainder of his SOR 
debts without elaboration (HE 2).  
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old long-haul truck driver (Tr. 6, 23). He has been 
employed as a truck driver for about ten years (GE 1). Applicant graduated from high 
school in 1978 (Tr. 6). He attended a vocational technical school in welding and 
machine shop; however, he did not graduate (Tr. 7, 27). He served in the Army National 
Guard from June 1989 to October 2009 (Tr. 29, 58; GE 1). He will not receive a military 
retirement check until he is age 60.  
 
Applicant committed one security violation. He possessed a cell phone with a 
camera in his truck in a location where such a device was not permitted (Tr. 30). He 
also denied that he had the camera-phone, when actually he did have it in his truck (Tr. 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

30). He explained that the reason he denied that he had it was because it was turned off 
(Tr. 30). His employer suspended him from work for three months (Tr. 31).2  
 
Applicant held a secret or top secret clearance while he was in the Army (Tr. 28, 
31-32). He served in Iraq from March 2003 to October 2004 (GE 1). He retired in the 
grade of sergeant (AE M; GE 1). His DD Form 214 lists a variety of awards, training, 
and commendations including: an Army Achievement Medal, Meritorious Unit 
Commendation, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal (3rd Award), National 
Defense Service Medal (2nd Award), Southwest Asia Service Medal with Bronze Service 
Star (2nd Award), Army Service Ribbon, Army Reserve Component Overseas Training 
Ribbon (3rd Award), Armed Forces Reserve Medal w/M Device (3rd Award), Kuwait 
Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia), Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait), Global War on 
Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (AE M). 
 
Applicant was married from 1986 to 2005, and he was previously married for 15 
months (GE 1). On December 15, 2005, he married his current spouse (Tr. 23). 
Applicant is planning to obtain a divorce (Tr. 24). His children are ages 15, 21, and 31 
(Tr. 24-25; GE 1). 
 
On August 15, 2009, Applicant’s security clearance was suspended, and he 
became unemployed (Tr. 23). His wife is a truck driver, and she became unemployed in 
October 2009 (Tr. 43, 91). His spouse has not yet started to receive unemployment 
compensation (Tr. 66). They do not have sufficient income to address their daily living 
expenses and his SOR debts (Tr. 67-81). Their first and second mortgages, totaling 
about $1,000 per month, are about three months behind (Tr. 74). Applicant is not 
responsible for either of these mortgages (Tr. 76).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed 20 delinquent debts totaling $41,117 as follows: ¶ 1.a 
(medical—$368); ¶ 1.b (gasoline expenses—$1,582); ¶ 1.c (collection—$174); ¶ 1.d 
(medical—$150); ¶ 1.e (collection—$3,947); ¶ 1.f (collection—$2,004); ¶ 1.g (child 
support—$8,973); ¶ 1.h (collection—$1,124); ¶ 1.i (collection—$1,235); ¶ 1.j 
(collection—$1,783); ¶ 1.k (collection—$3,466); ¶ 1.l (collection—$580); ¶ 1.m (bank—
$1,387); ¶ 1.n (bank—$6,260); ¶ 1.o (bank—$1,568); ¶ 1.p (department store—$1,296); 
¶ 1.q (collection—$1,046); ¶ 1.r (collection—$941); ¶ 1.s (medical—$537); and ¶ 1.t 
(collection—$2,669) (HE 2).  
 
Applicant asserted several debts were duplications and after the hearing 
provided the specific debts he thought were duplicated (Tr. 45, 48-50).  Applicant states 
that the following SOR debts are duplications of each other (AE H): 
 
(1) ¶ 1.f ($2,004) and ¶ 1.p ($1,296); 
 
 
2The SOR did not allege that this incident raised a security concern. No adverse inference is 
made against Applicant for this breach of security rules.

(2) ¶ 1.h ($1,124) and ¶ 1.r ($941); 
 
(3) ¶ 1.j ($1,783) and ¶ 1.q ($1,046); and 
 
(4) ¶ 1.k ($3,466) and ¶ 1.t ($2,669). 
 
Applicant believed the six debts totaling $11,332 in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($2,004), 1.h 
($1,124), 1.j ($1,783), 1.k ($3,466); 1.m ($1,387), and ¶ 1.o ($1,568) were debts from 
credit cards where his former spouse was the primary user and Applicant was merely 
an authorized user (Tr. 35-36, 42, 44-46, 48). He has not communicated with these six 
creditors (Tr. 36). His divorce papers do not expressly and specifically allocate 
responsibility for any of these six credit card accounts, and it is unclear whether these 
delinquent debts were allocated to her or whether Applicant is still liable for some or all 
of the debts (Tr. 37, 63-64; AE P at ¶ 6.H). In some instances, he disputed the amount 
of the debts on his credit reports, and the disputes were noted on his credit reports (Tr. 
38). I conclude Applicant had a good faith, albeit erroneous belief that he was not legally 
responsible for these six debts.3   
 
Applicant’s spouse owns the house where he currently lives (Tr. 26). His name is 
not on the deed (Tr. 26). They are behind on their house payments, and Applicant 
believes they will catch up on their house payments and then file for divorce in January 
or February 2010 (Tr. 46). Applicant wanted to bring his spouse’s mortgages to current 
status because he wanted to have a peaceful divorce (Tr. 79-80).  
 
Applicant planned to start paying his delinquent debts beginning with his smaller 
debts once he received employment (Tr. 33-34). He contacted the medical creditors in 
SOR ¶ 1.a and 1.s in August and September 2009 (Tr. 32, 34, 52).  He believed the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d were the same debt because they were listed as owed to 
the same creditor (Tr. 34). The amounts of the debts in ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d are within $25 of 
each other. He has not been in communication with the creditors for the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.b, 1.i, 1.l, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.t (Tr. 34, 43-46, 50-53).  
 
Applicant denied knowledge and responsibility for the bank debt in SOR ¶ 1.n 
($6,260) (Tr. 47). His credit report indicates the credit card was lost or stolen (Tr. 47; GE 
4 at 12).4  
 
Applicant’s April 15, 2008, credit report shows a past due child support balance 
of $11,162 (GE 4 at 12). His monthly child support payment is $400 (Tr. 40, 72). He 
believed the child support debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($8,973) was reduced to about $6,000 
when Applicant paid $2,871 of his federal tax refund towards his child support debt (Tr. 
39; AE A at 3). He provided a spreadsheet indicating his federal tax refund went to 
reduce his child support debt (Tr. 41-42; AE J at lines 20, 23, and 31). His pay records

10, infra.

for January 1, 2009, to August 14, 2009, show a total child support garnishment of 
$2,585 (AE Q at 23). When Applicant became unemployed in August 2009, his spouse 
only made a partial payment on his child support debt (Tr. 72). 
 
Applicant’s spouse is the person in the household who pays their debts (Tr. 40). 
Applicant explained why he believed he was unable to resolve his SOR debts: 
 
I make the money, I hand the money over to her and she pays the bills, 
and I’m at her mercy as of getting some of these bills paid, but once I get 
away from her, it will be just my responsibility to get them paid and I will 
make sure that they do get paid .  .  . Once I get away from my current 
wife, yes, I will have a budget.5    
 
Applicant contended his financial problems began in 2004 when his Army active 
duty orders were not extended (Tr. 53-54). From June to November 2005, he was on 
active duty, and his net income was about $5,000 per month (Tr. 61-62). He was 
unemployed until he could obtain post-active duty employment (Tr. 54). When he was 
previously married, he and his wife used debt consolidation plans to resolve their debts 
(Tr. 55). However, Applicant’s current wife refused to utilize a debt consolidation plan 
(Tr. 55). Applicant has not received financial counseling; however, he is willing to 
undertake financial counseling after they file for divorce (Tr. 56). 
  
When Applicant was in Iraq (March 2003 to October 2004), he earned about 
$4,000 per month tax free (Tr. 63). His former wife used the money while he was in 
combat for her own purchases and expenses (Tr. 63). In 2006, Applicant’s gross 
income was about $38,000, and in 2007, it was about 40,000 (Tr. 61). He and his 
current wife’s joint income in 2006 was $81,351 (AE N at 2). Their joint income in 2007 
was $92,601 (AE O at 2). In 2008, Applicant’s gross income was $43,000 (Tr. 60; AE 
A).6 From January 1, 2009 to August 14, 2009, Applicant earned $21,517 from his 
civilian employment and $3,017 from the Army National Guard (AE L at 8; AE Q at 23). 
He was unemployed after August 15, 2009 (Tr. 60). Starting in October 2009, he began 
receiving monthly unemployment compensation of $1,060 (Tr. 60). Applicant and his 
spouse’s living expenses are about $1,700 per month (Tr. 78). Applicant does not have 
any savings or investments (Tr. 79).  
 
In sum, the only payments made on any of Applicant’s SOR debts were 
payments on his child support debt (Tr. 86). I asked Applicant to provide documentation 
showing some SOR debts were duplicated by other SOR debts (Tr. 48-49) and proof of 
any payments on any SOR debts (Tr. 97). Applicant provided some post-hearing 
documentation addressing some other questions; however, he did not provide any 
documents from creditors showing debts were duplicated or that he made any 
payments on any SOR debts, aside from his child support payments. He did not provide 
                                            
5 Tr. 56-57. 
 
6There is no record evidence showing Applicant’s spouse’s income in 2008 and 2009.

any correspondence to or from his other SOR creditors concerning his efforts to pay, 
establish payment plans, or otherwise resolve his delinquent SOR debts.    
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” “It 
is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the 
substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations under [Directive] ¶ 
E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish 
either that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.” 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) (internal citation omitted). 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR 
response, and his statement at his hearing. Many of his SOR debts have been 
delinquent for a substantial period of time. In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he 
admitted 13 debts, totaling $23,525 as follows: ¶¶ 1.a to 1.e, ¶ 1.g, ¶ 1.i, ¶ 1.l, and ¶¶ 
1.p to 1.t. Applicant’s pay was being garnished to satisfy his child support debt in SOR ¶ 
1.g. Although he receives limited mitigating credit for involuntarily paying his child 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
support through garnishment,7 this debt is mitigated because he allocated his 2008 
income tax refund to reduction of his child support debt, in addition to the pay that was 
being garnished.  
 Applicant did not provide any evidence of resolution on the other 12 SOR debts 
that he admitted. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent 
SOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.

debts through garnishment is not necessarily mitigating).

AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by 
unemployment, divorce, and his current spouse’s unwillingness to allocate more of 
Applicant’s salary to address his debts. However, he has not provided sufficient 
evidence to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to 
his unresolved SOR debts. He knew that his spouse was allocating less than a fair and 
appropriate share of his salary for his debts, and he did not take action to address these 
financial issues. Instead, he is going to wait for their divorce, and then to be rehired to 
begin making payments to his SOR creditors. From January 2006 to August 14, 2009, 
his income gradually increased or remained about the same. He had sufficient financial 
resources to begin a payment plan to address some of his smaller debts and loans, and 
chose not to do so. He has not maintained contact with most of his creditors.8 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not receive financial 
counseling, he probably has otherwise learned about financial issues. Applicant cannot 
receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, started payment plans, 
disputed, or otherwise resolved 12 of his SOR debts. There are some initial, positive 
“indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has admitted his 
responsibility for 13 SOR debts. Although he has a payment plan on one debt through 
garnishment (SOR ¶ 1.g), he did not provide documentation showing any payments to 
any of the other 12 SOR creditors. He has not generated a budget and does not monitor 
expenses. He promised to eventually resolve his delinquent SOR debts.9 He also 
established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed some good faith10 in 
 
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
9 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting responsibility for 13 of his SOR debts, and 
by promising to resolve his delinquent SOR debts.  
 
Applicant believed the six debts totaling $11,332 in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($2,004), 1.h 
($1,124), 1.j ($1,783), 1.k ($3,466); 1.m ($1,387), and 1.o ($1,568) were debts from 
credit cards where his former spouse was the primary user and Applicant described 
himself as an authorized user. As an admitted authorized user of these credit accounts, 
Applicant is legally responsible for the debts on these accounts, unless he can show 
that he did not sign the contract with the creditors. Allocation of these debts to his 
former spouse through their divorce decree does not automatically release his liability to 
the creditors, unless the creditors were notified and given an opportunity to oppose the 
release of Applicant’s liability. None of his SOR creditors are specifically listed in the 
divorce decree and none of them signed it. Applicant’s remedy is to pay the joint debts 
in accordance with the contracts with the creditors, and then sue his former wife under 
the divorce decree. Nevertheless, I will mitigate these debts for purposes of this 
decision because Applicant was not aware that he had an obligation to pay these debts 
if his former spouse failed to do so.11 Moreover, Applicant alleged the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.f ($2,004), 1.h ($1,124), 1.j ($1,783), and 1.k ($3,466) were duplicated by debts he 
accepted responsibility for in his SOR response: ¶ 1.p ($1,296), ¶ 1.r ($941), ¶ 1.q 
($1,046), and ¶ 1.t ($2,669). I do not need to determine whether or not they are 
duplications, having mitigated the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k previously 
because Applicant was not aware of his responsibility to pay or otherwise resolve these 
debts. Accordingly, I will find “Against Applicant” on SOR ¶¶ 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.t 
because (1) he accepted responsibility for them in his SOR response, and the evidence 
of his former spouse’s responsibility for these four debts is not sufficiently established.   
  
Applicant denied knowledge and responsibility for the bank debt in SOR ¶ 1.n 
($6,260). His April 15, 2008, credit report indicates the credit card was lost or stolen. 
Applicant is credited with disputing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n, and it is mitigated under AG ¶ 
20(e). I also accept his contention that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d are duplications 
of each other, and SOR ¶ 1.d is mitigated.   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. In his SOR response, he admitted 13 
debts, totaling $23,525 as follows: ¶¶ 1.a to 1.e, ¶ 1.g, ¶ 1.i, ¶ 1.l, and ¶¶ 1.p to 1.t. The 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is mitigated as a duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. The debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.g is mitigated because he has an established payment plan. He has had 
steady employment from January 2006 to August 14, 2009, and he has not shown 
sufficient progress on the 11 unaddressed SOR debts. His steps are simply inadequate 
to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
 
 
 
 
11When Applicant receives this decision, he will have a better understanding of his obligation to 
resolve these debts, if his former spouse fails to pay them.

Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
  Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant is 51 years old, and he is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit 
for volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an employee of a defense 
contractor and as a truck driver for the U.S. Army in Iraq. There is every indication that 
he is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, and his employer. There is 
no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. He has never been fired from 
a job or left employment under adverse circumstances. His unemployment, divorce, and 
current marital difficulties concerning allocation of income to resolve debts contributed 
to his financial woes. He denied responsibility for seven SOR debts. He disputed the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.n. Applicant believed in good faith that his former wife was solely 
responsible for six SOR debts totaling $11,332. Applicant admitted responsibility for 13 
SOR debts. He has made payments on his largest SOR debt for child support through 
garnishment of his wages and his 2008 income tax refund. One debt was a duplication 
of another SOR debt. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. 
 
The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. In his SOR response, he 
admitted responsibility for 13 SOR debts. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d duplicated the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.c. He had been making payments on his child support debt (SOR ¶ 1.g) 
through garnishment. Eleven SOR debts totaling $14,402 are not adequately 
addressed. He had notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity to 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
contact his creditors. From January 1, 2006, through August 14, 2009, he was making 
approximately $3,000 per month. He had sufficient income to arrange payment plans on 
his SOR debts, or at least to establish and maintain communications with his SOR 
creditors after he received the SOR. He did not make adequate progress in the 
resolution of 11 of his SOR debts. He did not pay, start payments, dispute, or otherwise 
resolve 11 SOR debts. 
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on 
the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful 
consideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of 
the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my 
responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the 
government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d   For Applicant (duplicates 1.c) 
Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m to 1.o:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p to 1.t:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
