Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire on November 3, 2008. On 
August 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and 
effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On September 11, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 
19, 2009. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 20, 2009. 
The case was transferred to me on October 27, 2009. On November 5, 2009, a Notice 
of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 2009. The case was 
heard on that date. The government offered 10 exhibits which were admitted as 
Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 10. The government also provided a demonstrative 
exhibit which was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The Applicant testified, called one 
 
2 
 
 
witness, and offered two exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and 
B. The record was held open until December 3, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit 
additional documents.  He timely submitted a nine-page document that was admitted as 
AE C. Department Counsel’s response to AE C is marked as HE II. The transcript was 
received on December 1, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 
1.f. He denies SOR allegations 1.a, and 1.c.   
 
Applicant is a 63-year-old senior analyst employed with a Department of Defense 
contractor applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his company since 
November 1, 2008.  In 1963, he served in the National Guard. He served in the United 
States Army Reserve from 1964 to 1974. He held a Secret clearance from 1970 to 
1974. He separated with an Honorable Discharge in the grade of Captain. He has a four 
year college degree. He is single and has no children. (Tr at 5-6, 29-32; Gov 1)  
 
Applicant’s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has the 
following delinquent accounts: a $252 medical account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.a:  
Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 11); a $2,140 cell phone account placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 7 at 11; Gov 8 at 5); a $2,176 
medical account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 1; 
Gov 7 at 12) a $36,516 AMEX account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 4 at 3; 
Gov 5 at; Gov 7 at 15); a $15,287 AMEX account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 
4 at 2; Gov 5 at 6; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 5; Gov 8 at 4); and a $8,854 credit account that 
was charged off. (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 16; Gov 8 at 
4) 
 
Applicant began to have financial problems in 2002-2003. The company he 
worked for did not pay him during 2003. Previously, he earned $150,000 per year plus 
expenses. In 2003, his compensation was to increase to $500,000. He received no 
compensation in 2003. He continued to work for the company during the entire year 
because he thought the company would eventually pay him. He paid his living expenses 
by using credit cards, primarily the credit cards alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. He left 
the company in December 2003 when he realized that it was unlikely the company 
would pay him. He attempted to get paid by contacting his state. The state filed suit 
against Applicant’s former employer to obtain Applicant’s unpaid compensation. The 
suit was dropped after Applicant’s former employer filed bankruptcy in June 2006. (Tr at 
28, 32-38) 
 
Applicant had a ten week period of unemployment when he left a job in 
September 2008 for his current position. When he was initially hired in his current 
position, he believed that he would be paid $115,000 with travel allowances of $40,000,  
the same annual salary that he had been paid in his previous position. The government 
 
3 
 
 
contract official only approved an annual salary of $85,000. Applicant claims this 
reduced his compensation by $70,000 when the expenses were included. (Tr at 54, 84; 
Response to SOR) 
 
He has not been able to work on reducing additional debt because of his 
reduction in salary. About a month ago, he refinanced his mortgage. His mortgage 
payment has been reduced from $2,500 a month to $1,130 a month. He owns a home 
on the western side of the state where he lives. He drives home on the weekends and 
rents an apartment near the area where his job is located where he stays during the 
work week.  His net monthly income is currently $4,900. His monthly expenses include: 
a $1,130 mortgage; $450 apartment rent; $300 groceries; $100 clothing; $400 utilities; 
$500 for car insurance, car repairs and gas; $100 life insurance, and $250 
entertainment. He has approximately $1,670 left over each month after expenses to 
apply towards his debts. (Tr at 61-66, 74-75, 90-91)   
 
Applicant has resolved several debts, including some debts that were not 
included in the SOR.  He hopes to negotiate settlements for his unresolved debts in the 
future. (Tr at 73, 77-78; see also AE B at 2, 13-20) 
 
The current status of the debts alleged in the SOR are: 
 
1.a.  Medical account, $252: Paid on October 10, 2009. (AE B at 30)  
 
1.b. Cell phone account, $2,140, placed for collection: On September 25, 2009, 
Applicant and the collection company agreed to settle the account for $534.92. 
Applicant paid the settlement amount on September 29, 2009. (AE B at 27-29) 
 
1.c. $2,176 medical account placed for collection: On October 13, 2009, 
Applicant settled the account in the amount of $1,414.40. (AE B at 25-26) 
 
1.d. and 1.e. Charged off credit card accounts in the amounts of $36,516, and 
$15,287. Applicant believes the combined balance for both accounts is currently 
$82,645. Neither account has been paid. He stopped paying these accounts in late 
2002. Applicant hopes to resolve these accounts in the future. (Tr at 27, 39-41, 56, 72-
73; AE B at 2) 
 
1.f. $8,854 charged off credit card account: The collection agency agreed to a 
settlement amount of $1,576. Applicant paid the settlement amount on October 17, 
2009. Account was settled. (AE B at 23-24)  
 
In March 2006, Applicant entered and completed a 28-day alcohol treatment 
program. He has not consumed alcohol after completing treatment. He remains actively 
involved in counseling other alcoholics. From April 2006 to March 2009, he estimates 
that he has spent approximately $60,000 to help out other alcoholics. He reduced the 
financial payments in March 2009 because he had no money and the provided support 
did not have a positive effect on the individuals to whom he gave the money. He 
 
4 
 
 
currently spends about $500 a month helping other alcoholics but claims he is more 
cautious about how he provides support. (Tr at 51-52, 57-59) 
 
Applicant’s supervisor testified during the hearing. He has known Applicant for 
three years. Applicant worked for another company that interacted with Applicant’s 
current employer. Applicant asked the supervisor if there was a position available within 
their company. His former employer treated him poorly. Applicant’s supervisor was not 
able to hire the Applicant until the contract was awarded in late October 2008. The 
government would not agree to meet Applicant’s salary but offered him a salary at a 
reduced rate. Applicant had already left his previous company. The client is very happy 
with the work Applicant has performed. The supervisor works with Applicant on a daily 
basis. He is aware of Applicant’s past financial difficulties. (Tr at 79-91)  
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered 
in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
 
5 
 
 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant has had financial difficulties 
since 2002. The SOR alleged 6 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of 
$62,225.  
 
The government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has had financial problems for several years. While he resolved four of the six 
delinquent debts, he has not taken steps to resolve his two remaining delinquent 
 
6 
 
 
accounts. The balance on those two accounts now total $82,645. He has neglected 
these two accounts for over eight years. While Applicant testified that he intends to 
resolve these accounts in the future, he has taken little action to resolve the accounts. 
During the same time period that Applicant could have been working to resolve these 
two accounts, Applicant gave $60,000 to several members who attended his alcohol 
counseling meetings. While his desire to help others is commendable, it does not 
demonstrate the best judgment when one’s personal finances are neglected. Applicant’s 
unresolved debts raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.  
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies because Applicant’s 
employer did not pay him during 2003. However, it was within Applicant’s control to 
seek other employment earlier after his employer stopped paying him rather than 
continue to work and live off his credit cards for a year. The fact that the company filed 
bankruptcy before he could obtain a legal cause of action against them was not within 
his control as well. However, I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the 
circumstances because he has made little effort towards resolving the two credit card 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. even though he was gainfully employed for 
several years with a good salary. He chose to give the money that should have been 
used to resolve his delinquent accounts to several alcoholics who he met when they 
attended counseling. While his desire to help a person in need is admirable, he ignored 
his obligations to his creditors. Applicant has been financially irresponsible for a number 
of years. While circumstances beyond his control contributed to his financial problems 
and he recently resolved four of the six delinquent accounts, he has not acted 
responsibly with regards to resolving his two remaining delinquent accounts.   
 
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. His two largest 
accounts remain unresolved and Applicant has no plans to resolve these accounts in 
the immediate future.  
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) partially applies. He recently resolved the accounts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. He also resolved several delinquent accounts 
that were not alleged in the SOR. He recently refinanced his home which allowed him to 
negotiate settlements with four of his creditors. However, his two largest accounts 
remain unresolved. He neglected his finances while providing approximately $60,000 to 
fellow alcoholics from April 2006 to March 2009. While he has reduced the amount of 
money that he gives to his fellow alcoholics who are in need, the $500 he still spends to 
help needy alcoholics could be more effectively spent towards paying his delinquent 
debts, especially after learning the previous $60,000 spent was ineffective. This 
mitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant has not initiated a good-faith 
 
7 
 
 
effort towards resolving his largest debts that are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.  The 
current balance on these debts is approximately $82,645. Applicant hopes to negotiate 
a settlement in the future. However, a promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to 
establish a good-faith effort to resolve one’s delinquent debts.  
 
Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  
  
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. 
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s 
employment situation in 2003. I considered the favorable comments from his current 
supervisor. I considered that he accepted his current job for less pay and had several 
periods of unemployment. I also considered that Applicant has no plan in place to 
resolve his two largest accounts, but has given approximately $60,000 to needy 
alcoholics during the period in which he could have worked on resolving his delinquent 
accounts. While he has resolved several debts alleged in the SOR and several debts 
that are not alleged in the SOR, he has made little effort to resolve his two largest 
accounts. Mindful of my responsibility to rule in favor of national security in cases where 
there is doubt, I find Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.

Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
