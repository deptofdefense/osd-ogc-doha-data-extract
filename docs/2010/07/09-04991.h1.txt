LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence
shows Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties. Applicant and his
spouse overextended themselves in the real estate market. As a result, Applicant and
his spouse sought protection from their creditors under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in
which a discharge was granted in November 2009. Given the recency of the bankruptcy
case and the surrounding circumstances, it is too soon to tell if Applicant’s financial
problems were purely situational, and it is too soon to determine if Applicant is now
conducting his affairs in a financially responsible manner. Applicant did not provide full,
frank, and candid answers to questions about his financial record during the security
clearance process. Accordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is
decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   
 Exhibit 1. 2

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on September 22,1
2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a
complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines
known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct.
The SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to
decide whether to deny or revoke Applicant’s security clearance.  
Applicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me January 25, 2010. The hearing took place April 7, 2010. The
hearing transcript (Tr.) was received April 14, 2010. 
Findings of Fact
Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance for his current employment as a senior network engineer.
His educational background includes an associate’s degree. He is married and has a
four-year-old son.
 Applicant has worked in the information technology (IT) field since at least
2000.  He worked as a network services manager for a software company from May2
2000 to June 2005. He then worked as network services manger for a beverage
distributor from June 2005 to June 2008, when he and his wife relocated to their current
state of residence as part of a long-term plan to be closer to family and join a particular
church. Applicant began employment as a head network engineer for a communications
company at an annual salary of about $90,000, about $30,000 less than his previous
job. He was unexpectedly laid off about five months later in October 2008. From
November 2008 until he began his current job in March 2009, he worked two contractor

jobs and had periods of unemployment for a total of six to eight weeks.   His annual3
salary is now about $75,000.   
Applicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleged nine debts in
some form of delinquency (for example, in collection, charged-off, past-due, or in
foreclosure). The nine debts consisted of four medical accounts in collection, one
charged-off credit card account, and four real estate accounts. The vast majority of the
debt consists of the credit card and real estate accounts. 
While living in their previous state of residence, Applicant and his spouse bought
an expensive home (more than $500,000) and also made a real estate investment
(undeveloped land) in another state. They had enjoyed some success in the real estate
market in the past. But due to the then declining and slowing real estate market,
Applicant and his spouse decided to rent their former home when they relocated in June
2008. By October 2008, they were forced to take action to evict their tenants for failure
to pay rent.  This event took place about the same time Applicant was laid off from his4
employment. As a result, Applicant began falling behind on some of his financial
obligations in late 2008 or early 2009. They sought the advice of a bankruptcy attorney
in 2009, and they were advised to stop making payments in anticipation of filing for
bankruptcy.
From about November 2008 to March 2009, Applicant depleted his available
savings.  He began his current job in March 2009, and he completed a security5
clearance application at the end of that month.  In response to Question 26, a multi-part6
question about his financial record, Applicant answered in the negative to all questions.
At hearing, Applicant explained that his spouse was responsible for bill paying and the
family finances, and he asked her if they were late on any payments when he
completed the application and was told that one account was 60 days late (the
mortgage loan on the rental property).  Accordingly, he answered all questions7
(including a question about defaulting on any type of loan) in the negative because 60
days was not within the scope of the question. But an April 2009 credit report shows a
mortgage loan was already in foreclosure and had been 180 days past-due with a past-
due balance of $37,288.  Applicant was unable to explain those circumstances.  In8 9
addition, the same April 2009 credit report shows foreclosure proceedings were initiated

against a mortgage loan with a balance of $188,900 for the investment property
(undeveloped land) purchased by Applicant and his spouse.  10
Applicant and his spouse filed their Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in August
2009, and a discharge was granted in November 2009.  In the bankruptcy paperwork,11
Applicant and his spouse listed a gross income of $135,737 for 2007, $80,784 for 2008,
and $28,579 for 2009 year-to-date.  They also listed a foreclosure lawsuit resulting in a12
judgment; the case number, 2008-CA-######, indicates the lawsuit was filed in
calendar year 2008.  In addition, they listed two properties (the rental property and the13
investment property) that had been through foreclosure within one year before the start
of the Chapter 7 case.  14
The Chapter 7 petition’s summary of schedules shows $348,629 in assets and
$397,481 in liabilities.  The assets included real property (their current home) valued at15
$296,400. The liabilities included $295,481 for creditors holding secured claims (the
mortgage loan on Applicant’s current home) and $102,000 for creditors holding
unsecured nonpriority claims (unsecured debt listed on Schedule F). Many of the debts
in the SOR were discharged in the bankruptcy case, and they are summarized in the
table below.

account was 30 days past-due on three occasions.18
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As19
noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,20
any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified
information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.

6
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An21
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  22
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting23
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An24
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate25
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme26
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.27
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.28
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it29
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant30
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline31
F is that: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  32
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry. Indeed, the practice of evaluating a person
based on their record of financial responsibility (or lack thereof) is used in various
industries. For example, the insurance industry uses credit-based insurance scores
when determining insurance rates because the scores have been found to be effective
in predicting future losses.  
The record evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial33
obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish34
these two disqualifying conditions. In reaching this conclusion, the three medical debts
for $52, $33, and $39—taken individually or together, or combined with the other
debts—are so minor that they are of little, if any, security significance. These debts are
resolved for Applicant because they fall within the maxim de minimis.  35
 AG ¶ 20 (a) – (f). 36

Under Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:36
(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts;
(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
Of those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here is subparagraph (b). But
the credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security concerns. Applicant and
his spouse incurred substantial indebtedness when they overextended themselves in
the real estate market. Debt equals risk, and Applicant increased his risk when he
moved to another state and changed jobs (at a lower salary) while still obligated on a
large amount of mortgage loan debt. A nonpaying tenant made the situation worse. A
job loss and a period of underemployment put Applicant in an untenable position. The
Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was inevitable. Although the Chapter 7 discharge order
eliminated Applicant’s legal obligation to pay a debt that was discharged, it does not
constitute a good-faith effort to resolve debts under subparagraph (d). Applicant now
has the benefit of the fresh start provided by bankruptcy law. But given the recency of
the bankruptcy case and the surrounding circumstances, it is too soon to tell if
Applicant’s financial problems were purely situational. And it is too soon to determine if
Applicant is now conducting his affairs in a financially-responsible manner to avoid
similar problems or difficulties in the future. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against
Applicant.

Turning to personal conduct under Guideline E,  it includes issues of false37
statements and credible adverse information that may not be enough to support action
under any other guideline. The overall concern is:  
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide
truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any
other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  38
A statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An
omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely
forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely
thought the information did not need to be reported. 
The issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant’s answers to questions about his
financial record when he completed a security clearance application. The record
supports a conclusion that Applicant did not give full, frank, and candid answers about
his financial record when he completed his March 2009 security clearance application.
As shown by the April 2009 credit report, two foreclosure actions had already been
initiated and both mortgage loans were past-due. Moreover, Applicant’s Chapter 7
bankruptcy petition, a document signed under penalty of perjury, shows a foreclosure
lawsuit was filed in 2008, and it shows two properties were subject to foreclosure within
the previous year. Given these circumstances, Applicant had to know the mortgage
loans were in default, and he had to know about the foreclosures, when he completed
his security clearance application in March 2009. His explanations to the contrary are
not credible.  
The established falsifications support application of two disqualifying conditions
that address the deliberate falsification of relevant facts during the security clearance
process.  I reviewed all the potential mitigating conditions under the guideline and39
conclude none apply. Making false or misleading statements to the federal government
during the security clearance process is serious misconduct. It is not easily explained
away, excused, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. 
To conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant’s history of
financial problems and his false statements, when taken  together, justify current doubts
about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-
consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1) – (9).40
10
reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and40
Applicant’s favorable evidence. Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided
against Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.c: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.d–1.i: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
