GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding foreign preference.  
Eligibility for a security clearance or access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 23, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86).1 On June 4, 2009, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories.2 He responded to 
the interrogatories on June 19, 2009.3 On November 30, 2009, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
1 Item 4 (SF 86), dated October 23, 2008. 
 
2 Item 5 (Interrogatories with attached Personal Subject Interview, dated February 13, 2009), dated June 4, 
2009.

Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information (December 29, 2005) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline C (Foreign Preference), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 15, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated December 28, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to 
Applicant on March 10, 2010, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 
days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on April 6, 2010, but as of June 
24, 2010, had not submitted any information or documents. The case was assigned to 
me on July 8, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a.(1) 
through 1.a.(4), and 1.b., of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
an audio/video technician in the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany),4 and he is 
seeking to obtain a security clearance.  
 
Foreign Preference 
 
Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Germany.5 His father, a 
native-born U.S. citizen serving with the U.S. Army at the time, married his mother, a 
native-born German citizen.6 They had Applicant (born in Germany in 1983), his brother 
(born in Germany in 1985), and his sister (born in the United States in 1987).7 
Applicant’s father retired from the U.S. Army in 2001, and decided to remain in 
Germany as an employee of a defense contractor.8 Applicant was raised in Germany,

and at least since he was 10 years old, he has resided there.9 The record is silent as to 
the location of his early schooling, but from September 2001 until June 2004, he 
attended a vocational, technical, or trade school in Germany, where he served an 
apprenticeship.10 He was conscripted into the German Army, and served on active duty 
in logistics as a supply clerk from July 2005 until April 2006.11 Commencing in 
November 2006, Applicant worked for companies in the German private sector.12 In 
November 2007, he joined his current employer.13 He has never married.14  
Applicant’s mother registered his birth with the U.S. State Department in 
February 1984, and received an FS Form 240, Consular Report of Birth.15 She also 
obtained a German passport for him when he was an infant.16 He renewed his German 
passport in June 2006, and it is due to expire in June 2011.17 Applicant apparently 
obtained another German passport in June 2008, and it is due to expire in June 2018.18 
He received his U.S. Passport in September 2001.19 His “personalausweis,” or German 
Identity Card, also referred to as the European Digital Passport, using the same number 
as that reflected on his passport, was issued in September 2006, and is due to expire in 
August 2011.20 The personalausweis is sufficient to travel among European Union 
countries, and is somewhat similar to the U.S. Passport Card, which has limited use 
between the United States and Canada or Mexico.  
In September 2008, Applicant, accompanied by his German girlfriend, traveled to 
the United States.21 Because this was the first time she had ever traveled outside of

positions. Id. at 13.

Germany, and did not wish to process through U.S. immigration alone, Applicant used 
his German travel documents rather than his U.S. passport, when he entered the United 
States.22 He also used it upon returning to Germany.23 The SOR alleges that Applicant 
used his “reisepass” in lieu of his U.S. passport,24 and Applicant admitted doing so. A 
German reisepass is actually the German passport, not another separate document. 
Applicant’s German passport (the one issued in June 2008) was destroyed by his FSO 
on May 19, 2009.25 The record is silent regarding the status of the German passport 
issued in June 2006. 
Applicant exercised his right to vote as a German citizen in German elections in 
every election since being eligible to do so, including the election in about 2002 or 2003, 
and intends to continue voting in German elections so long as he resides in Germany.26 
He does so because he pays German taxes and wants to influence the German parties 
to spend his tax money in a manner most beneficial to him.27 He has never voted in a 
U.S. election.28 
As of February 2009, Applicant and his German girlfriend intended to move into 
an apartment together in Germany in May 2009.29 He purchased the apartment and has 
a mortgage with a German bank.30 He also has checking and savings accounts with the 
German bank.31 
In February 2009, Applicant stated a willingness to renounce his German 
citizenship, but had not done so.32 He claimed his “loyalty lies with the U.S.” and that he 
is free from any conflicting allegiances or potential coercion.33

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”34 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”35   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”36 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.37  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

and modified.    
 
36 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”38 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”39 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline C, Foreign Preference 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in 
AG ¶ 9:       
When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a 
foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of 
the United States. 
The foreign preference guideline notes several conditions that could raise 
security concerns. Under AG ¶ 10(a), “exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of 
foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a 
family member” is potentially disqualifying. This includes but is not limited to: AG ¶ 
10(a)(1), “possession of a current foreign passport;” AG ¶ 10(a)(2), “military service or a 
willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;” AG ¶ 10(a)(4), “residence in a foreign 
country to meet citizenship requirements;” and AG ¶ 10(a)(7), “voting in a foreign 
election.” AG ¶¶ 10(a)(1), 10(a)(2), and 10(a)(7) have been established. 
The Government argued the applicability of AG ¶ 10(a)(4), but there is no 
evidence to support that argument. Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and 
Germany because his German native-born mother, married to his U.S. native-born 
38 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
39 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
7 
                                      
 
father, a member of the U.S. Army stationed in Germany, gave birth to him in Germany. 
He resided in Germany because that was where his parents resided, and there is no 
evidence that, as a dual citizen of the United States and Germany, he had to continue 
residing in Germany to “meet citizenship requirements.” AG ¶ 10(a)(4) does not apply. 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from foreign preference.  AG ¶ 11(a) applies if “dual citizenship is 
based solely on parents’ citizenship or birth in a foreign country.” Under AG ¶ 11(b), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the individual has expressed a 
willingness to renounce dual citizenship.”  Also, AG ¶ 11(e) may apply if “the passport 
has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise 
invalidated.” As noted above, Applicant’s dual citizenship occurred because of the 
location of his birth in Germany to parents who were citizens of the United States (his 
father) and Germany (his mother). AG ¶ 11(a) applies. While Applicant has expressed a 
willingness, in February 2009, to renounce his German citizenship, to date, there is no 
evidence that he has done so. I recognize that the actual act of renunciation is not 
required under the AG. Nevertheless, under the facts and circumstances of this case, I 
conclude that AG ¶ 11(b) only partially applies.  
The issue regarding Applicant’s personalausweis and reisepass is much more 
complex.  One German passport was issued in June 2006, and it is due to expire in 
June 2011. The record is silent regarding the status of that particular German passport. 
Another German passport was issued in June 2008, and it was due to expire in June 
2018, but was destroyed by his FSO on May 19, 2009. His personalausweis was issued 
in September 2006, and is due to expire in August 2011.   
Dual citizenship, alone, is not automatically a security concern. However, when a 
dual citizen obtains a foreign passport and chooses to use his or her foreign passport in 
lieu of his or her U.S. passport, the security concern appears. In this instance, because 
of the multiple German passports, and the uncertain status of all but one of his German 
documents, AG ¶ 11(e) only partially applies. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
8 
                                      
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s foreign preference. 
Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Germany because of the citizenship 
of his German native-born mother and his U.S. native-born father, a member of the U.S. 
Army stationed in Germany, and his birth in Germany. Aside from an unspecified 
relatively brief period in the U.S., Applicant has resided in Germany with his family 
because that was where they reside. He has expressed a willingness to renounce his 
German citizenship and had a German passport destroyed. He is currently employed by 
a U.S. federal contractor. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the circumstances of his birth and the acquisition of German citizenship were 
circumstances beyond his control, Applicant continued to exercise the rights, privileges, 
and obligations of German citizenship. He obtained and used German passports and 
identity documents in lieu of U.S. documents, even when entering the U.S. He served 
on active duty with the German military. He voted in German elections. The record is 
silent regarding voting in U.S. elections. He was educated in German schools and 
employed by German companies. He owns a German apartment. In essence, Applicant 
is a German who, solely by virtue of his father’s citizenship, happens also to be a U.S. 
citizen. (See AG & 2(a)(1), AG & 2(a)(2), AG & 2(a)(3), AG & 2(a)(4), AG & 2(a)(5), AG 
& 2(a)(6), AG & 2(a)(7), and AG & 2(a)(9).) 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his foreign 
preference.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline C:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.(1):   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.a.(2):   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.a.(3):   Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
