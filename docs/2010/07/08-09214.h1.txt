Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has a lengthy history of binge alcohol consumption. Since 2003, 
Applicant has been involved in several alcohol-related incidents with law enforcement or 
the courts. He received outpatient alcohol-related treatment and attended some 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. In 2004, a clinical psychologist diagnosed him as 
alcohol dependent. He continues to consume alcohol. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 12, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF-86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On August 5, 
2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended 
and modified; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on 
December 29, 2005.

included for privacy reasons.

The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA then 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
On August 26, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 4) 
Applicant did not request a hearing. Department Counsel requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. On January 8, 2010, Department Counsel announced she was 
ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On January 19, 2010, DOHA assigned 
Applicant’s case to me. On February 16, 2010, the case was scheduled for a hearing on 
March 2, 2010. (HE 2) The hearing was terminated because Applicant requested a 
delay to consult with counsel and review documents. (Hearing transcript (Tr.) from first 
hearing) On May 6, 2010, Department Counsel and Applicant agreed that the hearing 
could be held on June 3, 2010. (Tr. 17-18) On May 14, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing 
notice setting the hearing for June 3, 2010. (Tr. 17; HE 2) Applicant’s hearing was held 
on June 3, 2010. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits (GE 1-9) (Tr. 
21-22), and Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 12, 23-24; AE A-B) Applicant did not 
object to the admissibility of GE 1-9. (Tr. 21-22) Department Counsel did not object to 
my consideration of AE A-B. (Tr. 23-24) I admitted GE 1-9 (Tr. 21-22) and AE A-B. (Tr. 
23-24) Additionally, I marked two hearing notices, the SOR, and the response to the 
SOR as HE 1-4. On June 21, 2010, I received the transcript. I held the record open until 
June 21, 2010. (Tr. 117-118, 140) No post-hearing exhibits were received.  (HE 5) 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.b to 1.f, and 1.h to 1.n. (HE 4) He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g. (HE 
4) His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of 
fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a Government contractor (Tr. 76; GE 1).3 
His current employer has employed him for more than six years. (Tr. 77) He served in 
the Air Force from July 1995 to April 2004. (Tr. 78; GE 1) He reached the grade of E-5; 
however, at the time of his discharge, he was an E-2. (Tr. 78) He married in December 
1997, and divorced in June 2002. (GE 7 at 1) He remarried his former spouse (FS) in 
February 2004, and they were divorced in 2008. He has two children. He completed 
various computer and automation-related courses. (Tr. 76) Applicant has not attended 
college. (GE 1) Applicant has held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive 
compartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 77, 99) He currently holds an interim secret 
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3Applicant’s SF-86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise.

clearance. (Tr. 77) He was never investigated or disciplined for compromising classified 
information. (Tr. 100)  
 
Alcohol consumption and rehabilitation treatment 
 
Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess to the point of intoxication and 
had alcohol-related blackouts from approximately 1992, when he was age 16, to at least 
December 2008. (Tr. 73-74; SOR ¶ 1.a; GE 2 at 2) He received an alcohol evaluation in 
about March 2002; however, the March 2002 evaluation did not result in a diagnosis of 
alcohol abuse or dependence. (SOR ¶ 1.b; HE 4) Applicant was in the Air Force from 
ages 18 to 27. (Tr. 98) During those nine years, he said he had five alcohol-related 
incidents.4 (Tr. 98)  
 
Applicant’s April 13, 2003 driving while intoxicated offense 
 
On April 12 and 13, 2003, while Applicant was in standby status, he consumed 
alcohol. (Tr. 94; GE 9 at 9) He went to bed at 3:00 am on April 13, 2003. (Tr. 94) Three 
hours after going to bed, he was driving to see FS, and he hit a parked tractor trailer. 
(Tr. 94; GE 7 at 1; GE 9 at 1, 4) No one was injured in the accident. (GE 7 at 1) He was 
arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (SOR ¶ 1.c; HE 
4) His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .223. (Tr. 94; GE 9 at 1) He was found guilty 
and sentenced to pay a $350 fine. (GE 7 at 2) His driver’s license was suspended for 
three months. (SOR ¶ 1.c; GE 1 at 3; GE 7 at 2; GE 9 at 9; HE 4) He completed an 
eight-hour class concerning alcohol consumption. (GE 7 at 2) In his response to a letter 
of reprimand for the DUI, he stated, “I have nothing but regret for what I have done.  .  .  
. this is an isolated incident and this will NEVER happen again.  .  .  . I want to reiterate 
that nothing like this will ever happen again.” (emphasis in original) (GE 9 at 4)  
 
On September 23, 2003, Applicant made a written statement to a Defense 
Security Service special agent. (GE 7) Applicant said he had an alcohol-consumption 
evaluation which determined he “did not have an alcohol problem.” (GE 7 at 2) He 
stated, his “arrest for DUI in Apr 03 was an isolated incident. I would normally drink 
socially, and very sporadically, drinking about two beers or two drinks, maybe every few 
weeks.” (GE 7 at 2) He commented that since his “arrest in Apr 03, I no longer drink 
alcohol at all. I do not drink and drive.” (GE 7 at 3) 
 
Applicant’s commander determined he was derelict in the performance of his 
duties by becoming intoxicated while in standby status. (SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 9 at 4; HE 4) 
On May 14, 2003, his command imposed nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 
15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for this offense. (SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 9 at 7-9; 
HE 4) His punishment included a suspended reduction in grade and forfeiture of $200 
 
4The SOR in ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j lists four alcohol-related incidents during those nine years. 
The SOR does not include the allegation that he assaulted FS in January 2004. (GE 4 at 6) FS recanted 
her allegation of assault in January 2004 and no adverse action was taken against Applicant. (GE 4 at 6) I 
consider the alleged January 2004 assault to be unsubstantiated. No adverse inference is made against 
Applicant for the alleged January 2004 assault of FS.    
 
4 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
pay two months; however, he completed the suspension period without vacation of the 
suspended reduction in grade. (Tr. 100-101; GE 9 at 9) 
 
On April 14, 2003, Applicant received an alcohol evaluation. He was diagnosed 
as having “Alcohol Intoxication.” (SOR ¶ 1.e; GE 4 at 30, 34; HE 4) The evaluation 
noted he had two factors weighing towards alcohol dependence: “increased tolerance” 
and “social/occupational impairment as indicated by DUI.” (GE 4 at 34) The evaluator 
recommended “Basic Education” as a corrective remedy. (GE 4 at 35) 
 
Applicant’s other alcohol-related offenses and evaluations 
 
In October 2003, Applicant received NJP under Article 15, UCMJ, for assault. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f; HE 4) He consumed approximately four beers and part of a pitcher of beer 
before participating in an altercation with FS. (SOR ¶ 1.f; GE 4 at 24; HE 4) See the 
statement of W, infra, for extenuating information concerning altercations between 
Applicant and FS.  
 
From November 2003 to January 2004, Applicant received outpatient alcohol 
treatment for a diagnosed condition of “Alcohol Abuse.” (SOR ¶ 1.g; GE 4 at 11-21, 28) 
The November 4, 2003 medical report listed two established criteria for alcohol abuse: 
“recurrent substance-related legal problems” and “continued use despite recurrent 
problems caused or exacerbated by the use.” (GE 4 at 28) It also listed one factor 
relating to alcohol dependence, “increased tolerance.” (GE 4 at 28) He described three 
hangovers, one blackout, passing out once, being drunk three times, “buzzed” fifteen 
times, and binge drinking on twelve occasions in the last 12 months. (GE 4 at 26)  
 
In February 2004, while on an Air Force base, Applicant went outside to urinate. 
(GE 3 at 5) The security police saw him, pursued him, and apprehended him. (GE 3 at 
5) The security police alleged that he resisted apprehension. (GE 3 at 5) On February 
26, 2004, medical personnel interviewed Applicant about his alcohol consumption. He 
said that prior to the February 2004 incident where he allegedly resisted arrest, he 
consumed nine alcohol drinks. (GE 4 at 6) He received a diagnosis of “Alcohol 
Dependence.” (SOR ¶ 1.i; HE 4) The February 26, 2004 medical report listed four 
established criteria for alcohol dependence: “increased tolerance;” “using more than 
intended;” “social/occupational impairment;” and “continued use despite persistent or 
recurrent .  .  . psychological (e.g. depression/anxiety) consequences.” (GE 4 at 10) The 
February 26, 2004 medical report said the diagnosis “does have a negative impact on 
the patient’s trustworthiness and reliability to properly safeguard classified information.” 
(GE 4 at 10-11) This medical report was signed by an alcohol and drug abuse counselor 
and a clinical psychologist. (GE 4 at 11) In March 2004, Applicant received NJP under 
Article 15, UCMJ, for communicating a threat, disorderly conduct, and resisting 
apprehension. (SOR ¶ 1.h; HE 4) He received a letter of reprimand and a reduction in 
grade. (SOR ¶ 1.h; HE 4) 
 
In April 2004, Applicant was found sleeping on the ground near a fence. (SOR ¶ 
1.j; HE 4) He was charged with being drunk and disorderly. (SOR ¶ 1.j; HE 4) In April 
2004, he received alcohol-related outpatient counseling, and he was again diagnosed 
 
5 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
as “Alcohol Dependent.” (SOR ¶ 1.k; HE 4) Applicant’s commander wanted him to stay 
in the Air Force, and offered him the option of remaining in the service or accepting a 
general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 102) Applicant asked to be 
discharged from the Air Force. (Tr. 102) In April 2004, he was discharged from the Air 
Force for a pattern of misconduct. (SOR ¶ 1.l; HE 4) He was barred from the local 
military installation, and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. 
(SOR ¶ 1.l; HE 4) He explained that he did not complete the alcohol-counseling 
program recommended by medical personnel because he was discharged from the Air 
Force. (SOR ¶ 1.g; Tr. 75; GE 4) When he left active service, he believed he could 
control his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 97) From June 2004 to May 2006, Applicant said 
he consumed “little to no[]” alcohol. (Tr. 96) 
 
On May 6, 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol before becoming involved in an 
altercation with FS. The police arrested him and charged him with domestic assault 
(third degree). (SOR ¶ 1.m; GE 5 at 4, 12-13; GE 6 at 3; HE 4) He pleaded guilty to 
criminal attempt (third degree) because he wanted to protect FS’s military career. (GE 5 
at 8) He thought her command would take adverse action against her for her 
“revengeful behavior against me” if she abandoned her allegation of assault (GE 5 at 8). 
He was sentenced to six months of probation and ordered to attend AA meetings once 
a week for six months. (GE 5 at 10; GE 5 at 7) The court ordered him to abstain from 
alcohol consumption and to pay court costs, fees, and fines. (GE 5 at 6-10) On March 
14, 2007, he completed all requirements ordered by the court. (GE 4 at 8; GE 5 at 10) 
On March 21, 2007, the probation office released him from probation. (GE 5 at 9) He 
stopped consuming alcohol from May 2006 until August 2008. (Tr. 96) 
 
In March 2009, Applicant felt stress because of problems he had with FS. (Tr. 
103) He consumed about ten drinks of alcohol, and then drove a vehicle. (Tr. 83) The 
police arrested Applicant for DUI.5 (Tr. 83) His blood alcohol content (BAC) was a little 
above .15. (Tr. 93) In July 2009, he pleaded guilty to DUI, and the court ordered him to 
attend ten AA meetings. (Tr. 84-85) He promised himself that he would not consume 
alcohol again. (Tr. 114) The court also ordered nine months of probation and 
suspended his driver’s license for 90 days. (Tr. 84-86) The court ordered him not to 
drink alcohol while he was on probation, and he complied with this requirement. (Tr. 86-
87) He passed eight urinalysis tests, which checked for alcohol consumption. (Tr. 87) 
He did not report the March 2009 DUI to his security officer. (Tr. 86) 
 
Applicant said, “I occasionally only drink to excess,” and he denied that he was 
an alcoholic because he did not have physical cravings for alcohol. (Tr. 88, 112) He was 
not physically dependent on alcohol. (Tr. 112-113) When he went to AA meetings, he 
did not acknowledge that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 89) Applicant’s most recent attendance 
at an AA meeting was four months ago. (Tr. 81, 87) He consumed alcohol about once a 
 
5Applicant objected to having to disclose the March 2009 DUI because it was not part of the 
discovery materials provided to him. (Tr. 82-83) I overruled his objection; however, I held the record open 
after his hearing to allow him to obtain and present additional mitigating information relating to his DUI 
and 2009 alcohol-related counseling. (Tr. 81) The SOR was not amended, and the March 2009 DUI will 
not be used to establish a disqualifying condition. (Tr. 82-83) It is relevant to the whole-person concept. 
See n. 7, infra.

week, and his alcohol consumption is on the weekends. (Tr. 98) Two weeks before his 
hearing, he drank five drinks containing alcohol. (Tr. 78)  
 
After his March 2009 DUI, a medical professional (MP) evaluated his alcohol 
consumption during his 14 weeks of counseling or treatment. (Tr. 89, 104-105) 
However, MP did not provide a copy of the evaluation to Applicant. (Tr. 89, 117-118) 
Applicant did not believe MP’s evaluation concluded he was alcohol dependent, and he 
did not believe he was alcohol dependent. (Tr. 90, 97, 104) MP’s evaluation did say that 
Applicant had a “compulsion to drink too much on occasion.” (Tr. 105) MP told Applicant 
that Applicant did not really need the alcohol-awareness course or alcohol counseling. 
(Tr. 105) However MP did not have access to Applicant’s history of alcohol-related 
incidents, and Applicant did not advise MP that there was a previous diagnosis of 
alcohol dependence. (Tr. 90)     
 
Applicant continues to consume alcohol notwithstanding his 2004 diagnosis of 
“Alcohol Dependence.” (Tr. 78, 113-114; SOR ¶ 1.n; HE 4) Applicant preferred to be a 
social drinker and to drink alcohol responsibly. (Tr. 115) He was not convinced that 
abstaining from alcohol completely was a “healthy” situation for him. (Tr. 115) Typically, 
Applicant drinks alcohol to excess when there is stress in his life. (Tr. 104) He did not 
disclose information about the SOR allegations to his employer because he was 
ashamed of his alcohol-related history. (Tr. 109)   
 
W’s statement  
 
W has known Applicant and FS since June 25, 2004. (Tr. 25-26) She is a 
periohygenist. (Tr. 42) FS has periodically called the police and made false allegations 
against Applicant as a method of dominating and controlling him. (Tr. 29-41) In May 
2006, FS, after consuming some alcohol, started an argument with Applicant. (Tr. 28) 
FS pushed Applicant, and he pushed her back. (Tr. 28) FS called the police, and the 
police arrested Applicant. (Tr. 29) Applicant decided to plead guilty because he wanted 
to protect FS from getting into trouble about making false statements to the police. (Tr. 
30) 
 
In August 2008, FS committed an unprovoked assault upon Applicant and W. (Tr. 
32, 36) W’s back and neck were damaged when FS grabbed W by the hair and pulled 
her head back and forth. (Tr. 36) W was further injured when FS jumped on top of W, 
causing W to fall to the ground and resulting is a severe cut to W’s back. (Tr. 36) W was 
taken by ambulance to a hospital. (Tr. 37) The county district attorney’s office provided 
documentation permitting Applicant and W to register as victims. (Tr. 33-34) On 
November 19, 2008, W asked the district attorney to dismiss the charges against FS in 
order “to cover up what [FS] did.” (Tr. 34-35, 41) W and Applicant wanted the charges 
against FS to be dismissed because Applicant’s two children needed their mother’s 
support. (Tr. 44) FS received diversion or probation for a year. (Tr. 45) Problems 
between FS and W have continued with FS and W obtaining restraining orders and the 
police questioning W. For example in April 2009, FS called the police and alleged W 
had kidnapped her daughter, when W was actually babysitting for FS’s daughter. (Tr. 
46)

On March 2, 2010, FS was present and prepared to make a statement on 
Applicant’s behalf at his hearing. (Tr. 53, 55) However, FS and Applicant have a new 
dispute. (Tr. 53) FS and FS’s new boyfriend wanted to take Applicant’s children to a 
different state; however, Applicant opposed the move. (Tr. 53) On June 3, 2010, FS was 
not present at his hearing.    
        
W stated that from June 25, 2004, to May 2006, Applicant drank a couple of 
drinks on an infrequent basis. (Tr. 37) He stopped drinking alcohol from May to August 
2008. (Tr. 38) W lives with Applicant. (Tr. 39) W observed Applicant drinking alcohol a 
couple of weeks ago. (Tr. 47-48) W encouraged Applicant to go out and have a couple 
beers with his friends. (Tr. 116) W consumed alcohol with Applicant and did not see a 
problem with Applicant’s continued alcohol consumption. (Tr. 48) He drinks about four 
drinks containing alcohol, and her limit in an evening is three to four beers. (Tr. 49-50)    
 
Character evidence 
 
A coworker, who has had a security clearance for 27 years, has worked with 
Applicant for six years. (Tr. 55, 60) He has never noticed an odor of alcohol on 
Applicant’s person, or any other alcohol-related problems. (Tr. 56, 62) He has never 
observed Applicant consuming alcohol. (Tr. 60-61) He was not aware of the allegations 
in the SOR or whether Applicant attended any AA meetings. (Tr. 60-61, 64) He did not 
know of any incidents involving Applicant’s compromise of classified documents or 
national security. (Tr. 57) Applicant is a good worker with an excellent reputation as a 
worker and employee. (Tr. 57, 68) He supports reinstatement of Applicant’s security 
clearance. (Tr. 55-64) If Applicant loses his clearance, he will lose his job, and 
Applicant’s children will lose their medical and dental benefits. (Tr. 64)    
  
Applicant’s program manager (PM) has worked with Applicant since 2004. (AE A) 
PM has “never encountered a situation to question [Applicant’s] integrity or 
professionalism,” and he strives to fulfill his duties. (AE A) Applicant’s work performance 
is exceptional, and he recommends reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. (AE 
A) PM was not aware of Applicant’s history of alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 107-109) 
 
Applicant’s operations manager (OM) describes Applicant’s technical knowledge 
as outstanding. (AE B) Disapproval of Applicant’s security clearance will “result in 
degraded overall service to the customer.” (AE B) OM is not aware of the alcohol-
related allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 108-109) 
   
Applicant contended that he should retain his security clearance because he 
wanted to continue to contribute to the national defense. (Tr. 106) He loves his country 
and wishes to continue to support the United States. (Tr. 107) 
   
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
 
8 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication that Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
   
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with respect to the allegations set 
forth in the SOR. 
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶ 22 provides:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
10 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
AG ¶¶ 22(e) to 22(g) do not apply. A licensed clinical social worker did not 
diagnose Applicant as alcohol dependent. The scope and quality of the “alcohol 
rehabilitation program” was unclear. Applicant has not failed to comply with a court 
order not to consume alcohol. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(a) to 22(d) apply. In April 2003 Applicant had a DUI, while he was on 
standby status. In November 2003, he disclosed that he had engaged in binge alcohol 
drinking on about twelve occasions in the previous year. In February 2004, he was 
drunk and disorderly and involved in an altercation with the Air Force special police. In 
April 2004, he was found passed out from excessive alcohol consumption. In February 
2004, a psychologist diagnosed him with “Alcohol Dependence” and listed four 
established criteria for alcohol dependence: “increased tolerance;” “using more than 
intended;” “social/occupational impairment;” and “continued use despite persistent or 
recurrent .  .  . psychological (e.g. depression/anxiety) consequences.”6 In October 
2003, and May 2006, after consuming alcohol, he engaged in physical altercations with 
FS. Applicant’s lengthy history of binge alcohol consumption and multiple alcohol-
related incidents since 2003 establish these four disqualifying conditions.      
 
 
6The well-respected psychiatric reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000, 
has defined “alcohol dependence” to be a psychiatric condition that meets the following diagnostic 
criteria:  
  
A maladaptive pattern of alcohol use, leading to clinically significant impairment or 
distress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the 
same 12-month period:  
 
(1) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: (a) a need for markedly increased 
amounts of the alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or (b) markedly 
diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the alcohol.  
 
(2) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: (a) the characteristic withdrawal 
syndrome from the alcohol; or (b) the same (or a closely related) alcohol is taken to 
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.  
 
(3) The alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was 
intended.  
 
(4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.  
 
(5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the alcohol (e.g., visiting 
multiple doctors or driving long distances), use the alcohol, or recover from its effects.  
 
(6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced 
because of alcohol use.  
 
(7) The alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent 
physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by 
the alcohol (e.g., continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by 
alcohol consumption).

  “Once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance eligibility, 
there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 
F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the Government has met its initial burden 
concerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant 
to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. Four Alcohol 
Consumption mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 23 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g are mitigated. The alcohol evaluation Applicant 
received in March 2002 was favorable and not a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or 
dependence. The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e all directly relate to his April 
2003 DUI. The three allegations are merged in the allegation into SOR ¶ 1.c. SOR ¶ 1.g 
does not constitute disqualifying conduct because he ended his alcohol-related 
counseling when he was discharged from the Air Force. 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant began consuming alcohol 
at age 16. After his first DUI in April 2003, he told his command in his response to his 
letter of reprimand that he had stopped his alcohol consumption and such an incident 
would not recur. Applicant was involved in additional alcohol-related incidents and his 
command reduced him from E-5 to E-2. He was discharged from the Air Force after 
nine years of service. Although he was able to stop consuming alcohol for substantial 
periods of time, he subsequently resumed his alcohol consumption. From April 2003 to 
May 2006, he had four established alcohol-related incidents. He attended alcohol 
awareness classes, received alcohol counseling, and attended weekly AA meetings for 
 
12 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
six months in 2004 and for ten weeks, ending four months before his hearing. However, 
he is not currently attending AA meetings or receiving any other ongoing alcohol-related 
counseling or treatment. He does not fully acknowledge his alcohol-consumption 
problems. He denies he is an alcoholic and believes he can consume alcohol 
responsibly despite strong evidence of a compulsion to continue drinking alcohol and 
the 2004 diagnosis of alcohol dependence. He has not received a positive prognosis 
from a medical professional. He has not made satisfactory progress in his alcohol 
rehabilitation program. He consumed alcohol as recently as two weeks before his 
hearing. In sum, the possibility of relapse continues to cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Alcohol consumption concerns are not 
fully mitigated for the reasons stated under this guideline and in the whole-person 
concept, infra. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although there is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance, 
the mitigation evidence is insufficient to resolve security concerns at this time. Applicant 
had a very stressful relationship with FS, and he used alcohol to relieve stress. He 
attended some alcohol-awareness classes, and he received some alcohol-related 
counseling. He attended six months of weekly AA meetings in 2004 and ten weeks of 
AA meetings up to four months before his hearing. He is not on probation and his 
driver’s license is not suspended. He contributes to his company and the Department of 
Defense. There is no evidence of any disciplinary problems unrelated to his off-duty 
alcohol-consumption at his current employment. There is no evidence of any drug 
abuse, financial problems, disloyalty, or intentional violations of national security. His 
character and good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to 
 
13 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
retain his employment after his security clearance was called into question. He provided 
written supportive statements from his project manager and operations manager as well 
as one coworker who made a statement at his hearing. He is an exemplary worker and 
employee. Applicant knows the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, and 
he has made some efforts in the past to abstain from alcohol consumption. More 
recently, he has attempted to drink alcohol responsibly.   
 
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial at 
this time. Applicant has had a problem with alcohol use beginning when he was 16 
years old. He has consumed alcohol at times to excess, with some periods of 
abstinence, for about 17 years. In April 2003, more than three hours after he stopped 
drinking alcohol, Applicant’s blood alcohol content was .223 after the vehicle he was 
driving struck a parked tractor trailer. In February 2004 and April 2004, he was involved 
in alcohol-related incidents involving the police. In February 2004, an Air Force 
psychologist diagnosed him with being alcohol dependent, and he was discharged from 
the Air Force in April 2004 after nine years of service. In May 2006, he was involved in 
an alcohol-related altercation with FS that resulted in his conviction for criminal attempt. 
In March 2009, Applicant had his second DUI. His March 2009 DUI is considered for the 
limited issue of whether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation under the whole-
person concept.7 Even if there were no DUI in 2009, I would not support reinstatement 
of his security clearance. His medical treatment notes, admissions, and discharge 
summaries describe his history of alcohol consumption and establishment of his alcohol 
dependency.8 I am not convinced he fully recognizes the importance of overcoming his 
alcohol problems and establishing a significant pattern of abstinence.9 
 
7In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)).  
 
8See Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) and commentary explaining why statements made to 
obtain medical treatment are deemed reliable. 
 
9For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “that Applicant continued to drink 
even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge’s application of MC 3.”  In ISCR Case No. 
05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a 
clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most 
recent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to 
intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued alcohol consumption was 
not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 
04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three 
years before hearing, and reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
 
14 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial 
alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence that full mitigation of security concerns is not 
possible unless there was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol 
consumption.10 Applicant continues to consume alcohol. His limited rehabilitative efforts 
and lack of fundamental changes in behavior are important manifestations that increase 
security concerns. The likelihood of recurrence of alcohol consumption is still sufficiently 
probable to require more time with continued abstinence. Lingering doubts remain 
concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Abstinence from 
alcohol consumption for a significant period of time is needed to provide sufficient 
assurance that he will not return to alcohol consumption. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 12968, the Directive, the Regulation, the AGs, and other 
cited references to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. For 
the reasons stated, Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the Government’s case, 
and he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d to 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.h to 1.n:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
