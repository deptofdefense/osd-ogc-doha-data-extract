HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
July 2000. His statement of reasons (SOR) listed 30 debts totaling $19,445. Four debts 
were duplications, and four debts were not established, leaving 22 unresolved SOR 
delinquent debts totaling $18,572. He did not provide proof of any payments on any of 
his SOR debts. He has insufficient income to pay his current expenses. Financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 1, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
January 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On January 30, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
(HE 3 at 8) On February 28, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On March 12, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to 
me. On March 19, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On April 7, 2010, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered ten exhibits 
(GE 1-10) (Tr. 21), and Applicant offered six exhibits. (Tr. 23-25; AE A-F) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-10 and AE A-F. (Tr. 21-22, 25) Additionally, I admitted 
the hearing notice, SOR, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and a chart showing the 
status of Applicant’s SOR debts as hearing exhibits. (Tr. 22; HE 1-4) On April 15, 2010, 
I received the transcript.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admits responsibility for 15 debts owed to the 
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.c to 1.e, 1.k to 1.s, and 1.v to 1.x, totaling $15,550. (HE 3) He

Department Counsel stated that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i was duplicated by the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.y; the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j was duplicated by the debt in SOR ¶ 1.p; the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.f was duplicated by the debt in SOR ¶ 1.aa; and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g was 
duplicated by the debt in SOR ¶ 1.ac. There was insufficient evidence to substantiate 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.ab. (Tr. 17) I granted Department Counsel’s motion to withdraw the 
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.y, 1.aa, 1.ab, and 1.ac. (Tr. 16-17, 74) I marked withdrawn 
on the SOR and placed my initialed next to the allegations in subparagraphs 1.j, 1.y, 
1.aa, 1.ab, and 1.ac. (Tr. 17, 74)  
 
Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
July 2000. (Tr. 67-68; HE 3) He did not carefully monitor his credit after the bankruptcy. 
(Tr. 67-68)   
 
In addition to the 15 debts Applicant admitted in his SOR response, at his 
hearing he said he contacted the creditors and based on what he learned, he also 
admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. (Tr. 68, 70, 72)  
 
2Applicant said his former wife opened the account in SOR ¶ 1.c without his knowledge; however, 
he admitted the debt was in his name. (Tr. 70-71) He said he would try to prove it was not his debt in the 
future. (Tr. 71) 
 
3Applicant said his former wife opened the account in SOR ¶ 1.k without his knowledge; however, 
he admitted the debt was in his name and that he was living in the home when the cable services were 
received. (Tr. 75) She received the bills and kept them him. (Tr. 76-77) 
  
4Applicant said he gave the money for this bill to his wife; however, she did not pay the bill. (Tr. 
82) The creditor called Applicant on his telephone and told him his account was delinquent. (Tr. 83)  
 
5Citations to the credit reports supporting the debts are listed in the table at HE 4.

Applicant wrote a letter to the hospital-creditor about several medical SOR debts, 
and learned he was responsible for them. (Tr. 69-72) He provided five medical bills 
dated January 25, 2010. Four show an account balance of $50, after insurance co-
payment, for medical debts accrued on December 26, 2005, February 7, 2006, June 23, 
2006, and November 10, 2007. (AE E) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f is for $50. He provided a 
bill dated January 25, 2010, showing an account balance of $240, with no insurance co-
payment, for a medical debt accrued on November 15, 2006. (AE E) The debt in SOR ¶ 
1.g is for $240. 
 
Applicant denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, 1.z, and 1.ad. (Tr. 
86-87, 91-93) He contacted the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.t and 1.z. (Tr. 87, 91) The creditor 
in SOR ¶ 1.t was unable to locate information about Applicant’s debt. (Tr. 87) He said 
he tried to call the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.z, and that creditor did not have information about 
his responsibility for this debt. (Tr. 92) The collection company in SOR ¶ 1.u ($2,178) is 
seeking payment on behalf of a credit card company. (Tr. 87) Applicant had a credit 
card from that particular credit card company, and he was uncertain if he had paid his 
debt. (Tr. 87-89) He denied that he had an account with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.ad. (Tr. 
92) He did not want to accept responsibility for debts until he had proof of his 
responsibility. He did not provide any documentation from the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 
1.u, or 1.z. (Tr. 87, 89, 91-92)  
 
When Applicant completed his security clearance application on June 1, 2009, he 
disclosed his bankruptcy in 2000, the 2003 medical debt for $3,479 in SOR ¶ 1.l, and 
the $1,100 telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.n. (GE 1) 
  
Applicant said his spouse wrote bad checks on his checking account, which 
generated the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.v ($61), 1.w ($68), and 1.x ($59). (Tr. 89) She was 
responsible for paying their debts, using his checking account. (Tr. 90) Applicant also 
wrote checks on their account. (Tr. 90) He has not paid the creditors for these three bad 
checks. 
 
Applicant was unemployed from May 2002 to October 2003, from August 2004 to 
September 2005, and from December 2005 to September 2006. (Tr. 44-47) He lived 
with his girlfriend and then spouse from 2003 to 2008. (Tr. 45-47, 77-78) He was the 
homemaker, and she was the wage earner. (Tr. 45) He has been steadily employed 
since September 2006. (Tr. 45-47) He currently earns $21 per hour. (Tr. 49) 
 
Applicant’s fiancée is 30 years old, and she has known him for 16 years. (Tr. 28, 
31-32) They were high school sweethearts, broke up, and then Applicant married 
someone else. (Tr. 32) They stayed in touch over the years. (Tr. 32) They intend to 
marry in September 2010. (Tr. 36) She is employed in a sensitive position as a 
contractor at a federal agency. (Tr. 28, 30) She has held sensitive government-related 
employment for nine years. (Tr. 31) She has paid $920 of Applicant’s $1,200 rent for 
several months. (Tr. 39-40) He often repays what he borrows. (Tr. 40) Applicant has 
learned from his mistakes and wants to have good credit. (Tr. 29) She described him as 
trustworthy and responsible. (Tr. 28) Despite his financial problems, she recommended 
approval of his security clearance. (Tr. 28)

Applicant’s monthly gross salary is $3,800; his net monthly salary is $2,400; his 
monthly expenses are $3,100;6 and his net remainder is negative $700. (Tr. 54; GE 2 at 
4) He has not had financial counseling. (Tr. 47) He did not pay any of his SOR debts. 
(Tr. 47) He is current on his child support, rent, and utilities. (Tr. 59, 61) His monthly 
child support is $768; however, he must pay $888 monthly until the new earnings 
withholding becomes effective. (Tr. 51; AE A, B) His car is paid off. (Tr. 59, 63) He 
borrowed $600 from his fiancée the previous month to pay his rent. (Tr. 62) In 2009 and 
in early 2010, he paid the attorney handling his divorce more than $1,000. (AE F) 
However, he still owes the attorney who handled his divorce $497. (Tr. 59; AE F) He 
has $700 in his checking account and $20 in his savings account. (Tr. 60) He owes 
about $2,000 on his federal income taxes. (Tr. 80-81) An additional non-SOR state tax 
lien was filed against him on November 17, 2009, in the amount of $1,808. (Tr. 80, 94; 
GE 10) He thought the 2004 state tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.m for $1,041 and the 2009 state 
tax lien might be related to the same debt. (Tr. 99) He did not have the funds to address 
his SOR debts. (Tr. 93) He was focused on paying his lawyer and his living expenses 
for himself and his children. (Tr. 93) 
 
Applicant blamed his former spouse for his financial predicament. (Tr. 51-52) She 
abused his trust. (Tr. 98) He was not aware of some of her financial decisions. (Tr. 52) 
Applicant said he was naïve, young, and silly. (Tr. 78-79, 96, 98) He did not pay 
attention to his finances. (Tr. 79) Applicant was considering a debt consolidation plan.

contact companies, and identify duplications. (Tr. 35) He said he accepted responsibility 
for his financial plight. (Tr. 96) He admitted he made mistakes and wanted to avoid the 
mistakes he has made in the past. (Tr. 96, 97) He wanted to be a model citizen and 
father. (Tr. 96) Although Applicant did not make any payments on any of his SOR debts 
(Tr. 97), he promised to pay his debts when he is able to do so. (Tr. 102)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
In July 2000, Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. His SOR lists 30 delinquent debts totaling $19,445.8 Some of his 
debts have been delinquent more than five years. He has an unpaid state tax lien from 
2004. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
   
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent 
SOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.  
 
8The four debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.y, 1.aa, and 1.ac are duplications and are not adverse financial 
information in this case.

AG ¶ 20(b) has limited applicability. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged 
by insufficient income, separation, divorce, unemployment, and his spouse’s financial 
irresponsibility. However, his financial circumstances have been stable since December 
2008 when he was separated from his spouse. Applicant was aware of several 
delinquent debts when he completed his security clearance application on June 1, 2009. 
Moreover, there is insufficient evidence about these circumstances to show that he 
acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is insufficient documentary evidence 
he maintained contact with his creditors,9 attempted to pay or settle any of his SOR, or 
attempted to establish payment plans with his creditors. His documented actions were 
insufficient to establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. He received financial counseling in 2000 as part 
of his bankruptcy. Applicant did not provide a plan to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
personal financial statement or budget indicated he had a negative monthly cash flow of 
$700. Applicant cannot receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, 
established payment plans (by making payments), adequately documented disputes of 
debts, or otherwise resolved 22 of his SOR debts. He has not resolved small debts such 
as the bad checks written on his checking account, which generated the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.v ($61), 1.w ($68), and 1.x ($59). There are some initial, positive “indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has admitted responsibility for and 
promised to pay 21 SOR debts, showing some good faith mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).10 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable because Applicant did not provide documentation showing 
he disputed any of his SOR debts. Applicant consistently denied responsibility for the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.t ($75), 1.u ($2,178), 1.z ($50), and 1.ad ($125). He is credited with 
mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.z, and 1.ad because those debts are small and 
creditors are not likely to make much effort to determine Applicant’s responsibility for 
these small debts.  
 
9“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
Applicant does not receive credit for mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.u ($2,178) 
because he did not provide documentation showing any attempts to resolve or dispute 
this debt. His efforts are insufficient in light of the size of this debt. Additionally, he 
admitted the possibility the debt was valid. He was uncertain whether he had resolved 
his account with the original credit card holder that sent the debt to the collection 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.u.     
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment for the last 
18 months. He did not provide proof of any payments to his SOR creditors. He has not 
provided documentation showing sufficient progress on his SOR debts. His documented 
steps are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant is 33 years old. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit 
for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor. There 
is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. There is no 
evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His unemployment, separation, 
divorce, and problems with his spouse’s handling of their finances contributed to his 
financial woes. Several character witnesses laud his diligence, professionalism, and 
responsibility. I give Applicant substantial credit for admitting responsibility for 21 SOR 
debts totaling $16,394. He is also credited with disclosing his financial problems on his 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
security clearance application. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, 
and mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His unsecured delinquent 
debts were discharged in 2000 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His post-
bankruptcy delinquent debts date back to a 2003 medical debt for more than $3,000 
and a 2004 state tax lien for more than $1,000. He was separated from his spouse in 
December 2008 and since then had stable employment. He did not provide proof of any 
payments of his SOR debts even though five of them were less than $100. His personal 
financial statement showed he had a monthly negative cash flow of $700. His fiancée 
has kept him from sinking further into debt. The issue of financial considerations was 
further emphasized when he received the SOR, yet he did not make any payments to 
his creditors. He had ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient 
opportunity to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He did not pay, 
start payments, document and justify any disputes, or otherwise resolve any SOR 
debts. He has not reduced his expenses sufficiently to make progress resolving his 
SOR debts. Because of his negative cash flow, it is likely that he will accrue additional 
delinquent debts. His promises to pay some of the SOR debts are insufficient to mitigate 
these debts because there is insufficient evidence to explain why he has not done more 
to address his SOR debts after becoming aware that they raised a security concern.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not fully mitigated, and he is not eligible for access to classified 
information.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
