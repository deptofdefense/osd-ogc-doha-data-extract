Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence
shows Applicant has a history of financial problems, which are ongoing. In addition, he
has a 2009 conviction for second-degree assault for which he is serving probation. His
financial problems, his criminal conviction, and his status as a probationer, when taken
together, justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.
Accordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on February 4,1
2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a
complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines
known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline J for criminal conduct.
The SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to
decide whether to deny or revoke Applicant’s security clearance.  
Applicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me March 19, 2010. The hearing took place April 30, 2010. The
hearing transcript (Tr.) was received May 10, 2010.
The record was kept open until May 28, 2010, to allow Applicant an opportunity
to submit additional documentary information about his finances. He made a timely
submission of 28 pages in total, which includes a cover letter. The matters are admitted,
without objections, as Exhibit H (which includes Attachments A–F). 
Findings of Fact
Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began his current
employment as a briefing officer in August 2007, and he is in good standing with his
employer.  He is married and has two children from the marriage, a 23-year-old son and2
a 17-year-old daughter. In addition, he has an adult daughter from a previous
relationship.
Applicant’s employment history includes more than 20 years of honorable military
service in the Army.  He served on active duty during 1983–1986. He then continued his3
service as a part-time soldier in the Army National Guard until 1988, when he began
full-time duties. He served until he retired in June 2007, as a senior noncommissioned

officer (pay grade E-7). His discharge paperwork (the DD Form 214) reflects military
education consistent with his grade, and it reflects multiple decorations and medals, to
include the Meritorious Service Medal (2  award), the Army Commendation Medal (3nd rd
award), the Army Achievement Medal (4  award), and the Army Good Conduct Medalth
(5  award).  th 4
Applicant’s current annual salary is about $81,000.  For 2009 his salary was5
$79,000; it was $75,000 in 2008; and it was $75,000 in 2007, when he began his
current job. In addition, Applicant receives about $1,500 monthly ($18,000 annually)
between a combination of retired pay and Veteran’s disability compensation.  6
Applicant completed a security clearance application in January 2007.  In7
response to two questions about financial delinquencies, Applicant reported ten
delinquent accounts. Also, in response to a question about civil court actions, Applicant
reported four judgments taken against him, two by a homeowners’ association, one by a
bank, and one by a utility company. He reported that all four judgments were paid.  
Applicant has a history of financial problems. For example, the credit reports in
this case reflect multiple public records related to Applicant’s financial problems. A June
2008 credit report lists five judgments and two liens; a November 2008 credit report lists
15 judgments, several of which were satisfied, and four state tax liens; an August 2009
credit report lists four judgments and two liens; and a March 2010 credit report lists
three judgments and two liens.  None of the liens are alleged in the SOR. 8
Applicant points to his problematic marriage as the primary cause of his financial
problems.  His wife was a big spender while not making any meaningful contribution to9
their household income for the last several years. She worked full-time until about 2002,
when she quit to start her own business, which eventually failed, as a personal trainer.10
In addition, she pursued an expensive hobby or sport known as fitness or figure
competitions. Applicant separated from his wife in April 2009, and they reconciled briefly
until separating again in August 2009. Applicant remains separated from his wife and a
divorce has not yet begun. His minor daughter lives with his wife. A state court ordered
Applicant to pay $1,000 monthly in support beginning in August 2009, and the order

expired or ended in April 2010.  To date, he has not been ordered to make child-11
support payments for the benefit of his minor daughter.12
Another factor that contributed to Applicant’s financial problems was the
unexpected expenses he incurred in 2008–2009, due to the state criminal case for
which he is now serving probation. In May 2008, he was arrested for second-degree
assault stemming from his involvement in a mutual affray in his neighborhood.13
Applicant was not the instigator, and it appears he was coming to the aid of his wife and
daughter when he became involved in the mutual affray that resulted in someone
breaking his finger. In response, Applicant tore off the individual’s ear. In February
2009, Applicant pleaded guilty, via an Alford plea,  and was sentenced to one year in14
jail, suspended, and probation for 18 months.  In addition, he was ordered to pay15
restitution directly to the victim as well as complete 240 hours of community work
service within six months. His probation is scheduled to end in about August 2010. 
The SOR alleged 14 debts in some form of delinquency. The debts consist of
three unpaid judgments, four medical accounts in collection, six accounts in a collection
or charged-off status, and a mortgage loan in foreclosure. Applicant addressed the
debts in his hearing testimony  and they are summarized in the table below.  16

To sum up, Applicant paid, settled, or resolved ten accounts, two judgments are unpaid
but he is making payments, the modification of the mortgage loan is pending final
approval, and one judgment is considered unresolved due to lack of documentation.

have a savings account.  He has a 401(k) account with a balance of about $5,800.  He17 18

Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As22
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt23
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An24
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  25
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting26
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An27
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate28
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme29
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it32
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant33
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline34
F is that: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  35

 AG ¶ 19(c). 37
 AG ¶ 20 (a) – (f). 38

Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry. Indeed, the practice of evaluating a person
based on their record of financial responsibility (or lack thereof) is used in various
industries. For example, the insurance industry uses credit-based insurance scores
when determining insurance rates because the scores have been found to be effective
in predicting future losses.  
The record evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial36
obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish37
these two disqualifying conditions.
Under Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:38
(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts;
(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.

Of those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d).
Each is discussed below.
Applicant’s financial problems resulted from a combination of circumstances
largely beyond his control. His problematic marriage due to a spendthrift spouse was a
circumstance largely beyond his control that had a negative effect on his financial
stability. He is now separated and might be headed toward divorce. Also, the May 2008
criminal case was unexpected and out-of-character for Applicant. Beyond the criminal
consequences, the incident compelled Applicant to spend money for attorney’s fees and
other expenses (i.e., restitution), money that could have been used to repay debt. 
In addition, Applicant is making a good-faith effort to repay his overdue debts or
otherwise resolve the debts. As revealed by the table above, Applicant paid, settled, or
resolved ten accounts, two judgments are unpaid but he is making payments, the
modification of the mortgage loan is pending final approval, and one judgment is
considered unresolved due to lack of documentation.  
Turning next to criminal conduct under Guideline J,  the suitability of an39
applicant may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a criminal history
record regardless of whether the criminal conduct at issue has been subject to
prosecution and adjudication in a court of law. The overall concern under Guideline J is
that:
Criminal activity creates doubts about a person’s judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  40
The arrest, charge, and conviction for second-degree assault stemming from
Applicant’s involvement in the May 2008 mutual affray raise a security concern.  In41
addition, his status as a probationer raises a concern as well.  But criminal conduct42
happened under unusual circumstances, which suggests that similar criminal conduct is
unlikely to recur.  Indeed, in closing argument, Department Counsel accurately43
characterized Applicant’s criminal conduct as a “one-off incident in [his] record, that he
does not have any other criminal conduct on his record that we would be concerned
about.”  44
 Exhibits 9 and 10. 45
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1) – (9).46
10
Standing alone, Applicant’s criminal conduct does not pose undue security
concerns. But Applicant’s financial problems, his criminal conviction, and his status as a
probationer, when taken together, justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability,
and trustworthiness. Although Applicant has made progress in addressing his financial
problems, it is too soon to tell if his financial problems were purely situational. Notably,
some of his financial problems have existed for a long time (i.e., the homeowners’
association obtained the two judgments in 2002 and 2004).  Likewise, having $29,91245
past-due on a mortgage loan with a balance of $225,000 indicates that the loan was in
default for some time. 
It is also too soon to tell if Applicant is now conducting his affairs in a responsible
manner to avoid similar problems in the future. In this regard, the modification of his
mortgage loan, which was in foreclosure, is still pending final approval. His marriage is
also in a state of flux or instability, which may result in further financial obligations for
Applicant (i.e., spousal support or child support or both). In sum, the evidence shows
Applicant has a large amount of turmoil in his life. His situation is a reminder of the
commonsense understanding that individuals in the middle of great emotions or turmoil
are not safe risks.
To conclude, following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these
doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence, which46
was not insubstantial. Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against
Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f–1.h: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b–1.e, 1.i–1.n: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant
11
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
