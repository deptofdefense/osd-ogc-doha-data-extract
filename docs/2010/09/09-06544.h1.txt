HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
March 2001. Her statement of reasons (SOR) listed 17 debts totaling $40,260. She 
resolved all of her SOR debts, except one debt, which is in a payment plan. She failed 
to disclose any delinquent debts and her May 25, 2008 arrest on her security clearance 
application. Financial considerations are mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns 
are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 15, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
July 28, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On August 13, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
(HE 3) On August 24, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on 
Applicant’s case. On August 27, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On 
August 27, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On September 3, 2010, 
Applicant’s hearing was held.1 At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits 
(GE 1-6) (Tr. 15-16), and Applicant offered 91 pages (pg.) of documents. (Tr. 17-18; pg. 
1-91) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 and pg. 1-91. (Tr. 16, 19) 
Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR 
as hearing exhibits. (HE 1-3) After the hearing, Applicant provided 33 pages of 
additional documentation. (pg. 1A-33A) There were no objections to Applicant’s post-
hearing exhibits. On September 8, 2010, I received the transcript.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed 17 debts totaling $40,260. The status of her 17 SOR 
debts is as follows:3  
 
1.a (medical collection debt—$7,832)—PAID. Applicant paid $3,179 on August 6, 
2010, resolving this debt. (Tr. 53-55; pg. 2, 5, 9, 10, 2A, 26A) A September 7, 2010 
letter from the creditor states the debt has been settled in full. (pg. 27A)  
 
1.b (medical collection debt—$423)—PAID. Applicant paid $423 on September 
9, 2010, resolving this debt. (pg. 2, 11) The creditor wrote the debt was paid. (pg. 11)   
 
1.c (medical collection debt—$75)—DISPUTED. Applicant was unable to locate 
the source of this debt, and it was not on her most recent credit report.  (pg. 2, 14) 
 
1.d (collection account—$5,065)—PAID. The creditor wrote on August 6, 2010, 
that Applicant could settle the debt by paying $2,500 by August 20, 2010. (pg. 16) 
Applicant paid $2,500 on August 10, 2010, resolving this debt. (pg. 2, 4, 15, 16)  
 
1.e (collection account—$2,724)—PAID. Applicant paid $1,800 on August 6, 
2010, resolving this debt. (pg. 2, 4, 17, 18) An August 10, 2010 letter from the creditor 
indicates the debt was settled in full on August 9, 2010. (pg. 18) 
 
1.f (collection account—$701)—PAID. Applicant paid $356 on August 6, 2010, 
resolving this debt. (pg. 2, 4, 19, 20, 21, 2A, 29A) On September 3, 2010, the creditor 
wrote the debt was settled. (pg. 29A) 
 
1.g (collection debt—$1,273)—PAID. Applicant paid $1,056 on August 6, 2010, 
resolving this debt. (pg. 2, 4, 22-25, 2A, 31A) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.l, and 1.o are 
duplications of each other. Letters from the creditors and collection agents document 
the account transfers. (pg. 22-25, 37, 41) A September 1, 2010 letter from the creditor 
indicates the debt is resolved. (pg. 31A) 
 
1.h and 1.i (collection debts—$442 & $425)—DISPUTED. Applicant said the two 
accounts were not her accounts (pg. 26, 28) She wrote the credit reporting company 
contesting the entries for the two delinquent accounts, and on August 10, 2010, the 
credit reporting company responded that the debts were under investigation. (pg. 27, 
29) On August 31, 2010, the credit reporting company deleted the derogatory entries 
from Applicant’s credit report.

1.j (collection debt—$1,438)—PAID. Applicant wrote that she paid $896 on May 
11, 2010, resolving this debt. (pg. 2, 30-34, 2A) Applicant did not provide proof of the 
debit from her checking account or a statement from the creditor indicating the debt was 
paid.  
 
1.k (collection debt—$6,724)—PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant paid $100 on August 
27, 2010, initiating her payment plan. (pg. 2, 6, 35-36, 42) The settlement agreement 
requires her to increase her monthly payments to $250 in February 2011. (pg. 36) The 
settlement agreement lists three creditors who were involved in this account. (pg. 36) 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.p are duplicates of each other.     
 
1.l (collection account—$2,298)—PAID. Duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. 
See status of SOR ¶ 1.g, supra. 
  
1.m (collection account—$1,654)—DISPUTED. This debt was not on Applicant’s 
most recent credit report.   
 
1.n (collection account—$297)—PAID. An August 31, 2010 letter from the

2A, 33A)   
 
1.o (collection debt—$2,198)—PAID. Duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. See 
status of SOR ¶ 1.g, supra. 
 
1.p (collection debt—$6,309)—PAYMENT PLAN. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 
1.p are duplicates of each other. See status of SOR ¶ 1.k, supra. 
 
1.q (collection debt—$331)—DISPUTED. This debt was not listed on Applicant’s 
most recent credit report.  
 
In 2009, Applicant hired two credit management companies to resolve her credit 
issues. (Tr. 29-30; pg. 57-70, 77-78) She believed a credit management company was 
supposed to pay each creditor an amount each month. (Tr. 70) Applicant listed her 10 
creditors and debts totaling $24,227 for the credit management company. (pg. 59) Of 
the ten debts, three are medical debts, and the three medical debts total $10,513. (pg. 
59) She provided checking account statements showing payments of $385.99 on 
January 26, 2009; February 25, 2009; March 25, 2009; May 29, 2009; and December 
26, 2009. (pg. 71, 72, 74, 75, 76) She provided a checking account statement showing 
a payment of $315 on April 16, 2009; however, the account number did not match the 
account number of the payments mentioned in the previous sentence. (pg. 73) She was 
unhappy with the results of the credit management companies; so she “fired” them. (Tr. 
29) She emphasized that she believed the credit management companies would make 
payments to all of her creditors. (Tr. 30-32, 70)

1,940. 
                                           
Applicant provided her November 30, 2009 personal financial statement (PFS) as 
part of her response to DOHA interrogatories. (GE 5)4 She stated her monthly net 
salary was $2,891. Her monthly expenses were $2,541, and her monthly debt payments 
total $2,290. She listed a positive net remainder of $250; however, the net remainder 
should be a negative $
 
Applicant paid $180 to resolve a 2009 medical collection debt that was not listed 
on her SOR. (pg. 45-48, 53-54) She paid $180 to resolve a 2009 medical collection debt 
that was not listed on her SOR. (pg. 45-48) She paid $190 to resolve a 2009 medical 
collection debt that was not listed on her SOR. (pg. 49-51) 
 
On May 6, 2010, Applicant paid a non-SOR collection company $652.60, as 
indicated on her monthly account statement. (pg. 79) This was the only debt paid by her 
credit management company. (Tr. 50) Applicant made three payments using automatic 
transfer of funds from her account for $407.05 on April 26, 2010; May 24, 2010; and on 
June 24, 2010. (pg. 80-83)  
 
On August 4, 2010, Applicant borrowed $10,000 from her 401K account to pay 
her delinquent debts. (Tr. 68; pg. 8) She has about $8,000 left in her 401K account. (Tr. 
79-80) In August 2010, she hired a law firm specializing in improving credit ratings and 
resolving delinquent debt. (Tr. 36; pg. 8)  
 
On August 31, 2010, a credit reporting company updated information on 12 of 
her accounts, and deleted derogatory information relating to five accounts. (pg. 4A-5A) 
This credit report lists a zero balance owed for all of Applicant’s accounts, except she 
has eight accounts with the following balances: $20,028 (pg. 8A, 13A); $2,217 (pg. 9A, 
14A); $36,064 (pg. 10A, 15A); $111,344 (pg. 11A); $411 (pg. 18A, 22A); $285 (pg. 19A, 
23A); $1,300 (pg. 19A, 23A); and $16,805 (pg. 19A, 23A) with a “PAID OR PAYING AS 
AGREED” for its status (pg. 6A-24A) In the last two years, she has not been late on any 
credit card, car payments, mortgage payments, or rent payments. (Tr. 40)  
 
Falsification of security clearance application 
 
On May 15, 2009, Applicant completed her SF-86. Section 22a asks, “Have you 
been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding 
against you; are you on trial or awaiting a trial on criminal charges; or are you currently 
awaiting sentencing for a criminal offense?” Section 22b asks, “Have you been arrested 
by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any other type of law enforcement officer?” 
Section 22c asks, “Have you EVER been charged with any felony offense?” Section 26 
asks in the last seven years, “have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?” 
and “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?”  
 
 
4 No negative inference concerning her eligibility for access to classified information is drawn from 
her PFS.

In 2007, Applicant co-signed a lease of an apartment to help a male friend (M), 
who was down on his luck.5 After several months, M failed to pay the rent and when she 
confronted M about the rent, he assaulted her. (OPM PSI at 1; GE 5) She went to court, 
and obtained an eviction order. Id. M’s female friend, C, obtained a no-contact court 
order against Applicant, and Applicant obtained a no-contact court order against C. Id. 
Sometime before May 25, 2008, C made a complaint to the police that Applicant was 
using a telephone to harass C. (Tr. 47) 
 
On May 25, 2008, Applicant called 911 to complain about her husband, and 
when the police officers arrived, they advised Applicant that there was a “wanted” or 
warrant for her arrest from another jurisdiction in the same state. (Tr. 45, 69; GE 5) The 
police put handcuffs on Applicant and took her into custody. (Tr. 44-45) The police 
released Applicant to her sister. (Tr. 45) Her sister took Applicant to the police station 
where the warrant was issued. (Tr. 46) The police fingerprinted Applicant and 
questioned her about C’s allegation of telephone harassment. (Tr. 46) Applicant denied 
C’s allegations. (Tr. 47) Applicant hired a lawyer to help with her criminal case. (OPM 
PSI at 2; GE 5) After Applicant appeared in court, the judge “dismissed [the harassment 
charge] on the condition that the restraining order not be violated for the remainder of 
the original year.” Id. Ultimately, the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 47, 69) 
 
Applicant answered, “No” to the questions in Section 22. Her answer is incorrect 
since a warrant was issued for her arrest, and she was actually arrested. On June 18, 
2009, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant about her failure to disclose her arrest 
on May 25, 2008. Applicant explained: 
 
When filling out the SF-86 she was confused regarding the meaning of 
arrested and convicted. She mistakenly thought the question was referring 
to a conviction. She now understands that arrested means being taken 
into custody. This was a misunderstanding on her part and not an attempt 
to conceal the arrest. (OPM PSI at 2)6 
 
At Applicant’s hearing on September 3, 2010, she provided a different 
explanation for why she failed to disclose her May 2008 arrest:  
 
I didn’t read the full question thoroughly. And I had assumed they were 
indicating, do you have a felony? That’s what I thought the question was 
asking me, was I convicted of any type of felony? Because if I had actually 
read it thoroughly, I would have said yes, I had been arrested, but I just - - 
it was just the way I perceived the question that was being asked [of] me.

OPM PSI accurately reflected the information that she provided to the OPM investigator. (GE 5)

Applicant answered, “No” to the questions in Section 26 about delinquent debt. 
(Tr. 48) She began to have financial problems when Applicant and her husband both 
became unemployed, and she decided a credit management company would be the 
best way to maintain currency on their mortgage and handle their creditors. (Tr. 65) She 
did not know her debts were delinquent. (Tr. 71) She lived with her husband and he 
sometimes got the mail. (Tr. 78) She believed that her accounts were being kept current 
or close to current by the credit management companies. (Tr. 48, 69-70) They said to 
send all correspondence from creditors to the credit management company. (Tr. 72) 
She paid the credit management companies approximately $4,000 and she thought 
they were making payments to all of her creditors. (Tr. 49, 69-70) She learned only one 
creditor was paid, and she was upset about being misled. (Tr. 49) She learned that her 
debts were not being paid after she completed her SF-86. She answered the questions 
to the best of her ability based on the financial information she had at the time she 
completed her SF-86. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant disclosed her bankruptcy in 2000 on her SF-
86. (GE 1) 
 
Character references 
 
On September 18, 2009, Applicant received a congratulatory email from a 
lieutenant colonel thanking her for her dedication and outstanding work ethic. (Tr. 42; 
pg. 87) He looks forward to working with her in the future. (pg. 87) Her supervisor 
echoed the lieutenant colonel’s laudatory comments. (pg. 88, 90) The lieutenant colonel 
also provided a letter lauding Applicant as “an invaluable asset to any organization that 
hires her” and praising her tireless efforts. (GE 5 at 89)    
 
On August 25, 2010, Applicant’s supervisor for more than one year wrote that 
she makes valuable contributions to the mission and is conscientious about security. 
(Tr. 41; pg. 85) She recommended entrusting Applicant with a security clearance. (pg. 
85) 
 
On August 26, 2010, Applicant’s colleague at her employment for six years 
described her valuable contributions to corporate goals. (pg. 86) She lauded Applicant’s 
diligence, attention to detail, trustworthiness, loyalty, and initiative. (pg. 86) She 
recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance. (pg. 86) 
      
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  
 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her OPM PSI, and her statement at her hearing.  
 
In March 2001, Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. Her SOR lists 17 delinquent debts totaling $40,260. Some of her 
debts have been delinquent for more than two years. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 
20(b), 20(c), and 20(d), as well as application of 20(e) to the debts she successfully 
disputed. Applicant received financial counseling in 2000 as part of her bankruptcy. She 
also generated a PFS as part of her response to DOHA interrogatories. Applicant’s 
financial situation was damaged by insufficient income during periods of unemployment, 
divorce, and her spouse’s financial irresponsibility. However, her financial 
circumstances have been stable from May 2009 until August 2, 2010 because she was 
employed by a government contractor. Applicant established that she acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. She attempted to use two credit management companies to 
maintain contact with her creditors.7 She attempted to pay or settle, or attempted to 
establish payment plans with her creditors. She paid seven debts, established a 
payment plan (by making her first payment) on one debt, adequately documented 
disputes of five debts, and showed that the other SOR debts were duplications. Her 
August 31, 2010, credit report does not list any delinquent debts or accounts. Her 
financial problem is being resolved or is under control. She admitted responsibility for 
and resolved her SOR debts, showing good faith mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).8  
 
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to the five SOR debts Applicant disputed: 1.c ($75); 1.h 
($442); 1.i ($425); 1.m ($1,654); and 1.q ($331). She disputed her responsibility for 
these five debts, and they were all removed from her credit report, which is the 
Government’s only basis for alleging the debts were delinquent. 
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on her debts because of marital problems and 
unemployment. She paid several thousand dollars to credit management companies 
that did not resolve her debts. She borrowed $10,000 from her 401K account and used 
those funds to pay all of her legitimate debts, except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($6,724), 
which is in an established payment plan. Her efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsification of her SF-86 on May 15, 2009, in 
this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative.9  
 
9The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
ring was:  
                                                                                                                                            
Applicant admitted that she failed to disclose debts that were currently delinquent 
more than 90 days, and debts that were delinquent more than 180 days in the last 
seven years on her May 15, 2009 SF-86. She also admitted that she failed to disclose 
her May 25, 2008 arrest for making harassing telephone calls on her May 15, 2009 SF-
86. Applicant contended that her inaccurate answers were not deliberate and intentional 
attempts to deceive the Government.  
 
When Applicant completed her SF-86, she disclosed her bankruptcy. She was 
not aware of any debts that were 180 days delinquent in the last seven years. She was 
not aware of any debts that were currently delinquent. She thought her credit 
management company was maintaining her debts in a current or almost current status. 
She would not have paid thousands of dollars to the credit management company if she 
had known that they were retaining almost all of her payments for fees and charges and 
not paying her debts. When she disclosed her bankruptcy, she alerted the Government 
to the possibility that she had financial problems. I find the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b is 
unsubstantiated because Applicant did not deliberately intend to provide false 
information to the government about her past due debts.   
 
 The allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a is problematic. Applicant knew what an arrest was. 
She has a masters degree. She was 46 years old. She had already been to court on her 
criminal charge of making harassing phone calls. She has sufficient knowledge and 
experience to know the difference between an arrest and a conviction, and between an 
arrest and a felony. On June 18, 2009, Applicant told the OPM investigator that “she 
was confused regarding the meaning of arrested and convicted. She mistakenly thought 
the question was referring to a conviction.” (OPM PSI) This explanation is not 
credible.10  Her explanation at her hea
 
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant’s level of 
education and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to 
disclose past-due debts on a security clearance application was deliberate).  
 
10The SOR did not allege that Applicant made a false statement to the OPM investigator in her 
PSI. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances 
in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (stating that inconsistent 
statements in exhibits may be considered in assessing an applicant’s credibility and evaluating mitigation 
and rehabilitation evidence even though they are not cited in the SOR as raising a security concern). I 
have considered Applicant’s non-SOR OPM PSI explanation for not disclosing her arrest for purposes of 
(a), (b), (c), and (e) and not for any other purpose. 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
I didn’t read the full question thoroughly. And I had assumed they were 
indicating, do you have a felony? That’s what I thought the question was 
asking me, was I convicted of any type of felony? Because if I had actually 
read it thoroughly, I would have said yes, I had been arrested, but I just - - 
it was just the way I perceived the question that was being asked [of] me. 
(Tr. 44) 
 
The only felony question (22c) is after the arrest question (22b). Moreover, her 
responses to many of the other questions on her SF-86 are thorough, providing a strong 
indication that she spent a considerable amount of time completing her SF-86 and did in 
fact read the question about arrests before she answered, “No.” In addition, her arrest 
had to be a fairly traumatic, shocking episode. The police took her into custody, 
handcuffed her and fingerprinted her on May 25, 2008. She had to call her sister for 
assistance on the day of her arrest. She hired a lawyer to help with her criminal case. 
After she appeared in court, the judge “dismissed [the harassment charge] on the 
condition that the restraining order not be violated for the remainder of the original year.” 
The arrest and disposition are sufficiently recent and exceptional in her life for me to 
conclude that she read Section 22 Police Record, recognized the requirement to 
disclose her arrest, and chose not to disclose the arrest information.    
 
AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) are established with respect to the allegation in SOR ¶ 
2.a, and further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.     
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this 
case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant’s falsification of her May 
15, 2009 security clearance application by intentionally failing to disclose her May 25, 
2008 arrest is recent, serious and not mitigated. A key component of the protection of 
classified information is reliance on security clearance holders to accurately report 
potential compromise of classified information. A person who has a recent arrest, and 
who denies having an arrest in the last seven years on their security clearance 
application cannot be relied upon to report potential compromise of classified 
information. Applicant’s conduct as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a is not mitigated at this time.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of her access to classified information. Applicant is 47 years old. She is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with her security responsibilities. She 
deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an 
 
15 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
employee of a contractor. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States 
and her employer. There is no evidence that she abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. 
Her and her former husband’s unemployment, their divorce, and problems with her 
spouse’s handling of their finances contributed to her financial woes. Several character 
witnesses laud her diligence, professionalism, and responsibility. I give Applicant 
substantial credit for admitting responsibility for 12 of her 17 SOR debts totaling 
$40,260, and then withdrawing money from her 401K account to resolve her delinquent 
SOR debts. She paid seven debts, established a payment plan for one debt, 
successfully disputed five debts, and the others are duplications. She is also credited 
with disclosing her bankruptcy on her security clearance application. These factors 
show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Applicant has a masters degree, and she was 46 years old 
when she signed her SF-86. She falsely stated she did not have any arrests in the last 
seven years, and she did not disclose her May 25, 2008 arrest for making harassing 
phone calls. On June 18, 2009, Applicant told the OPM investigator that “she was 
confused regarding the meaning of arrested and convicted. She mistakenly thought the 
question was referring to a conviction.” (OPM PSI) Her arrest was a traumatic, shocking 
episode, involving being handcuffed and fingerprinted. She hired a lawyer to help with 
her criminal case. After she appeared in court, the judge dismissed the harassment 
charge “on the condition that the restraining order not be violated for the remainder of 
the original year.” These events were sufficiently recent, traumatic, and complicated to 
have emphasized a careful review of the section of her security clearance labeled 
“Section 22: Police Record.” (emphasis in original) I conclude that she recognized the 
requirement to disclose her arrest, and deliberately chose not to disclose the arrest 
information. Her falsification of her May 15, 2009 security clearance application by 
intentionally failing to disclose her May 25, 2008 arrest is recent, serious, and not 
mitigated at this time. Additional time must elapse without conduct raising security 
concerns, before access to classified information is warranted.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are fully mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.r: For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.b:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
