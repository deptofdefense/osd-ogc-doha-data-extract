Decision 
______________ 
 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 16, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing version of a Security Clearance 
Application (e-QIP).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his financial 
situation. He responded to the interrogatories on February 14, 2010.2 On March 31, 
2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP), dated June 16, 2009.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated February 14, 2010). 
 
2 
                                      
 
                                                          
modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access 
to Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The 
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 12, 2010. In a sworn, written 
statement, notarized on April 26, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on May 13, 2010, and the case was assigned to 
another administrative judge on May 20, 2010. It was reassigned to me on June 23, 
2010, because Applicant had relocated to another geographical area. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on July 13, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
July 22, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits and 45 Applicant Exhibits were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant testified. The record remained open 
to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on August 5, 2010, he 
submitted 29 additional exhibits that were also admitted into evidence, without 
objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 29, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied both of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.a. and 1.b.) of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a mechanic/avionics technician,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He 
had previously been granted a security clearance while serving on active duty with the 
United States Army, or the Army National Guard, but lost it when he retired in 
December 2007.4 Applicant was on active duty from October 1983 until October 1986; 
remained in the inactive reserve until October 1989;5 joined the Army National Guard in 
February 1991, and was activated in March 2006.6 He was deployed to Iraq in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom from August 2006 until September 2007.7 Among his 
decorations and medals, Applicant was awarded the Army Achievement Medal, Army

Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service medal, Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, 
and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with “M” device.8 Applicant was employed by a 
number of employers in a variety of positions, including avionics technician, lead 
avionics technician, and lead technician.9 In November 1997, he received an 
associate’s degree in an unspecified discipline from an aviation technical college.10 He 
has been with his current employer since June 2009.11 
 
Applicant was married in October 1986, and divorced in June 1993.12 He married 
his second wife in June 1993.13 His current wife has three children. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1999. At some 
unspecified point prior to then, Applicant’s wife was ordered to pay child support to her 
first husband, her student loans had to be repaid, and their consumer debt became 
overwhelming. In 1999, Applicant and his wife, hoping to improve their financial 
situation, filed jointly for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.14 An 
unspecified amount of consumer debt was discharged.15  
 
The bankruptcy discharge did not permanently improve matters. Although they 
were both employed, in 2001, his wife’s pay was garnished to pay child support.16 
Financially, things did not improve the following year, for additional expenses were 
incurred when his stepson was hospitalized with a heart attack and had to undergo 
surgery, and Applicant’s mother lost her home to a fire.17 Over the next few years, his 
mother-in-law’s health issues and her needed automobile repairs, as well as the death 
of his nephew, resulted in additional expenditures.18 Applicant and his wife moved to 
different states in search of better paying jobs. Nevertheless, delinquent debt increased, 
and, according to a March 2010 credit report, several accounts had been charged off or

placed for collection.19 On January 25, 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial 
statement indicating monthly net income of $14,757,20 monthly expenses of 
$5,330.74,21 scheduled monthly debt payments of $3,658.35,22 and a net remainder of 
$5,767.91 available for discretionary spending.23 During the hearing, Applicant disputed 
the accuracy of his personal financial statement, claiming that he had additional 
accounts to pay.24 In June 2009, Applicant acknowledged having, at some point in the 
past seven years, including some at the present time, several delinquent accounts.25  
 
In August 2010, Applicant submitted two updated personal financial statements, 
one reflecting his stateside income, and the other reflecting overseas income (should he 
be granted his security clearance). Under the former, his monthly net income, including 
veteran’s disability, would be $6,115.45,26 monthly expenses, including scheduled 
monthly debt payments, would be $5,314.36,27 leaving a net remainder of $801.09 
available for discretionary spending.28 Under the proposed overseas income statement, 
his monthly net income, including veteran’s disability, would be $16,426.47,29 monthly 
expenses, including scheduled monthly debt payments, would be $5,361.90,30 leaving a 
net remainder of $11,064.57 available for discretionary spending.31 
 
Applicant stated: “Times were hard for everybody. . . . I just got busy with trying 
to get my career off the ground, and I lost track of the paperwork. . . .”32 As a result, 
Applicant did not timely file state or federal income tax returns during the tax years 1999 
through 2007.33 He was aware that regardless of whether or not he owes taxes, the law 
requires that he complete and file a return by April 15th.34 He did not file the required

returns because he saw they would owe money, and with so many other issues going 
on in their lives, they did not have the money to pay. Instead, they always hoped that 
the following year would be financially better for them.35 He was also afraid that if he 
filed a tax return without paying any money, he would be subject to tax liens or payroll 
deductions or garnishments.36 
 
For example, in 2008, Applicant failed to timely file his income tax return, and 
explained that “It didn’t occur to me to pay my taxes. . .  we were caught up with buying 
a home, and we were hoping that buying a home would give us a tax break, and that tax 
break would be put toward my tax debt.”37 Another explanation for another year was 
that he could not find a missing Form W-2.38 Still another explanation was that he was 
deployed to Iraq.39 An alternative explanation was that someone, not further identified, 
told him that deployed military members were tax exempt.40 Because “the Tax Code is 
so confusing,” Applicant relied on his employer to take the correct deductions from his 
salary to cover his taxes,41 and on his wife to figure out the taxes.42 He added, 
“mistakes were made.”43 Applicant never received any financial counseling or tax 
counseling for either his general finances or for regarding the filing of state or federal tax 
returns.44 
 
Applicant disagreed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding 
discrepancies between the IRS notices and his records pertaining to one particular tax 
year, thought to be 2006.45 Because of their confusion regarding the correct amounts 
owed, about three months before the DOHA hearing, Applicant engaged the services of 
a tax attorney to reconcile the IRS records with his records for that particular year.46

2000 through 2007.62 The agreement required an initial user fee of $105, plus a monthly 
installment payment of $1,208.24, beginning on September 24, 2010.63 Applicant’s first 
installment payment, including a convenience fee, of $1,236.49, was made on July 25, 
2010.64 There is no evidence to indicate he has filed the required state income tax 
returns. 
 
 Under Title 26, United States Code, Sec. 7203, Willful failure to file return, 
supply information, or pay tax: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or 
required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to 
make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully 
fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or 
regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty 
of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more 
than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not 
more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. . . . 
  
Applicant failed to comply with the filing requirements (“make a return . . . at the time or 
times required by law or regulations”) pertaining to tax years 1999 through 2007.65 
 
Performance Evaluations and Character References 
  
Applicant’s military performance was generally characterized as successful, but 
not excellent. In his most recent evaluation, his senior rater indicated Applicant’s overall 
performance was a “3,” the third highest of five possibilities, and recommended he be 
promoted with his peers.66 Supervisors, colleagues, and co-workers are very  
supportive and favorably characterize him using the following descriptive terms: great

64 Applicant Exhibit I-24 (Federal IRS Payment Confirmation, dated July 25, 2010). 
 
65 The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for the years 1999, 
2005, 2006, or 2007; that such failures were violations of Title 26, United States Code, Sec. 7203; that he had failed 
to timely file state or local income tax returns for the tax years 1999 through 2009; that he had his consumer debt 
discharged in bankruptcy in 1999; that he owed the IRS $64,729.57 in unpaid taxes, interest, or penalties; or that he 
recently had delinquent accounts. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed 
five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines 
is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

2003)). I have considered the non-SOR conduct for the five above purposes, and not for any other purpose.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”68 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”69   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”70 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

70 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.71  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”72 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”73 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
71 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying. A 
“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same” is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 19(g).  
 
As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
1999, when he and his wife filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 or the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. An unspecified amount of unsecured debt was discharged, and his financial 
problems were temporarily eliminated. But not for long, for accounts became delinquent 
and were sent for collection. Some were charged off. Over the ensuing years, extended-
family events occurred necessitating additional expenditures. Applicant did not timely 
file state or federal income tax returns during the tax years 1999 through 2007, and he 
failed to pay the necessary income taxes above those amounts withheld. He currently 
owes the IRS $64,729.57, including unpaid income taxes, interest, and penalties. The 
record is silent regarding his unpaid state income tax balance. Applicant has submitted 
some documentation to support his contentions regarding payments supposedly made 
to a variety of non-SOR accounts, as well as one payment to the IRS. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), 19(e), and 19(g) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@74  
 
74 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 1999, and were resolved by 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. But they eventually re-emerged. He 
attributed his continuing financial difficulties to extended-family member issues (health, 
automobile repairs, and residence burning), and some of those issues contributed to his 
debts. However, they were not the primary cause of his financial problems. He earned a 
fair salary, and should have been able to resolve his delinquent debts, but was unable 
to do so. Applicant did not timely file state or federal income tax returns during the tax 
years 1999 through 2007. Because the financial situation is frequent and continuing in 
nature, AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. Applicant’s handling of his federal income tax filings, 
under the circumstances, casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
 
He receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while some of the conditions 
that purportedly contributed to the financial problem at some point were beyond 
Applicant’s control (e.g., extended-family members’ health, automobile repairs, and his 
mother’s loss of her residence due to fire), Applicant failed to act responsibly under the 
circumstances. He failed to justify how those circumstances may have interfered with 
his timely filing of state and federal income tax returns for the tax years 1999 through 
2007. Although Applicant offered a variety of explanations, the most significant one is 
that he did not file the required returns because he anticipated he would owe money 
and did not have the money to pay. He was afraid that if he filed a tax return without 
paying any money, he would be subject to tax liens or payroll deductions or 
garnishments. The reasons stated do not establish he acted “responsibly under the 
circumstances.” 
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant denied ever having received 
financial counseling and debt consolidation guidance, although he should have received 
counseling from his bankruptcy and from his tax attorney in preparing a budget. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant finally initiated what might be 
considered a “good-faith” effort to repay the IRS, but only after the SOR was issued. 
Before he received the SOR, Applicant did not address his delinquent federal or state 
income tax filings or federal or state tax debts. He did not pay the necessary income 
taxes above those amounts withheld. There is evidence of April and May 2010 federal 
income tax filings, a more recent IRS-approved installment agreement, and one July 
2010, federal tax payment under it. There is no evidence indicating he has paid the 
various state income taxes as required by law.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
 
12 
                                      
 
                                                          
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant 
finally filed his federal income tax returns for the tax years 1999 through 2007, in 2010. 
His supervisors, colleagues, and co-workers are very supportive of his application and 
characterize him in very positive terms. He was deployed and served in a combat zone. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies, and a bankruptcy. He did not timely 
file state or federal income tax returns during the tax years 1999 through 2007, and 
failed to pay the necessary income taxes above those amounts withheld. He currently 
owes the IRS $64,729.57, including unpaid income taxes, interest, and penalties. The 
record is silent regarding his state income tax balance. By failing to timely file his federal 
income tax returns over nearly a decade, Applicant violated Title 26, United States 
Code, Sec. 7203. The variety of explanations he furnished for his lengthy period of 
inaction, indicate a lack of candor on his part, and reflect traits which raise concerns 
about his fitness to hold a security clearance.  
 
I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put 
Applicant’s credit history, with emphasis on his repeated failures to file federal and state 
income tax returns, in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this 
case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.75 His recent good-faith efforts are insufficient to mitigate continuing 
security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Although there are some positive signs, such as efforts to take corrective actions, 
file delinquent federal income tax returns, and enter into an installment agreement, with 
evidence of one payment made, these steps are simply too recent and insufficient to 
show he can “live within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations.” See 
AG ¶ 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts 
about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his 
financial considerations.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
