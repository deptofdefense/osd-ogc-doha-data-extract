Decision

O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude 
that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline for 
financial considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. 
  
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(Standard Form 86), signed on June 23, 2008, to request a security clearance required 
as part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the 
ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and

Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s request.  
 
 On June 15, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 
Applicant submitted a notarized Answer to the SOR dated January 14, 2010,3 in which 
he denied 18 allegations under Guideline F, and admitted the remaining 5, 
subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l. He also requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  
 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 26, 2010, and the 
case was assigned to me on March 12, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on 
March 25, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 8, 2010. During the 
hearing, I admitted seven government exhibits (GE), identified as GE 1 through 7. 
Applicant testified, and offered two exhibits, admitted as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and 
B. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence, but he did not 
submit further documentation. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 16, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the 
SOR, and the evidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional 
findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant, who is 48 years old, graduated high school and completed some 
college credits. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the Air Force from 
January 1981 to August 1982. Since 1991, he has worked in the information technology 
field, starting with a job at a federal agency from 1991 to 2003. Since then, he has held 
a series of temporary and short-term positions. He was unemployed for nine months 
between 2003 and 2004, and received unemployment compensation for six of those 
months. He was again unemployed for two-month periods in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He 
has held secret and top secret clearances in the past, between 1981 and 1989, with no 
security violations. He has held full-time positions since June 2008. (GE 1; Tr. 25, 27-
30) 
 
1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as 
amended. 
 
2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which were implemented by 
the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The AG supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 
2 to the Directive. 
 
3 Applicant’s earlier answers to the SOR failed to indicate admission or denial of each allegation. See GE 
3 and 4. 
 
 
3  
 Applicant attributes his financial problems to the fact that he had only temporary 
and short-term jobs for five years, 2003 to 2008. As a result, his income has been low, 
as well as unpredictable. At the same time, he has had a series of medical issues 
including gout, kidney stones, and diabetes. These conditions have interfered with his 
ability to work, and in one case caused him to be terminated because of excessive 
absences. Without full-time employment, he often did not have health insurance 
coverage for treatment and medications. Five of his debts relate to medical expenses 
(1.a., 1.n., 1.o., 1.v., and 1.w.). (GE 1; Tr. 16-22, 30, 35)   
 
 Applicant was allowed time after the hearing to provide his income, expenses, 
and budget; however, he did not forward additional information. He did testify that his 
rent is $750 per month, and his car loan is paid in full. He uses a check card, and does 
not use credit cards. (Tr. 95)  
 
 Applicant paid for financial counseling in 2009, after receiving the DOHA 
interrogatories, and signed an agreement for six months of counseling beginning March 
22, 2009. He met with the counselor three times. According to the counselor’s letter, the 
goal was to help Applicant “develop a step-by-step process to get out of debt and 
manage his money wisely.” Applicant noted in his Answer that he does “not have 
perfect credit history nor reports. I am willing to clean this up…” However, he did not 
submit documentation of payment plans, or a budget developed through counseling. On 
his counselor’s advice, he disputed numerous debts on his credit reports and informed 
the credit reporting agency. His counselor advised him that the agencies would contact 
the creditors, and any creditor with a legitimate debt would contact Applicant. (GE 2; Tr. 
81) 
 
 The 23 debts listed in the SOR total approximately $60,800. The oldest became 
delinquent in 2002. They appear in Applicant's credit reports of February and 
September 2008, and April 2009. (GE 5, 6, 7) Applicant intends to pay his delinquent 
debts. (Tr. 94) However, he disputed the validity of numerous SOR debts with the three 
credit reporting agencies. (GE 2; AE A) Based on Applicant's challenges, Experian 
credit agency deleted the following six SOR debts from Applicant's credit bureau report: 
¶¶ 1.a. ($50); 1.c. ($1,274); 1.d. ($1,145); 1.g., ($1,078); 1.h. ($1,401); and 1.k. ($389). 
Experian verified the accuracy of the following challenged SOR debts: ¶¶ 1.f. ($527); 1.i. 
($74); 1.j. ($456); 1.n. ($4,601); and 1.o. ($10,977). (AE B) The status of Applicant's 
SOR debts follows. 
 
Medical debts: Allegations 1.a. ($50), 1.n. ($4,601), 1.o. ($10,977), 1.v. ($1,204) 
and 1.w. ($2,860) – DISPUTES. Applicant attempted to pay 1.a., but the creditor 
had no record of the debt. The credit agency removed it from Applicant's credit 
report. Applicant claims that the debts at 1.n. and 1.o. are duplicates, owed to the 
same hospital for the same surgery. He does not believe he owes them because he 
had insurance coverage at the time. The credit agency’s investigation verified them 
as valid debts. Appellant stated he disputed the debts at 1.v. and 1.w., without 
further explanation or documentation. (GE 4; Tr. 36-37) 
 
 
 
4  
Federal tax lien: Allegation 1.b. ($7,410) – DISPUTES. Applicant owes back 
income taxes for tax years 1997 through 2000, when he was employed by a federal 
agency. In 2002, he arranged to have payments taken from his salary. He left that 
job in 2003. Since then, he has made a few payments, and his federal tax refunds 
have been applied to the debt. He disputes the amount, which he believes is now 
approximately $2,800. He did not supply supporting documentation. (GE 3; Tr. 44-
48) 
 
Credit cards: Allegations 1.c. ($1,274), 1.d. ($1,145), 1.e. ($773), 1.f. ($527), 1.j. 
($456), 1.k. ($389), and 1.s. ($898) – DISPUTES. Applicant obtained a settlement 
agreement of $500 in January 2010 on the debt at 1.c., and testified he has made 
one $50 payment since then. He provided no supporting documentation. He 
disputed this debt with the credit bureau, and it was deleted from his credit report. 
(AE B) He admits owing a debt to the creditor at 1.d., but not the stated amount. He 
claims he talked with the creditor, but does not have a settlement offer. He had no 
documentation. Applicant claims 1.e. and 1.k. are duplicates of the same debt, 
because the 1.k. debt was bought by the collection agency at 1.e. He testified that 
he owes less than the alleged amount of $773, and that he has not made payments 
on this debt. Applicant also believes that 1.f. and 1.j. are duplicates. He has not 
taken steps to pay this credit card, as his plan is to start with bills that are more likely 
to be negotiable. Applicant was unaware of the credit card debt at allegation 1.s. 
until March 2009 when he received the DOHA interrogatory. He has not contacted 
the creditor during the past year. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 49-59, 81-85) 
 
Communications: Allegations 1.h. ($1,401), 1.i. ($74), 1.q. ($1,489) and 1.r. 
($276) – DISPUTES. Applicant had service from the company listed at allegations 
1.h. and 1.i, He received poor service, and disputes owing the debt. He claimed to 
have documentation to support the dispute, but did not provide it after the hearing. 
He testified that he contacted the communications company at allegation 1.q. and it 
had no record of the debt. He currently has service from the company, with no 
outstanding balance. He did not provide supporting documentation after the hearing. 
Applicant denies any knowledge of the communications company listed at allegation 
1.r. He disputed this debt in his letter to the credit reporting agencies. (GE 2, 3, 4; Tr. 
60, 77-80) 
 
Insufficient funds: Allegation 1.l. ($467) – In 2004, Applicant deposited a bad 
check that he received from another person, which left his account with a negative 
balance. He noted in his statements of July and September 2009 that he had made 
payments on this debt, but at the hearing, he testified the debt is not paid. (GE 2, 3; 
Tr. 65-66) 
 
Judgment: Allegation 1.m. ($782) – The creditor sought a judgment against 
Applicant in 2002, but failed to provide adequate notice. The company garnished 
Applicant's pay in the amount of $667. Subsequently, the judgment was vacated for 
inadequate service of process. The creditor accepted the garnished amount as full 
 
 
5  
                                                     
payment. Applicant did not provide documentation after the hearing to support his 
statements. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 66-68) 
 
Auto loan: Allegation 1.o. ($28,683) – DISPUTES. Applicant purchased an 
automobile in 2001, and in 2002 requested a voluntary repossession. It was sold, 
and a deficiency was not requested. The alleged amount is the full loan amount. 
Applicant contacted the creditor in late 2009, and later, the attorney who currently 
holds the debt. They could not agree on a settlement amount. Nothing further has 
occurred and he has no documentation regarding these contacts. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 71-
76) 
 
Storage - Allegation 1.t. ($562) - Applicant stored goods from August to October 
2004. In his July and September 2009 statements, he said he would settle the debt. 
As of the hearing date, he had not contacted the creditor or resolved the debt. (GE 
3; 4; Tr. 85-86) 
 
Insurance – Allegation 1.u. ($694) - DISPUTES. Applicant paid for month-to-month 
insurance until he was dropped for non-payment. He denies owing the debt. He 
testified that he complained about the error by telephone in 2006. He provided no 
supporting documentation. (Tr. 86-88) 
 
Unrecognized debt – Allegation 1.g. ($1,078) - DISPUTES. Applicant does not 
recognize the creditor and has no knowledge of this debt. He notified the credit 
reporting agencies and Experian has deleted the account from Applicant's credit 
bureau report. (AE B; Tr. 59-60) 
 
Policies 
 
 Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, 
and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions 
must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly 
referred to as the “whole-person” concept. 
 
 The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not 
determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they 
represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties 
require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at AG ¶ 18. 
 
4 Directive 6.3 
 
 
 
6  
                                                     
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of 
producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or 
revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able 
to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it 
then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government’s case.  
 
 Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy 
burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the 
government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or his 
own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of 
any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the 
government.7 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to 
abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. 
An individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead 
to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by 
known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds 
from financially profitable criminal acts. 
 
 The evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG ¶19 (a) (inability 
or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG ¶19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial 
obligations). The SOR alleges more than $60,000 in debts, which started to become 
delinquent in 2002. Most of Applicant's debts remain unpaid, demonstrating a history of 
failure to meet financial obligations. 
 
 
 
5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). 
 
6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. 
 
7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
7  
 
 Under AG ¶ 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-
due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to 
resolve the issue. 
 
 Although Applicant's debts have been accruing for several years, they are not in 
the distant past, as they remain unpaid. This fact, along with the lack of action taken by 
Applicant, indicates that they may remain unpaid in the future. His failure to make 
consistent attempts to resolve his debts raises questions as to his reliability and 
judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part because events occurred that affected Applicant's 
finances, and which he could not control or foresee. He has serious medical issues that 
affect his financial status and are beyond his control. Although Applicant has not been 
steadily employed for several years, the specific reasons why he did not obtain 
permanent employment and how much control he had over this situation are unclear. 
He has been employed since 2008, but has done little to deal with his debts. Applicant 
has not acted responsibly to resolve his significant delinquent debt load. AG ¶ 20(b) 
applies in part because of his medical issues. 
 
 Applicant sought financial counselling and AG ¶ 20(c) applies in part. However, 
he did not seek it until March 2009, years after his financial problems arose. He sought 
help only after he received the DOHA interrogatories, indicating this action may have 
been simply a response to the security clearance process. In addition, the counselling 
did not result in a plan to satisfy his debts.  
 
 
 
8  
 To be applicable, AG ¶ 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. 
Applicant was on notice that delinquent debts were a security concern after he 
completed his security clearance application in June 2008, yet he has accomplished 
little to resolve his debts. His financial situation is not under control. Without evidence of 
a plan to resolve indebtedness, and steps taken to implement it, a good-faith effort to 
resolve debts cannot be substantiated. AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply. 
 
 Applicant disputes most of the SOR debts, either as to the debt itself, or the 
amount alleged. He provided documentation showing that he informed the credit 
reporting agencies of his disputes. As a result, several debts were deleted from his 
credit bureau report. I find for the Applicant on those debts that the credit reporting 
agency deleted following its investigation. The credit agency verified that other disputed 
debts were valid. AG ¶ 20(e) applies. 
 
 In all, the mitigation available to Applicant under AG ¶ 20(e), and partial 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b) and 20(c), are insufficient to outweigh the fact that 
Applicant has a substantial debt load, that has existed for eight years, and he has taken 
little action in that time to pay his legitimate debts or to establish a plan to resolve them. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all 
the relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the 
appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have also reviewed the 
record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the 
time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the 
presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful consideration of 
the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the appropriate guideline, I 
considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts 
and circumstances surrounding this case. 
 
 Applicant has accumulated substantial debts over the past eight years. He has 
not established payment plans, and has not provided evidence of efforts to resolve his 
financial situation. An applicant is not required to be debt-free, or establish that he paid 
every debt. But he must demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his debts 
 
 
9  
and has taken action to implement that plan. Here, Applicant has not established such a 
plan, and he still carries a significant debt load, with no documented efforts to resolve it.  
 
A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information bearing on 
Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts 
currently raised about his suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the cited 
adjudicative guideline. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b.   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 1.c. – 1.d.  For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e. -1.f.  Against Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 1.g.   For Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.h– 1.w.  Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to allow applicant access to classified information. Applicant’s request for a security 
clearance is denied.
