FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on May 15, 2009. On 
October 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 26, 2009; answered it on November 12, 
2009; and requested a determination on the record without a hearing. DOHA received 
the request on November 18, 2009. Department Counsel requested a hearing on 
 
2 
 
 
December 7, 2009, and was ready to proceed on January 11, 2010. The case was 
assigned to me on January 19, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 27, 
2010, scheduling the hearing for February 17, 2010. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1-3, 5, and 6 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. GX 4 was not admitted. Department Counsel also submitted Hearing Exhibits 
(HX) I and II, which are attached to the record. Applicant testified and submitted 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without objection. I kept the 
record open until March 5, 2010, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary 
evidence. She timely submitted AX D through M, which were admitted without objection. 
Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX D through M are attached to the record 
as HX III. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 25, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i, 
and she denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.j. Her admissions in her answer and at the 
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 50-year-old program analyst employed by a federal contractor 
since March 2009. She worked for another federal contractor as an administrative 
assistant from February 2006 until she was hired by her current employer. She received 
a security clearance in April 1991 while she was employed by the Department of the 
Navy, but it was administratively terminated when she left federal employment in 1998. 
(Tr. 15; GX 1 at 20-21.) 
 
 Applicant married in October 1978 and divorced in April 1993. She has two adult 
children. She began cohabiting and sharing living expenses with the father of her two 
sons in 2002. (Tr. 64-65.) They separated in July 2009. (Tr. 65.) An unemployed adult 
son lived with Applicant until December 2009. (Tr. 41, 66.) 
 
 Applicant purchased a home in 1998. Her financial problems began when she 
was laid off from a well-paying job in June 2001. (GX 1 at 19-20.) She then worked at a 
series of low-paying temporary jobs. Her cohabitant lost his job in 2007, and he did not 
find a new job until January 2009. (Tr. 39-40, 64-65.)  
 
Applicant did not make her mortgage payments in February and March 2009. In 
April 2009, she contacted a prospective lender with a view toward refinancing her loan. 
The prospective lender was unresponsive, and the mortgage holder obtained a 
judgment for the entire amount of the loan in August 2009. (GX 5.) Applicant contacted 
the mortgage holder in November 2009 and negotiated a loan modification (Tr. 49-55.) 
Her loan modification was completed in February 2010, and the account is now current. 
(AX A-C.) 
 
 The federal tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b arose when Applicant did not pay tax 
on rental income received in tax year 2002. A federal tax lien was filed in May 2006. 
(GX 2 at 1.) Applicant did not make any payments on the tax debt, but her income tax 
 
3 
 
 
refunds of about $1,600 per year were applied to the indebtedness. (Tr. 58, 72.) The 
seizure of her tax refunds reduced her tax indebtedness from about $8,187 in June 
2003 to $3,568 in October 2009. (AX G at 1, 3.) She contacted the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) by telephone the day before the hearing to discuss a payment plan, but 
no plan was in effect as of the hearing date. (Tr. 72-73.) After the hearing, she reached 
an agreement with the IRS to pay $200 per month, but she was unable to obtain 
documentation of her agreement before the record closed. (AX D.) Her projected 
monthly budget includes monthly payments of $200 to the IRS beginning in March 
2010. (AX L.) 
 
In December 2009, Applicant hired a law firm that specializes in debt resolution. 
She made one $896 payment to the firm in December 2009. (Tr. 59-60.) She made a 
second payment in January 2010, but she stopped payment on the check when she 
was unable to access the firm’s website and the telephone number she was given was 
disconnected. (Tr. 60; AX I.) She has since been contacted by the firm and intends to 
resume monthly payments. (Tr. 61.) The firm is handling the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c-
1.h and 1.j. 
 
 The delinquent student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i was incurred for Applicant’s 
son’s education. On February 24, 2010, Applicant began a loan rehabilitation program, 
providing for payments of $100 per month beginning in March 25, to be paid by 
automatic deduction from her checking account. She must make nine consecutive 
payments before her loan will be rehabilitated. (AX H.)

alleged in the SOR.

Applicant’s living expenses have declined substantially now that she is living 
alone. (Tr. 68-69.) Her monthly take-home pay is about $2,650. (Tr. 44.) At the hearing, 
she testified that she has a net remainder of about $200 after paying all her monthly 
expenses, including her mortgage payments and payments to the law firm. (Tr. 68.) On 
March 2, 2010, she began a part-time second job that will increase her monthly income 
by about $400 per month. (AX J; AX L.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in 
conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
 
5 
 
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Several disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG ¶ 19(a) is 
raised by an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” AG ¶ 19(c) is raised by “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” AG ¶ 19(g) is raised by “failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the 
same.” Applicant’s financial history raises AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c). Her federal tax debt 
does not raise AG ¶ 19(g), because she timely filed her returns and there is no evidence 
of fraud. 
 
 The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d are duplicates. When the same conduct 
is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations 
should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 
21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I will resolve SOR ¶ 1.a in 
Applicant’s favor.  
 
 Since the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence 
to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has 
the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts 
to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established because Applicant’s debts are ongoing, numerous, and did 
not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. She is on a tight budget, 
and the unexpected expenses or loss of employment could occur before her debts are 
fully resolved. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant’s loss of employment in 
June 2001, subsequent underemployment, her cohabitant’s loss of employment, and 
the breakup of her relationship with her cohabitant all were conditions beyond her 
control. She acted responsibly by seeking and finding other jobs, albeit temporary and 
low-paying jobs. Although several credit card accounts became delinquent, she kept her 
mortgage payments current until January 2009. Once she resolved the delinquent 
mortgage, she turned her attention to the other debts. I conclude AG ¶ 20(b) is 
established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). This 
mitigating condition is established because Applicant is working with a law firm 
specializing in debt resolution, has a realistic plan in place, and has her financial 
situation under control. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not 
mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   
 
 An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each 
and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 
2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the 
SOR be paid first. Id. 
 
 
7 
 
 
I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Most of Applicant’s actions to resolve 
the debts occurred after she received the SOR, but she began working on the 
delinquent mortgage, her largest debt, in April 2009. Until the day before the hearing, 
Applicant’s response to the tax debt was passive, allowing the IRS to seize her tax 
refunds. She did not begin exploring a payment plan until the day before the hearing, 
but she and the IRS reached agreement on a payment plan before the record closed.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). Applicant 
denied the debt for the computer purchase (SOR ¶ 1.k) in her answer to the SOR, but 
she produced no documentation to substantiate the dispute. I conclude AG ¶ 20(e) is 
not established for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k, although AG ¶ 20(d) is established as noted 
above. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a mature woman with a history of working for the federal government 
or federal contractors. She held a security clearance for several years, apparently 
without incident. All the debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent after she lost her 
job and was underemployed for several years. She has successfully avoided 
foreclosure on her home. Her debt resolution plan is reasonable and feasible. Although 
she has not yet established a track record of regular, timely payments on the student 
loans, her debt resolution plan, or her newly-modified home mortgage, she has taken 
measures such as a second part-time job to ensure that she can resolve her debts. 
 
8 
 
 
Based on her record of successful federal service and her candor and sincerity at the 
hearing, I am confident that she will carry out the agreements she has negotiated.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my 
obligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns based on her financial problems. Accordingly, I 
conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.k:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
