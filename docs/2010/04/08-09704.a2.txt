APPEAL BOARD DECISION
ON APPLICANT’S REQUEST
FOR RECONSIDERATION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
2
On March 31, 2010, the Board issued an Appeal Board Decision in this case.  On April 9,
2010, Applicant submitted a request for clarification and/or reconsideration of that decision.
Department Counsel submitted a response on April 14, 2010.  
The Board has inherent authority to entertain a request to reconsider its decisions.  However,
there is no right to reconsideration; the Board has the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise
its inherent authority to reconsider one of its decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0621 at 1-2 (App.
Bd. Nov. 23, 1999).  
We have considered Applicant’s brief and conclude that she has identified no error in our
decision.  Rather, she appears to express disagreement with our decision, submitting in support of
her request new evidence, which we cannot consider.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Accordingly,
Applicant’s request is denied.
