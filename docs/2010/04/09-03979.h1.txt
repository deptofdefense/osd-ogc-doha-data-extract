HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 15 delinquent debts totaling 
$41,667. He did not make any payments on any of his SOR debts. Ten SOR debts 
totaling $24,395 are established and not sufficiently resolved to be mitigated. He failed 
to make sufficient effort to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. Financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 15, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Item 4). November 23, 2009, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (Item 1), pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
(Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). 
 
On December 18, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and 
requested a decision on the record (Item 2). A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated January 31, 2010, was provided to him on February 16, 2010, 
and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant responded to the FORM with a letter 
with one enclosure. The case was assigned to me on April 12, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted responsibility for the ten debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i (owes $6,500 rather than $20,008), 1.j, 1.m, and 
1.n (Item 2). He denied the other five SOR allegations. His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make 
the following additional findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old manufacturing engineer, who has been employed by a 
defense contractor since February 2008.3 He was awarded his bachelor of science 
degree in mechanical engineering in May 1994. Except for being unemployed from 
October 2007 to January 2008, Applicant has been continuously employed from 
December 1997 to the present. He has never been married and does not have any 
children. He has never served in the military.    
 
Applicant did not disclose any unpaid liens, garnishments, or civil court actions. 
He did disclose debts currently over 90 days delinquent, and debts over 180 days 
delinquent in the last seven years. He did not disclose any illegal drug use, or alcohol-
related offenses on his January 15, 2009, security clearance application. He disclosed 
that $480 was garnished from his pay for past due vehicle property taxes, as well as 
four delinquent credit card debts for $950, $548, $520, and $980. He explained, “As a 
result of my job loss in 2007, I became delinquent on several of my credit card 
obligations. Now that I have obtained employment, I am working with my creditors to 
bring my accounts current. The goal is to have all accounts current by 3/31/09.” 
 
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated February 4, 2010; and Applicant’s receipt is dated February 
16, 2010 (file). The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to 
submit information (file).  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
  
3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant’s 
January 15, 2009, SF 86 (Item 4).

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s earliest credit report is dated February 24, 2009 (Item 7). It shows 12 
delinquent debts and last activity for one debt in 2003, two in 2005, and three in 2007 
(prior to October 2007, when Applicant’s unemployment began). The delinquent debts, 
last activity, and source information from his February 24, 2009 credit report is as 
follows: $1,178 (June 2003, Item 7 at 4); $21,585 (December 2008, Item 7 at 5); $1,107 
(April 2007, Item 7 at 5); $1,291 (April 2007; Item 7 at 5); $2,509 (November 2007; Item 
7 at 6); $6,512 (February 2005; Item 7 at 7); $128 (February 2008; Item 7 at 11); $454 
(June 2007; Item 7 at 13); $3,996 (February 2009, Item 7 at 14); $123 (July 2008, Item 
7 at 14); $352 (October 2005; Item 7 at 14); and $4,040 (November 2008, Item 7 at 15).   
 
Applicant’s SOR ¶¶ alleged the following delinquent debts: 1.a ($480); 1.b 
($128); 1.c ($352); 1.d ($1,447); 1.e ($1,196); 1.f ($454); 1.g ($692); 1.h ($6,512); 1.i 
($20,008); 1.j ($2,509); 1.k ($1,482); 1.l ($439); 1.m ($3,996); 1.n ($1,694); and 1.o 
($278).4   
 
For SOR ¶ 1.i, Applicant owed $20,437 for a 2006 BMW that was repossessed.5 
The creditor sold his vehicle at an auction for $14,250. On October 16, 2009, his 
balance owed to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i was $6,107. 
   
An Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant on 
March 25, 2009 (Item 4 at 9-12). The OPM investigator reviewed several of the SOR 
debts with Applicant. Applicant promised to pay his debts in the “near future.” He 
intended to use a debt consolidation program. He asserted that part of his financial 
problems was related to his sister’s inability to work because of cancer, and his 
provision of financial assistance to her (Item 4 at 9). In his FORM response, he said 
from January 2007 to September 2009, his sister, brother, and mother had major 
medical problems. He related that these medical problems caused him severe 
emotional distress and caused him to lose focus on his financial matters. The illnesses 
caused unexpected travel and support expenses to care for family members. He did not 
provide the amounts of funds expended, or dates of any expenditures caused by these 
family emergencies.6  
 
On August 21, 2009, Applicant responded to interrogatories. For 11 delinquent 
debts he explained, “I have yet to contact this creditor. They will be part of my 
consolidation plan scheduled for 9/18/09.” (Item 4).  
Applicant’s response to interrogatories said he planned to pay a 
telecommunications debt for $123 (Item 4 at 3). This $123 debt does not appear on the 
 
4Department Counsel’s FORM provided an exceptionally thorough description of the SOR debts, 
and included citations to Applicant’s various credit reports (FORM pages 3-5).   
  
5The source for facts in this paragraph is an October 16, 2009, letter from the creditor (FORM 
response, enclosure 1). 
 
6Without a more detailed description of the expenses caused by these unexpected events, it has 
not been possible to assess the degree of resulting mitigation.

SOR.  He said he planned to make a $127 payment towards a settlement of $379 on a 
collection debt of $726 (Item 4 at 3). This $726 debt does not appear on the SOR. 
Applicant said he planned to pay the $128 utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.b on August 31, 2009 
(Item 4 at 4). However, he did not provide proof of payment of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b.  
 
On December 18, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. In his SOR response, 
he did not promise to pay any of the SOR debts, or provide proof of any payments on 
his SOR debts (Item 2).  
 
The FORM cites lack of documentation showing payments, payment 
arrangements, good faith efforts to resolve debts, and financial counseling, placing 
Applicant on notice of what he needed to do to alleviate or mitigate security concerns 
(FORM at 6). The FORM response states Applicant is in contact with his creditors and 
he is trying to get payment plans established.  
 
Applicant’s file does not contain any documentary evidence that debts are paid, 
disputed,7 in established payment plans, or that Applicant has received financial 
counseling. Although not required, the file does not contain a personal financial 
statement or any letters from character references or job appraisals.  
 
Applicant concluded his FORM response with the following comments: 
 
Throughout my adult life, I have been a proud and productive citizen. I 
have never been involved in any illegal activity, and I treat all people with 
dignity and respect. I do admit that I have not been very efficient in 
handling of financial matters, but I am working to improve in that area. I 
would never do anything that would breach the security of our great 
nation, which I love dearly.  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
7Applicant’s FORM response said he disputed an education-related debt; however, this debt does 
not appear to be listed on the SOR. This creditor appears at least seven times on his February 24, 2009, 
credit report, with the highest amount owed in the amount of $9,885 with one $68 payment being over-
due (Item 7 at 9). Applicant did not provide the basis of the dispute or dispute documentation. No adverse 
inference is drawn concerning this account. It is mentioned merely to emphasize that it not being 
considered as part of this security clearance determination.  
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).

Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, responses to interrogatories, Office of Personnel Management interview, 
his SOR response, and his FORM response. His 15 delinquent SOR debts total 
$41,667. His 2006 BMW was sold at auction, and his actual debt was $6,107 rather 
than $20,008. Actually, his SOR debt total is $27,766. His SOR debts have been 
delinquent for more than a year. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions is required.   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent 
SOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by 
illnesses in his family, and his unemployment. However, there is insufficient evidence 
about these circumstances to show their effect on his financial situation, and that he 
acted responsibly under the circumstances. Five debts show a last activity prior to the 
start of his unemployment in October 2007. Moreover, one account became delinquent 
in 2003 and two accounts became delinquent in 2005 before any family members 
became ill. There is insufficient evidence he maintained contact with his creditors on 
several of his SOR debts.8 Once he learned of his delinquent debts at his OPM 
interview on March 25, 2009, and even more importantly when he responded to DOHA 
interrogatories on August 21, 2009, his documented actions were insufficient to 
establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. He did not receive financial counseling. Applicant did 
not provide a personal financial statement or budget. Applicant is well educated and he 
understands what he must do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant cannot 
receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, established payment 
plans (by making payments), adequately documented disputes of debts, or otherwise 
resolved any of his SOR debts. There are some initial, positive “indications that the 
 
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has admitted responsibility for 10 
SOR debts totaling $24,395, and documented his communication with one of them (the 
debt relating to his repossessed BMW). He also established some mitigation under AG 
¶ 20(d) by showing some good faith9 in the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting 
responsibility for 10 SOR debts, and promising to pay them. AG ¶ 20(e) is not 
applicable because Applicant did not provide documentation showing he disputed any 
of his SOR debts.   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment from 
February 2008 to the present. He did not provide proof of any payments to his SOR 
creditors. He did not provide enough information about the effect on his finances caused 
by the illness in his family. He has not provided documentation showing sufficient 
progress on his SOR debts. His documented steps are simply inadequate to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
 
9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant is 39 years old. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He has earned a bachelors of 
science degree. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the 
Department of Defense as an employee of a defense contractor. There is no evidence 
that he has ever violated security rules. There is every indication that he is loyal to the 
United States, the Department of Defense, and his employer. There is no evidence that 
he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His unemployment and illnesses in his family 
contributed to his financial woes. He communicated with several creditors and 
discussed payment arrangements. He admitted responsibility for 10 SOR debts totaling 
$24,395. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His oldest delinquent SOR 
debt became delinquent in 2003. When an OPM investigator interviewed him on March 
25, 2009, and then when he responded to DOHA interrogatories, it should have been 
evident to a person with his education and background as an engineer that delinquent 
debts were a security issue. The issue of financial considerations was further 
emphasized when he received the SOR, and again when he received the FORM. He 
had ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity to make 
greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts, or to provide adequate 
documentation to mitigate financial issues. He did not pay, start payments, document 
and justify any disputes, or otherwise resolve any SOR debts. He did not prove he 
lacked sufficient income to make greater progress resolving his debts. Applicant has not 
proven that he has an established payment plan on any SOR debts. His promises to 
pay some of the SOR debts are insufficient to mitigate these debts because there is 
insufficient evidence to explain why he has not done more to address his SOR debts 
after becoming aware that they raised a security concern.    
 
I give Applicant substantial credit for admitting 10 of his delinquent debts. 
Moreover, he admitted the largest debts and denied five of the smaller debts. The five 
debts he denied are all allegedly owed to collection companies, and as such could be 
duplications or have been transferred to different creditors. I am satisfied that he would 
have admitted the last five debts, if he had more assurance from the creditors of his 
responsibility for them. Accordingly, I find “For Applicant” on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
($480), 1.g ($692), 1.k ($1,482), 1.l ($439), and 1.o ($278).  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not fully 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on 
the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful

consideration of the whole person and Adjudicative Process factors and supporting 
evidence, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b to 1.f:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.h to 1.j:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k to 1.l:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o:   For Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
