Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire (e-QIP) on Janaury 27, 
2009. On September 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) which became effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On October 7, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
November 3, 2009. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2009. The hearing 
was originally scheduled for February 11, 2010, but was cancelled because of inclement 
weather. On February 23, 2010, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing 
for March 18, 2010. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered three 
exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 3. The Applicant 
testified and offered 11 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - K. 
 
 
 
 
2
The record was held open until April 7, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional 
documents. On April 7, 2010, I granted Applicant’s request for an extension until April 
23, 2010, to submit documents. He timely submitted five documents that were admitted 
as AE L - P. Department Counsel’s response to Applicant’s post-hearing submissions is 
marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 30, 2010.  
Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a – 1.j, 1.l -1.p, 
and 1.r.  He denies SOR allegations 1.k and 1.q   
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor.  
He has worked for his current employer for approximately 15 months. He previously 
held a security clearance about 20 years ago with another government agency. This is 
his first time applying for a Department of Defense security clearance. He is a high 
school graduate and has two years of college. He is married and has two children from 
a previous marriage, a daughter, age 14, and a son, age 10. (Tr at 6-7, 37, 40; Gov 1.)  
 
Applicant’s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has the 
following delinquent accounts: a $17,297 debt resulting from an automobile 
repossession in 2002 placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 2 at 15; Gov 3 at 5); a $519 
medical account placed for collection in September 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 16; Gov 
3 at 10); a $481 medical account, creditor unknown, placed for collection in August 
2005 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 2 at 16; Gov 3 at 8);  a $337 credit card account placed for 
collection in December 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 2 at 16; Gov 3 at 5); a credit card account

$188 television account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 2 at 16); and  a $145 
account placed for collection in November 2008. (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 2 at 17) 
 
Additional delinquent accounts include: a $91 cable television account placed for 
collection in August 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 3 at 6); a $75 medical account 
placed for collection in May 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 3 at 9); a $75 medical

18; Gov 3 at 10); and a $34 medical account placed for collection in March 2007 (SOR 
¶ 1.r: Gov 2 at 18; Gov 3 at 9).

Applicant admits that he has had a history of not knowing how to manage credit. 
His financial problems began when he was laid off in 2002. He was unemployed for 
about six months. In June 2002, his car was repossessed. This is the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 33, 80-81, 84) Applicant divorced his first wife in April 2007. His ex-wife 
agreed to pay some of the marital debt but did not abide by the agreement. Applicant is 
paying all of the marital debts. (Tr. 96-97)  
 
In July 2009, Applicant remarried. His second wife closed down her courier 
business to move to where Applicant resides. She is unemployed. She owns a home in 
another state. Applicant was responsible for the mortgage payment until they found a 
renter last month. The rent pays the mortgage payment, but Applicant is still responsible 
for the monthly $120 homeowners’ association dues. This past fall, Applicant lost a car 
when a large storm hit the area where he lived. His car was flooded. He owed $3,000 
after the insurance paid the settlement. He is making payments towards the balance. 
(Tr. 34-37, 58) 
    
Applicant’s ex-wife is unemployed. As a result, Applicant provides additional 
support for his children in addition to his $957 monthly child support. His son has 
auditory processing disorder and requires special education services. He hired a special 
education advocate to assist him with mediating with the school district to insure his son 
is being provided adequate services to meet his son’s needs. (Tr. 38-41, 52; AE F) 
 
Applicant intends to pay all of his debts. He paid off several debts that were not 
alleged in the SOR, including a debt owed to a city for unpaid automobile taxes ($265), 
a municipal sanitation company (total amount $152), and an electric utility bill ($159). 
(AE A at 2-4; AE M) He did not enter a payment agreement with his largest debt of 
$17,297, the automobile repossession alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, because a mortgage 
broker advised him on how to increase his credit rating. The mortgage broker told 
Applicant that the automobile repossession was going to be deleted soon from his credit 
report. She advised him to do nothing about the account because if he entered into a 
repayment agreement, it will negatively affect his credit report. (Tr. 33-34) 
 
The following debts are paid:   
 
SOR ¶ 1.e: $24 past due account was paid on January 11, 2010. (Tr. 61; AE C; 
AE N) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k: $91 cable television collection account was paid on June 11, 2009. 
(Tr. 76-78; AE A at 5; AE O) 
SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, three $75 copays, total amount $225 was paid on 
January 12, 2010. (Tr. 58-59; AE E) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o: $70 medical account was paid as of January 18, 2010. (Tr. 66; AE D)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.q: $49 electric utility account was paid on October 19, 2007. (Tr. 67; AE 
A at 1-2: AE M)

The names of the actual creditors for the medical accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.c, 1.h, and 1.p are not listed on the credit reports. There is no contact information for 
these creditors as well. I find for Applicant with respect to these three debts because the 
government pleading is insufficient and vague. After the hearing, Applicant disputed 
these three accounts on his credit report. (Tr. 111; AE L) 
 
The remaining debts are unresolved (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 
1.r)  Applicant intends to contact these creditors as soon as he can afford to pay. Prior 
to the hearing he had attended formal financial counseling. After the hearing, he 
indicated that he had hired a credit counselor. The credit counselor is preparing a plan 
to clean up his credit. The counselor is also going to advise him on how to manage his 
finances in the future. (Tr. 113, 121; AE P) 
 
Applicant’s net monthly income is $4,256. His regular monthly expenses include: 
rent $700, groceries $500, clothing $230, electric $260, cell phone $200, internet $35, 
car expenses $400, child support $957; church tithes $442, entertainment $260, and 
wife’s homeowner’s association fee $120. The expenses total approximately $4,104. He 
has $152 left over each month after his regular monthly expenses. (Tr. 98-109; AE K) 
 
Applicant also has several variable expenses. He paid a $375 retainer to his 
son’s special education advocate. She also charges $60 an hour for services and 
mileage of $0.45 a mile. Both of his children need dental procedures. His son’s dental 
procedure will cost $300. His daughter’s dental procedure will cost $700.  Applicant has 
one open credit card account to improve his credit rating. It has a $250 limit. The 
balance is currently $200. He pays the minimal payment. Applicant recently purchased 
a 1995 Chevy Astro van from a friend for $2,000. He agreed to make payments to his 
friend when he is able to afford it.  The balance on the loan is $1,600. His wife has 
credit cards. He pays the minimum payment on his wife’s credit cards. He does not 
know the balance of his wife’s credit cards. (Tr. 106-119, 125) 
 
A security assistant in the Facility and Support office of Applicant’s company 
wrote a letter on Applicant’s behalf.  He states that Applicant has worked diligently 
towards a resolution of all outstanding matters associated with his request for a security 
clearance. Applicant’s performance has been outstanding on the Government contracts 
he supports. (AE G) 
 
Applicant’s pastor wrote a letter on his behalf. Applicant serves a minister, and a 
pastor’s assistant representative man who reviews the church’s financial forms and the 
church’s weekly kitchen report for accuracy. His pastor states that Applicant is a 
wonderful young man and an asset to the church.  In calendar year 2009, Applicant paid 
$6,265.75 to the church in total charitable contributions consisting of tithes and church 
rallies. (AE H)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to 
brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG 
&19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. 
Applicant has had financial difficulties for several years. The SOR alleged 18  
delinquent accounts, a total approximate balance of $20,186. Of that amount, $17,297 
relates to the automobile repossession alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.  
 
The government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. AG ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long 
ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment) is not applicable. Applicant has had difficulty meeting his financial obligations 
for a number of years. Fourteen of the 18 delinquent debts are under $200 which 
indicates a pattern of financial neglect as opposed to being unable to pay. Applicant’s 
current financial situation remains precarious. He is the sole income provider for his 
family. He has the added responsibility of supporting his new wife and assuming her 
debts because she does not work. Applicant’s expenses currently exceed his income.   
Applicant’s unresolved debts raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.  
 
 AG & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant was unemployed 
 
 
 
 
7
for six months in 2002, which resulted in his car being repossessed. He was divorced in       
2007. His son requires special education services. Applicant had to hire an advocate in 
order to assist in obtaining the services his son needs for an appropriate education. 
However, I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances 
because he has been gainfully employed since 2002. He continued to incur additional 
delinquent accounts while employed. Most of these debts have low balances and could 
have been gradually paid off over time with some adjustments to Applicant’s 
discretionary expenses. Aside from the $17,297 car repossession alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a,  
the total amount of the remaining delinquent accounts totaled $2,889. Applicant has 
been financially irresponsible for a number of years. While circumstances beyond his 
control contributed to his financial problems, he has not acted responsibly with regards 
to resolving his delinquent accounts and managing his financial situation.   
 
AG ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) 
does not apply. Before the hearing, Applicant consulted a mortgage broker on how to 
clean up his credit in order to qualify for a home. After the hearing he indicated that he 
hired a financial counselor. While this is a step in the right direction, it is too soon to 
conclude Applicant will follow the advice provided by the financial counselor. While 
Applicant has paid several debts and intends to pay his remaining unresolved debts in 
the future, it is unlikely Applicant’s financial problems will be resolved in the near future 
because he remains financially overextended.  
 
AG & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.k, 
1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o and 1.q.  He also paid several accounts that were not alleged in the 
SOR.  Eight delinquent accounts remain unresolved. 
 
While Applicant acknowledges his financial problems and resolved several 
accounts, his financial situation remains a security concern. Applicant has not mitigated 
the concerns raised under Guideline F.  
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
 
 
 
8
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s six-month 
period of unemployment in 2002. I considered his divorce in April 2007. I considered 
that he is the sole provider for his two children because his ex-wife is currently 
unemployed. I considered the added expense of caring for his son’s special education 
needs. I considered that his wife is currently unemployed. While Applicant paid off 
several debts including debts that were not included in the SOR, he operates a negative 
monthly balance based on the information he provided about his finances during the 
hearing. Although he assumed responsibility for his wife’s debts when they married 
because of her unemployment, he was unable to provide the balance of his wife’s credit 
card accounts during the hearing. It is unlikely that he will resolve the remaining debts in 
the near future based on his current financial situation. While there were mitigating 
circumstances in this case, doubts remain regarding Applicant’s financial situation. 
Mindful of my responsibility to rule in favor of the national interest in cases where there 
is doubt, I find Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.   
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a – 1.b:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant   
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f -1.g:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.i -1.j:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.k – 1.q:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.r:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
