Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence
shows Applicant has a history of financial problems. He attributes the financial problems
to periods of unemployment and underemployment during late 2001 to mid-2004. He
has been working as a software engineer, his career field, since mid-2004 earning at
least $50,000 annually, and his current annual salary is about $80,000. He married for
the first time in 2008. Applicant has made progress in addressing his delinquent debts,
but the progress is of recent vintage and he has substantial work to do. The record
contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns
stemming from his history of financial problems. Accordingly, as explained below, this
case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They
replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on August 28,1
2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a
complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline
known as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the
case be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke
Applicant’s security clearance.  
Applicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me October 19, 2009. The hearing took place November 18,
2009. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received December 7, 2009.    
Findings of Fact
Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is presently
employed as a software engineer, and he earns an annual salary of about $80,000. He
married for the first time in 2008. There are no minor children living in his household.
His employment history includes active duty military service in the U.S. Air Force, when
he held a security clearance. His employment history also includes periods of
unemployment and underemployment.
Applicant worked continuously as a software engineer from about 1995 until
about December 2001, when he was laid off by his then employer. As a result, he was
unemployed for the next year. He worked again as a software engineer for about four
months in early 2003. He was then unemployed during June 2003 to October 2003, a
period of about five months. Frustrated and unable to find steady employment as a
software engineer, Applicant worked jobs at a fast-food restaurant and a department
store from November 2003 to May 2004. He resumed working as a software engineer in
June 2004, and he has earned at least $50,000 annually since then.  
Applicant has a history of financial problems (delinquent consumer debt), which
he does not dispute. He attributes his financial problems to periods of unemployment
and underemployment. He used credit cards during this time to meet his financial
3
obligations and living expenses. As a result, he incurred more credit card debt than he
was able to repay. 
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts with various creditors for a total of
approximately $65,000. Most remain unpaid and delinquent, but Applicant has made
progress in resolving some of the debts. The current status of the debts is summarized
in the table below. 
SOR Allegation Current Status

¶ 1.j–delinquent debt of $5,754. Unresolved collection account. It appears
in a Jan. 2009 credit report, but not in an
Oct. 2009 credit report. (Exhibits 5 and E;

in a Jan. 2009 credit report, but not in an
Oct. 2009 credit report (Exhibits 5 and E;
Tr. 56–58)
To sum up, five accounts are resolved and seven remain outstanding. Applicant
paid, settled, or otherwise resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, and the
debt in ¶ 1.d is a duplicate. (A good part of this debt was resolved by accounts dropping
off credit reports.) The debts in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.k are collection accounts in
repayment plans. He began the repayment plans in August and September 2009, and
the total balance due on these four debts is approximately $28,000. For the debts in ¶¶
1.i, 1.j, and 1.l, two are unresolved collection accounts and one is an unpaid collection
account for a total balance due of approximately $11,000. In total, Applicant has
approximately $39,000 in delinquent debt he has yet to resolve.  
It appears Applicant and his wife are currently living within their means. His wife
is employed outside the home. She is earning about $20,000 annually. His financial
assets consist of approximately $1,000 in a savings account, $500 in a checking
account, and $4,500 in a retirement account.2
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is
to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As3
noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,4

any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified
information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An5
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  6
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting7
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An8
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate9
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme10
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12
The Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant
and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-
person concept. 
A person granted access to classified information enters into a special
relationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree
of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified
information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination

of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the13
strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant14
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security
concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under
Guideline F is that: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  15
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information.   
The record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as shown by the more than $39,000 in delinquent debt that he is
now facing. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of16 17
Guideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions, and they suggest some financial irresponsibility as well.  
Under Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns.18
The six conditions are as follows: 
(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
7
(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts;
(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The record evidence supports a conclusion that both ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d) apply in
mitigation. It is apparent that Applicant’s financial problems stem from periods of
unemployment and underemployment. These were circumstances largely beyond his
control and he did not act irresponsibly during his period; instead, he did the best he
could under difficult circumstances. Applicant also receives credit for his efforts to
address his financial problems. 
Although he presented evidence in mitigation, the credit in mitigation is
insufficient to overcome the security concerns. His financial problems date to the period
of late 2001 to mid-2004, which is now several years ago. He has worked as a software
engineer since June 2004, earning at least $50,000 annually since then. Despite
working full-time for more than five years, he has made little progress in resolving his
financial problems. For example, the four debts in repayment plans are recent
developments, beginning in August and September 2009.  
Looking forward, based on the more than $39,000 in delinquent debt that
Applicant is still facing and his sporadic payment record over the last five years, it is too
soon to rule out the likelihood of additional financial problems. What is missing here is a
well-established track record of repayment of his delinquent debts. Although he may
have good intentions, his track record at this point is insufficient to make any safe
predictive judgments about the future.   
To conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant’s ongoing
financial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due

consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence.19
Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a
favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1h: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
