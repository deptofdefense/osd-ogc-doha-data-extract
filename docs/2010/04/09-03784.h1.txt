HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 14 debts totaling $41,191. He did 
not make any payments on any of his SOR debts. Eleven SOR debts totaling $28,023 
are established and not sufficiently resolved to be mitigated. He failed to make sufficient 
effort to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 31, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
December 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and 
modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on 
December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On January 13, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
(HE 3). On February 2, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed 
on his case. On March 12, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On March 19, 
2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). On April 7, 2010, Applicant’s hearing was 
held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) (Tr. 15-16), and 
Applicant offered one exhibit (Tr. 18; AE A). There were no objections, and I admitted 
GE 1-6 (Tr. 16) and AE A (Tr. 18). Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, 
response to the SOR, and a chart showing the status of Applicant’s SOR debts as 
hearing exhibits (Tr. 16-18; HE 1-4). On April 14, 2010, I received the transcript.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted that he owed the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.n (HE 3). He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b that he intentionally 
provided false information on his July 31, 2008, SF 86. His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a government contractor (Tr. 20; SF 86). 
He was born in South Korea and came to the United States in 1990 (Tr. 20; SF 86). He 
graduated from high school in 1995 (SF 86). He completed about two years of college, 
where he majored in computer science (Tr. 6, 20). He became a U.S. citizen in 2003 
(SF 86). Applicant has held two jobs in the security area for about two years (Tr. 23-24; 
SF 86). He works about 70-80 hours per week (Tr. 23-24; SF 86). He makes $11.50 an 
hour on one job, and $15.50 an hour on the other job (Tr. 26). Applicant has never 
served in the military (Tr. 23; SF 86). 
 
Applicant’s spouse was born in South Korea (SF 86). She entered the United 
States in January 2002. She is a registered alien (SF 86). She has applied for 
permanent residence in the United States (Tr. 22). Applicant married his spouse in 
January 2005 (Tr. 21; SF 86). She is not employed outside their home (Tr. 22). Their 
child was born in 2005 (Tr. 21; SF 86).  
 
Applicant did not disclose any unpaid liens, garnishments, or civil court actions 
(SF 86).2 He did not disclose any illegal drug use, or alcohol-related offenses on his 
July 31, 2008, security clearance application.

information is available in the cited exhibits.

Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR lists 14 debts totaling $41,191 as follows: 1.a (medical debt—$747) (Tr. 
26-28); 1.b (medical debt—$137) (Tr. 27-28); 1.c (telecommunications debt—$153) (Tr. 
29); 1.d (credit card—$581) (Tr. 29); 1.e (credit card—$2,761) (Tr. 30); 1.f (credit card—
$625) (Tr. 30-31); 1.g (credit card—$485) (Tr. 31); 1.h (collection company—$172) (Tr. 
31); 1.i (collection account—$2,760) (Tr. 32); 1.j (vehicle loan—$19,000) (Tr. 32); 1.k 
(telecommunications debt—$157) (Tr. 33-35); 1.l (telecommunications debt—$250); 
1.m (telecommunications debt—$70) (Tr. 35); and 1.n (vehicle loan—$13,293) (Tr. 36).   
 
Applicant thought the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($2,761) and 1.i ($2,760) were the 
same account (Tr. 32). The name of the creditor is the same, and the amounts are very 
close. I conclude the debts are a duplication of each other.     
 
The vehicle loan in SOR ¶ 1.j ($19,000) involved a repossessed vehicle (Tr. 32).  
Applicant bought a vehicle and was only able to make payments for eight months (GE 
2). The vehicle was repossessed in November 2006 (GE 2). He received a letter from 
the creditor indicating the vehicle was auctioned, and he thought the balance was about 
$9,000 (GE 2).   
 
Applicant called the creditor for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k ($157) and 1.l ($250), 
and the creditor said they could not locate the debts (Tr. 34). He has never seen any 
bills from the creditor (Tr. 34-35).    
 
The vehicle loan in SOR ¶ 1.n ($13,293) involved a vehicle that was wrecked in 
November 2004 (Tr. 36-37). Applicant’s vehicle was not insured (Tr. 37). In January 
2007, Applicant’s claim was settled and Applicant received $12,000 (Tr. 38). Applicant 
did not use the money to pay his car loan, and instead used it to purchase a new 
vehicle (Tr. 38). Applicant recognized that he made the wrong decision with the funds 
he received (Tr. 39-40).  
 
Applicant has only one current credit card (Tr. 43-44). The balance on his credit 
card is $750 (Tr. 44). It is the only account where he is making monthly payments (Tr. 
44). He has about $500 in his checking account (Tr. 45). He does not have a retirement 
account or a savings account (Tr. 45). Applicant has a 2000 Toyota, which is paid off 
(Tr. 46).      
 
An Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant on 
September 4, 2008 (GE 5). Applicant discussed his two major debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.j 
($19,000) and 1.n ($13,293), as well as several smaller debts. Applicant said he was 
considering a debt consolidation plan to resolve his debts (GE 5).   
 
2Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant’s 
July 31, 2008 SF 86 (GE 1).

Applicant’s monthly gross salary is $4,080; his net monthly salary is $3,480; his 
monthly expenses are $3,125; and his net remainder is $355 (Tr. 40-45).3 He has not 
had financial counseling (Tr. 47). He did not pay any of his SOR debts (Tr. 47).  
 
Applicant enlisted in the Army (Tr. 47; AE A). He begins basic training on June 
29, 2010 (Tr. 48). He chose a military occupational specialty (MOS) of power generator 
equipment repair (Tr. 69). His MOS options were limited because of his security 
clearance problems (Tr. 69). He joined the Army because he wanted to improve his life 
(Tr. 48). He was willing to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan (Tr. 57).    
  
Failure to disclose delinquent debts and vehicle repossession on his security 
clearance application 
 
On July 31, 2008, Applicant completed his security clearance application and 
indicated in section 27 that he did not have any property repossessed for any reason 
(SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. 26, 54; GE 1). In section 28, he denied that he had debts currently over 
90 days delinquent, or debts over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years (SOR ¶ 
2.b; Tr. 26, 52; GE 1).  
 
In regard to Applicant’s failure to disclose his delinquent debts, Applicant 
explained that he was well aware that he had not paid some of his debt for more than 
90 days. He was simply careless when he completed his SF 86 (Tr. 52, 56). Most of the 
answers on his SF 86 were “no,” and he just continued to answer “no” to all of the 
questions (Tr. 52-53). He read quickly, saw the word “delinquent”, thought that 
“delinquent” did not apply to him, and checked “no” (Tr. 58-59). He never used the word, 
“delinquent” in his life (Tr. 60).4 Also he was working so many hours, he was “burned 
out” and “like a walking zombie” from working two jobs (Tr. 53). He was not able to think 
straight (Tr. 53). He sincerely regretted his carelessness (Tr. 53, 56). 
 
For Applicant’s failure to disclose that he had a vehicle repossessed, he 
explained that he thought the question was asking about foreclosures, and that 
repossessions referred to a creditor taking a house (Tr. 54-55).  
 
Applicant denied that he attempted to conceal the information about his financial 
problems because he was worried about the impact on his employment or security 
clearance (Tr. 56). At the time he completed the SF 86, he did not believe financial 
matters were that important for deciding whether a security clearance should be 
approved (Tr. 56).  
 
 
3Applicant told the OPM investigator that after deducting expenses from his net income he had a 
remainder of $240 (GE 5). On June 25, 2009, he indicated in a personal financial statement that he had a 
remainder of $202 after deducting expenses from his net income (GE 2).  
   
4It is apparent from his statement at his hearing, and his letter responding to DOHA 
interrogatories that Applicant’s vocabulary in English is limited (GE 2). I found his statement about not 
understanding the terms delinquencies in relation to debts and repossessions in relation to property on 
his SF 86 to be credible.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR lists 14 debts totaling $41,191. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l, 
totaling about $400 are not established. Applicant called the creditor and the creditor 
could not locate the accounts. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($2,761) and 1.i ($2,760) are a 
duplication of each other. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j is overstated because it is $9,000 
rather than $19,000. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j receives a credit of $10,000 for the auction 
of Applicant’s repossessed vehicle. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.   
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent 
SOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) has limited applicability. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged 
by insufficient income and underemployment. His lack of income is not unexpected. 
Moreover, there is insufficient evidence about these circumstances to show that he 
acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is insufficient evidence he maintained 
contact with his creditors on several of his SOR debts.5 Applicant was aware of his 
 
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

delinquent debts when he completed his security clearance application on July 31, 
2008. He became aware that his delinquent debts were a security concern during his 
OPM interview on September 4, 2008, and even more importantly when he responded 
to DOHA interrogatories on June 26, 2009. His documented actions were insufficient to 
establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. He did not receive financial counseling. Applicant did 
not provide a plan to resolve his delinquent debts. His personal financial statement or 
budget indicated he had $200-$300 available to begin a payment plan. Applicant 
understands what he must do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant cannot 
receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, established payment 
plans (by making payments), adequately documented disputes of debts, or otherwise 
resolved any of his SOR debts (except for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i (duplication), 1.k (not 
established), and 1.l (not established). There are some initial, positive “indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has admitted responsibility for 11 
SOR debts, and deducting $10,000 from SOR ¶ 1.j results in a total of $28,023 in 
delinquent SOR debt. He also established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) by 
showing some good faith6 in the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting responsibility 
for 11 SOR debts, and promising to pay them. AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable because 
Applicant did not provide documentation showing he disputed any of his SOR debts.   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment for the last 
18 months. He did not provide proof of any payments to his SOR creditors. He has not 
provided documentation showing sufficient progress on his SOR debts. His documented 
steps are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
 
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process the 
adjudication of Applicant’s security clearance in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
On July 31, 2008, Applicant completed his security clearance application. He 
indicated he did not have any debts currently delinquent over 90 days, debts delinquent 
over 180 days in the last seven years, or property repossessed by creditors. This 
information was false. Applicant knew he had creditors, who had not received payments 
in over 90 days. He knew that a creditor recovered one of his cars, and sold it at auction 
at the time he completed his SF 86. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) apply. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this 
case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
AG ¶ 17(f) applies.7 Applicant quickly completed his SF 86 and answered “no” to 
questions about delinquent debts and repossessed property without carefully 
considering whether he should answer “yes.” He did not understand the term 
“delinquent” or “repossession.” His difficulty with English vocabulary was evident during 
his hearing and in GE 2. He had been working two jobs, 70-80 hours per week for 
months. He was exhausted from overwork. He was careless. His falsification of his SF 
86 was not deliberate or with intent to deceive. He disclosed his financial problems in 
detail to an OPM investigator on September 8, 2008. The allegation that he deliberately 
falsified his SF 86 is not substantiated.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
 
7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant is 33 years old. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit 
for volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an employee of a defense 
contractor. He recently enlisted in the Army and will start basic training on June 29, 
2010. There is no evidence that he has ever violated security rules. There is every 
indication that he is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, and his 
employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His under- 
employment contributed to his financial woes. He admitted responsibility for 11 SOR 
debts totaling $28,023. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He has had financial 
problems despite being employed for 18 months. His personal financial statement 
showed he had $200 to $300 remainder to address his SOR debts; however, there was 
no evidence of a single payment to his SOR creditors. When an OPM investigator 
interviewed him on September 4, 2008, and then when he responded to DOHA 
interrogatories on June 26, 2009, it should have been evident to him that delinquent 
debts were a security issue. The issue of financial considerations was further 
emphasized when he received the SOR, yet he did not make any payments to his 
creditors. He had ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity 
to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He did not pay, start 
payments, document and justify any disputes, or otherwise resolve any SOR debts. He 
did not prove he lacked sufficient income to make greater progress resolving his debts. 
Applicant has not proven that he has an established payment plan on any SOR debts. 
His promises to pay some of the SOR debts are insufficient to mitigate these debts 
because there is insufficient evidence to explain why he has not done more to address 
his SOR debts after becoming aware that they raised a security concern.    
 
I give Appellant substantial credit for admitting 11 of his delinquent debts. 
Moreover, he admitted the largest debts and denied two small debts for $157 and $250. 
He also asserted one debt was a duplication of another debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.i). I am 
satisfied that he would have admitted these debts, if he had more assurance from the 
creditors of his responsibility for them. Accordingly, I find “For Applicant” on the debts in 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($2,760), 1.k ($157), and 1.l ($250). I have also credited him in SOR ¶ 1.j 
with $10,000 received for auctioning his repossessed vehicle; however, this debt is not 
mitigated because he still owes $9,000 and has no payment plan to resolve this debt. 
  
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
the personal conduct security concerns; however, he has not mitigated financial 
considerations concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in 
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the 
whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors 
under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the 
Guidelines. Applicant has not fully mitigated or overcome the Government’s case. For 
the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.h: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:   For Applicant (duplicates 1.e) 
Subparagraph 1.j:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k and 1.l: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
