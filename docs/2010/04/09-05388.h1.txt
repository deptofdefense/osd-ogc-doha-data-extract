HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists three debts totaling $34,483. She 
settled and paid one debt. Another debt was cancelled. She has paid all of the third 
SOR debt except for $1,283, which will be paid at the end of April 2010. Financial 
considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 4, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86). (GE 1) On 
December 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and 
modified; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on 
December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On December 29, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On January 19, 2010, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On January 26, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to 
me. On February 19, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On March 9, 2010, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits 
(GE 1-6) (Tr. 16-17), and Applicant offered eight exhibits. (Tr. 18-21; AE A-H) There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A-H. (Tr. 17, 21) Additionally, I 
admitted the hearing notice, SOR, response to the SOR, and Department Counsel’s 
response to Applicant’s post-hearing documents. (HE 1-4) On March 17, 2010, I 
received the transcript. On April 14, 2010, I received 27 pages of documents from 
Department Counsel, who previously received them from Applicant on April 9, 2010. 
(AE I) Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of AE I. (HE 4) AE I is 
admitted into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact1

Applicant did not disclose any unpaid liens, garnishments, or civil court actions 
on her security clearance application. She did not disclose any unpaid taxes or 
bankruptcies. She did disclose numerous debts that were either currently over 90 days 
delinquent, or over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years. She also disclosed the 
judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,953). She did not disclose any illegal drug use, or alcohol-
related offenses.      
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR lists three credit card debts totaling $34,483 as follows: 1.a ($6,953); 
1.b ($16,186); and 1.c ($11,344). (Tr. 51-52) The status of those three SOR debts are 
as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,953)—Resolved (PAID). On February 16, 2010, Applicant settled 
the $6,953 credit card debt for a single payment of $4,000. (Tr. 42; AE A at 1, 9) The 
creditor provided a letter indicating the debt was resolved. (AE A at 2) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($16,186)—Resolved (PAYMENT PLAN). The credit card creditor in 
SOR ¶ 1.b offered to settle the $16,186 debt for a $500 payment in February and 
another $500 payment in March 2010. A $6,283 payment was due by April 24, 2010. 
(AE B at 2) Applicant made the two $500 payments as agreed. (Tr. 43; AE B at 1, 2, 3, 
4) On April 10, 2010, she paid the creditor $5,000. (AE I at 2, 19) She will send the 
remainder of $1,283 on April 24, 2010. (AE I at 2) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c ($11,344)—Resolved (CANCELLED). On November 9, 2008, the 
credit card company cancelled the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 52-53; AE C at 1, 2; AE I at 6) 
She tried to pay the creditor after the debt was cancelled; however, the creditor refused 
to accept her offer. (Tr. 53) The creditor sent Applicant an Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) form 1099-C to ensure Applicant paid taxes on the cancelled debt. (Tr. 52; AE C 
at 2; AE I at 7) On April 2, 2010, Applicant amended her 2008 federal tax return and 
sent an additional $1,095 to the IRS. (Tr. 55-56; AE I at 7-11)  She sent letters to the 
credit reporting companies to ensure the account was removed from her credit reports. 
(Tr. 56-58; AE I at 20-21)   
 
Applicant’s husband of almost 20 years was removed from their residence in 
February 2004 because of domestic violence. (Tr. 22) Her husband quit his job, and the 
family’s income went from $100,000 to $15,000. (Tr. 22, 26) Applicant used credit cards 
to sustain the family because her employment was inadequate to financially sustain her 
family. (Tr. 22) She was earning about $8 per hour as a physical therapist. (Tr. 27) She 
needed to make repairs on their home before it could be sold. (Tr. 23) In August 2005, 
she sold her house and made a $35,000 profit. (Tr. 30, 31) 
 
Applicant had kidney stones, cysts, and mysterious blood in her urine. (Tr. 69-71) 
Sometimes her medical insurance did not pay the medical bills. (Tr. 69-70) The doctors 
had difficulty diagnosing the source and determining the treatment for her medical 
problems. (Tr. 69-70) She paid the medical bills whenever she could not otherwise 
resolve them. (Tr. 70-71) Her son had medical problems which caused behavioral 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
issues and additional expenses. (Tr. 66-69) Her son smashed holes in the walls and set 
fires in their home. (Tr. 68) He had to leave the local public schools, and he was 
committed to a psychiatric institution. (Tr. 67) He now lives in a different state from 
Applicant. 
 
Applicant used $15,000 of the $35,000 she received from the sale of her home to 
pay her credit card debts. (Tr. 31) She saved the remainder for family expenses. (Tr. 
31) Applicant quit her job because she was so upset about all the financial and familial 
stress in her life. (Tr. 23) She made payments to the creditors at a hardship level from 
2005 to 2006. (Tr. 23, 34, 35; AE I at 12-18) Her husband did not pay alimony or child 
support. (Tr. 24) 
 
Applicant moved to a different state and held temporary employment positions. 
(Tr. 28) She paid an attorney $1,000 to assist with her divorce issues and debts. (Tr. 24, 
36) In November 2006, her attorney sent letters to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c. 
(Tr. 35; GE 2) In April 2007, her attorney sent a letter to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. 
36) In July 2008, she sent a letter to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b and made a settlement 
offer; however, she did not receive a response from the creditor. (Tr. 38) In 2009, 
Applicant sent her attorney her credit report and information on her debts; however, he 
did not respond to her requests for information. (Tr. 37)   
 
Applicant moved to the East Coast and held several different jobs in health 
services and teaching. (Tr. 29-30) She also helped her children with some of their 
finances even though they were adults. (Tr. 25)   
 
Applicant completed her bachelor’s degree and now owes $30,000 in student 
loans. (Tr. 32) Her student loans are current. (Tr. 32) On June 16, 2009, Applicant and 
her husband closed on a house. (Tr. 41) Her $2,400 monthly house payment is current. 
(Tr. 41-42) Her monthly car payment on a Honda is $798, and it is current. (Tr. 45) 
 
Applicant received financial counseling from three different sources, including the 
Dave Ramsey program. (Tr. 58-62; AE I at 24-25) Her most recent financial counseling 
was at a base in February 2009. (Tr. 61; AE I at 23) She generated a budget. (AE I at 
26-27) Applicant and her husband’s net monthly pay is about $10,000. (Tr. 45) He is a 
major in the Marine Corps. (HE 3) They have sufficient income to pay the SOR debts as 
well as to maintain her other debts in current status. She promised to maintain financial 
responsibility and avoid future delinquent debts.  
 
Applicant provided character references from her colleagues and supervisors at 
work. (AE D, E, F, G) They described her as hardworking, honest, friendly, responsible, 
and diligent. Applicant has been and will continue to be a valuable resource to her 
company.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this 
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 08-
06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 
2009).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her security clearance application, her SOR response, and her statement 
at her hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR lists three debts totaling $34,483. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c 
($11,344) was cancelled on November 9, 2008, leaving $23,139 in unresolved 
delinquent debt. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct warrants full application of AG ¶ 20(b). Her marriage of 
almost 20 years ended in divorce and her son was having significant psychiatric 
problems. Her estranged husband quit his job and was not providing financial support. 
Applicant was ill and physicians were unable to properly diagnose and treat her medical 
problems. Applicant was unemployed or underemployed. Her lack of income was 
unexpected. Nevertheless, she showed responsibility, self-discipline, and tenacity in 
maintaining contact with her creditors and making hardship payments.3 She acted 
aggressively and conscientiously to resolve her delinquent debts. She fully disclosed 
her delinquent debts and the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a when she completed her security 
clearance application. She established that she acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.    
 
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling. Applicant 
created a plan to resolve her delinquent debts and followed through with it, 
accomplishing complete resolution of two debts and payment of all except $1,283 of the 
third SOR debt. Applicant understands what she must do to maintain her financial 
responsibility.  
 
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)) A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Applicant also established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) by showing some 
good-faith4 in the resolution of her SOR debts by admitting responsibility for them and 
paying or resolving over 95% of her delinquent SOR debts. The last 5% of her 
delinquent SOR debt should be paid by the end of April 2010.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. Applicant admitted her responsibility for all of her 
debts. Applicant did not provide documentation showing she disputed any of her SOR 
debts.   
 
In sum, Applicant diligently and responsibly resolved her delinquent SOR debts. 
She has had steady employment for the last 15 months, and she used a large portion of 
her income to pay her creditors. She provided documentary proof of debt resolution. 
Financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c) I have incorporated my comments 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as

under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
significant; however, they do not warrant revocation of her security clearance. 
Applicant’s failure to pay or resolve her just debts in accordance with contracts she 
signed was not prudent or responsible. She has a history of financial problems. Her 
credit reports, security clearance application, and SOR response listed delinquent debts 
including one judgment.  
      
The rationale for granting or reinstating Applicant’s clearance is more substantial. 
She was forthright and candid in her security clearance application, her responses to 
DOHA interrogatories, her SOR response, and at her hearing about her financial 
problems. Several problems beyond her control adversely affected her financial status. 
Her debts resulted from divorce, underemployment, unemployment, her medical 
problems, and her son’s medical problems. Of her three SOR debts, one was paid, one 
was cancelled, and $1,283 remains to be paid on her third debt.  All of her SOR debts 
should be resolved by the end of April 2010. Her mortgage, car loan, and student loans 
are all current. I am confident she will keep her promise to avoid future delinquent debt. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR.

Applicant is 48 years old. She has achieved some important educational and 
employment goals, demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. Her 
financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond her control, rather than by 
her misconduct or irresponsible spending. Applicant is an intelligent person, and she

understands how to budget and what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. There is simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment.  
 
Applicant has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through 
her service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. Character witnesses 
described Applicant as professional, honest, and diligent. Her evaluations document her 
solid work performance and good character. She is an asset to her employer. Her 
security clearance application does not list any reportable incidents involving illegal 
drugs, alcohol, the police, or courts.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors,”5 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. I conclude 
Applicant has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate the financial 
considerations security concerns. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for 
access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
