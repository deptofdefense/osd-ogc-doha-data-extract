Decision

RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under 
Guidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective 
within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 24, 2009, and requested an 
expedited hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
February 1, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 4, 2010. I convened 
the hearing as scheduled on February 16, 2010. Applicant waived her right to 15 days

notice. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. Applicant did not object and 
they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through O, which 
were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
February 22, 2010.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding allegation ¶ 1.h, to wit: 
“failed to file her annual federal income tax returns, as required, for 2001, 2002, 2003, 
2004, and 2005.” Applicant did not object. Applicant was given the opportunity to 
postpone the remainder of hearing for at least 15 days to provide her with proper notice 
and time to prepare her response to the additional allegation. She understood her rights 
and agreed to proceed. The record was held open until March 3, 2010, to allow her to 
submit any additional information or documentation. She provided AE P through II.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 
and 1.g. At her hearing she admitted SOR ¶1.h. After a thorough and careful review of 
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is 55 years old. She is not married and has no children. She is a 
college graduate and has completed some post-graduate courses. She worked 19 
years for the federal government and resigned in June 1999, due to health reasons. 
She held a secret security clearance while employed by the federal government. She 
then began a career as a real estate agent. She worked for a company from 1999 to 
2002. She changed companies and worked for a new employer from March 2002 to 
March 2008. In March 2008, she left the real estate business and began working for a 
federal contractor until April 2009. She was unemployed from April 2009 to September 
2009. She stated she did not terminate her employment under adverse conditions, but 
rather it was a job that did not suit her expertise and she was “involuntarily let go.”2 She 
obtained new employment with a federal contractor in September 2009, and worked 
until January 2010. She was offered a better job in December 2009, but it is contingent 
upon her obtaining a security clearance.3 Applicant stated that although she was 
employed after 2002, her income was reduced due to the economic climate of the real 
estate market.4 
 
 Applicant broke her ankle in 2001, and she required three and a half months to 
recover. She did not earn any income while she was convalescing. In 2002, she had 
1 Tr. 126-135. 
 
2 Tr. 83. 
 
3 Department Counsel provided information that Applicant is properly sponsored for a security clearance 
and there is proper jurisdiction in this case.  
 
4 Tr. 40-42, 77-88; AE J.

medical issues that required two surgeries and she could not work most of the year 
because she was physically unable. In 2003, a ten-year relationship with a partner she 
lived with ended, and she had to establish a separate household. She stated this 
negatively impacted her finances. In 2005 and 2006, she stated the real estate market 
was declining and it affected her finances. She decided to leave the real estate 
business sometime in 2008.5 
 
 Applicant did not file her 2001 federal income taxes on time. She explained that 
she broke her ankle and had surgery in March 2001, and then got “sidetracked” from 
filing.6 Applicant did not file her 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 federal income tax returns 
on time. She explained, “I will say that it was like an ostrich with the head in the sand. I 
felt overwhelmed.”7 She also explained, “I was so overwhelmed with my illness and the 
real estate market wasn’t doing well.”8 Due to her illness she was trying to stabilize 
herself. She admitted she did not address her delinquent taxes until she was attempting 
to file for bankruptcy in 2007, so she could save her house from foreclosure.9  
 
Applicant first attempted to file for bankruptcy in early 2007, and the IRS objected 
to the filing until Applicant filed her delinquent federal tax returns for 2001, 2002, 2003, 
2004, and 2005. She had not addressed her delinquent taxes before then. She 
understood that she was required to file her taxes each year, and had done so before 
2001. She did not have money withheld from her income during the years she did not 
file. As part of her answer to the SOR, she provided a document from the IRS dated 
February 6, 2009. It stated that Applicant, through her attorney, submitted all personal 
financial disclosure documents on December 29, 2008. Her case was then assigned to 
a revenue officer for processing. The matter was being reviewed in order to make 
payment arrangements. The letter noted Applicant was cooperative and had some 
extenuating circumstances.10 
 
Applicant provided a letter included with her answer to the SOR, and attached to 
Interrogatories to DOHA, dated September 12, 2008. 11 She stated:  
 
My finances have been stabilized since I secured a full-time position at 
[Company] on 31 March 2008. Prior to this I was self-employed as a Real 
Estate Associate Broker. The [r]eal [e]state market suffered through the

for full-time employment and my savings depleted. 
 
* * * 
 
With a stable income I have been able to effectively meet my monthly 
obligations and begin to save in [Company’s] 401K and investment 
programs.  
 
Thank you for reviewing my financial status as I have accomplished 
correcting and stabilizing my financial future with capturing a great 
employment opportunity with [Company] working on [military] [s]ystems. 
 
In the same letter, Applicant also mentioned two accounts that were listed on her credit 
report. She made a hand written notation that arrangements were made to pay one 
account and the other was paid. She did not mention or address her delinquent tax 
debts.  
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR dated March 24, 2009, she stated:  
 
I found myself in a situation owing back taxes. I experienced illness that 
required several surgeries. Once I got back to work I found myself trying to 
catch up on my bills. I later was diagnosed with diabetes and required 
constant medical monitoring and expensive drugs to maintain my health. 
Paying my back taxes is one of the most important actions that face me. I 
contacted the Internal Revenue Services to initiate a payment 
arrangement. I have enclosed a letter from [the] Internal Revenue Service 
dated February 6, 2009, expressing my efforts to resolve this matter and 
establish a payment arrangement. Payment arrangements should be 
finalized during the week of March 30, 2009. 
 
Applicant stated she set up a voluntary payment plan in April 2009, with the IRS. 
She was unable to implement the plan because she was unemployed until September 
2009. She stated she made a payment of $100 in 2008 to the IRS and another $50 
payment some other time.12 Applicant’s case was temporarily closed by the IRS on April 
29, 2009, and listed as “currently not collectible.” She was advised that she still owed 
the delinquent taxes and penalties, and interest would continue to accrue. In addition, 
she was advised that offsets of future tax refunds would be applied and her case was 
subject to re-opening if her situation improved.13 Applicant did not contact the IRS to 
begin payments when she got a job in September 2009 because she did not think she 
would be staying in the job.14 She contacted the IRS in January 2010, to obtain a new

balance on the amount of delinquent taxes she owes. A balance was not provided 
because the case in currently closed. She has not made any other payments.15  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c listed a delinquent balance for Applicant’s federal income taxes of 
$62,802. She believes the amount is about a $61,000, but did not provide documentary 
proof. Applicant was collecting unemployment benefits, when she was not working. 
Applicant stated she filed her 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax returns on time.16 Applicant 
provided proof she filed her 2007 and 2008 federal tax returns on time. Her 2006 federal 
income tax return was filed on July 16, 2007.17 She provided documentation to show 
she filed her 2001 and 2003 federal income tax returns on August 3, 2007. She filed her 
2002 federal income tax return on August 11, 2007. She filed her 2004 and 2005 federal 
income tax returns on July 16, 2007.18  
 
Applicant was delinquent in filing her state income tax returns for tax years 2001, 
2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. She did not file her state income tax return for 2006 until 
July 16, 2007, when the deadline for filing was April 15th. Applicant provided copies of 
her 2001 through 2008 state income tax returns. She filed her 2001 and 2003 state 
income tax returns on August 3, 2007. She filed her 2002 state income tax return on 
August 11, 2007. She filed her 2004, 2005, and 2006 state income tax returns on July 
16, 2007. Her 2007 and 2008 state income tax returns were filed on time. She did not 
provide proof that she has paid the state income tax she owes.19  
 
Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed in June 2007 and dismissed in 
August 2007. She filed another petition on September 17, 2007. She completed the 
mandatory credit counseling. Under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured 
Nonpriority Claims, she listed consumer debt as $31,522.20 She filed an Amended 
Chapter 13 plan on February 18, 2008. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed on 
April 9, 2008. Applicant stated she has also participated in credit counseling with a 
private enterprise that has helped her file the delinquent taxes returns. Applicant stated 
that she has settled or paid the creditors that were listed in the bankruptcy.21

disqualifying purposes. However, I will consider it when analyzing her credibility, her financial situation, 
and the “whole-person.”

Applicant purchased a house in 2003. The cost was $311,000. She paid $9,000 
for the down payment. She stated she also paid the closing costs on the house, which 
was 6% of the cost of the house. She did not explain whether she actually paid $18,660, 
or if it was included in the financing. She explained that she had the funds for the 
payments from the equity in a house she had sold. When asked why she bought a 
home in 2003, instead of renting and paying her taxes, she stated, ”I’ve always owned a 
house ever since I was 29 years old. And I’ve always lived in a house.”22  
 
Applicant stated she withdrew the balance of her 401(k) retirement account. She 
paid the taxes and penalty associated with the withdrawal. She used the money from 
the account to pay her mortgage and for another debt not listed on the SOR.23 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($786) was incurred in approximately 2007. Applicant 
stated she contacted the creditor twice in July 2008. She admitted she owes the debt 
and it is not paid.24  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($845) was for a membership to a direct buying service. 
Applicant advised the creditor she would pay $50 a month on the debt beginning on 
February 26, 2010. No payments have been made at the time of the hearing.25  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($178) was for medical services. Applicant stated she did 
not have health insurance for a period of time and paid many medical debts, but she is 
discovering other ones. She explained she would contact the credit bureau to determine 
what company owns this debt. She has not yet done so. The government conceded 
they did not know the name of the creditor.26  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($299) was incurred in September 2006, when Applicant 
purchased two 32-inch flat screen televisions at a cost of $1,799 for both. She stated 
the debt is no longer on her credit report and she paid the remaining balance. Applicant 
provided evidence, in her answer to the SOR, that there is a remaining balance of $75 
owed on this debt. She purchased the item when the real estate market was depressed 
and she was not earning significant income.27  
 
 Applicant provided a copy of her work performance evaluation for the period of 
November 1997 to May 1998. It stated she was a dynamic professional who

demonstrated intelligence and poise.28 Character letters described her as trustworthy, 
hard working, and capable of interacting with all levels of the command. She was 
respected for her honesty and integrity, consistently showing good judgment and 
maintaining a high ethical standard.29 
 
Applicant explained that she has handled the financial aspects of real estate 
transactions and she has high standards. She maintains a budget on a spreadsheet. 
She owes some personal loans from her family, but does not owe any other delinquent 
debts, nor does she have any new delinquent debts. She intends to pay her delinquent 
debts.30  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”

A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
Appellant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid. She failed to timely file her 
federal tax returns for tax years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. She filed them in 
2007. Her delinquent federal taxes remain unpaid. I find there is sufficient evidence to 
raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
 
9 
 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating 
conditions under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant’s behavior is recent because her delinquent debts remain current and 
unpaid. They are not isolated. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. 
 
 Applicant broke her ankle in 2001 and was unable to work for three and a half 
months. In 2002, she experienced other medical problems. In addition, the real estate 
market was depressed and her ten-year personal relationship ended. These events 
impacted her finances and she fell behind in paying her bills. These circumstances were 
beyond her control. She subsequently addressed and paid some of the bills. From 2001 
to 2005, she failed to file her federal and state income tax returns on time. She did not 
address her tax problems until she attempted to file bankruptcy and they became an 
issue. She eventually filed her delinquent returns in 2007. Some of the conditions 
regarding he finances were beyond her control and raise the application of mitigating 
condition (b). However, her failure to file her federal income tax returns was within her 
control. In order for mitigating condition (b) to be fully applicable, Applicant must have 
acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant continued to ignore her 
obligations to file her federal tax returns for six years. She did not address her taxes 
until she was thwarted from filing for bankruptcy. Her conduct continued for years, 
despite her admission that she was aware of her legal obligation to file her taxes on 
time. Exacerbating the problem was the fact she did not have any taxes withheld from 
her income while she was employed. Although she has been working with the IRS to 
resolve her problems, she did not notify them when she went back to work in 
September 2009, to begin payments. She owes more than $61,000 with interest and 
penalties continuing to accrue. Applicant has other debts that also have not been 
resolved. Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances because she 
 
10 
 
 
ignored her tax obligations for six years. Therefore, I find mitigating condition (b) only 
partially applies.  
 
 Applicant stated she received financial counseling and she has a budget. 
Applicant has delinquent debts that are not resolved and her federal tax debt remains 
significant and unpaid. I find there are not clear indications the problem is being 
resolved. Although she has been cooperative with the IRS and mentioned a payment 
plan, nothing has been implemented and no payments have been made, other than two 
previous payments totaling $150 .Applicant was working for several months and did not 
begin making payments. At this juncture, she has not made a good-faith effort to resolve 
her delinquent debts or made progress in reducing her tax debt. It is too early to 
conclude that the problem is resolved or under control. I find mitigating conditions (c) 
and (d) do not apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant left federal employment 
and entered the real estate business. Due to economic conditions, the sale of real 
estate decreased and affected her financial stability. She also experienced serious 
medical issues that prevented her from working for a period of time, along with the 
termination of a ten-year relationship and incurrence of additional living expenses. 
These factors impacted her ability to pay her debts on time. The most serious and 
significant debt is her delinquent taxes. Applicant failed to act responsibly in filing her 
federal and state income tax returns for six years. Although, her personal situation may 
have contributed to an initial delay, she later failed to comply and ignored her 
responsibility after she obtained employment and her health improved. At this time, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
 
11 
 
 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to 
mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:   Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
