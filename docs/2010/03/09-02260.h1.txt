HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant admitted owing 27 past due, charged-off, or placed for collection 
accounts, which totaled $39,000. Additionally, he has a mortgage arrearage of $31,000. 
Two days before the hearing, he filed for bankruptcy protection. Applicant has failed to 
rebut or mitigate the government’s security concerns under financial considerations. 
Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his 
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order 
and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a

Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 28, 2009, detailing security concerns under 
financial considerations. 
  
 On August 14, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On 
September 1, 2009, I was assigned the case. On September 2, 2009, DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing. The hearing was held as scheduled on September 24, 2009.  
 
 At the hearing, the government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 11, which were 
admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A 
through C, which were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow 
Applicant to submit additional information. On October 6, 2009, additional material was 
submitted and admitted into the record as Ex. 12. On October 2, 2009, the transcript 
(Tr.) was received. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR ¶ 1.u 
and ¶ 1.aa. He admitted the remaining factual allegations, with explanations. Applicant’s 
admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of 
the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 54-year-old systems administrator who has worked for a defense 
contractor since June 1983, and is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance. His 
annual salary is $64,000. (Tr. 29) 
 
 Applicant and his wife have five children. His children are ages 27, 22, 17, and 
twins at 15. (Tr. 30) Applicant’s wife was on maternity leave from January 1994 through 
July 1994 with the twin boys. (Ex. 5, Tr. 26) Applicant’s annual salary at the time was 
$48,000; his wife’s salary was $42,000 for a combined annual household income of 
$90,000 per year. (Tr. 29) Following the birth of the children, his wife was out of work for 
one year before obtaining a job paying $42,000 annually. (Tr. 27) 
 
In June 1994, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. 
(Ex. 4) In September 1994, their debts were discharged and the bankruptcy was closed 
in November 1994. Credit card accounts were discharged. (Ex. 5) No medical bills were 
listed in the bankruptcy. In July 1994, Applicant completed a signed, sworn statement 
concerning his finances. He also completed a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) 
which listed his monthly net remainder (monthly income less monthly expenses and 
monthly debt payment) of $1,800. (Ex. 6) Applicant owed approximately $18,000 on two 
time shares and $10,000 on credit cards. He tried, but was unsuccessful, to sell the time 
shares. 
 
 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

In 1997, one of Applicant’s twins became ill and was diagnosed with Crohn’s 
Disease. In 1999, the other twin was similarly diagnosed. In 2004, both had their colons 
removed and were in the hospital for six weeks. One has been hospitalized 19 times 
and the other 22 times. (Answer to SOR) Applicant’s insurance covered approximately 
seventy percent to eighty percent of the provided costs. (Tr. 25) His current insurance 
pays “practically 100 percent on everything.” (Tr. 34) Applicant asserts the medical bill 
for his sons was $400,000. (Tr. 25) His portion of the medical expenses was $38,000, 
which he paid. (Tr. 42) Since their colectomies five years ago, there have been no 
significant medical expenses. (Tr. 41)  
 
In September 2004, the Social Security Administration ruled both children were 
disabled and entitled to Supplemental Security Income payments. (Ex. B, C) However, 
Applicant’s income was too great to allow supplemental income and they have received 
no social security payments. (Tr. 30, 37) 
 
In October 2001, Applicant completed another signed, sworn statement 
concerning his finances. (Ex. 8) He completed a PFS showing a monthly net remainder 
of $183. (Ex. 8) Applicant asserts he was financially responsible following the 1994 
bankruptcy until 1998, when he incurred between $12,000 and $15,000 in medical 
expenses not covered by insurance due to his sons’ Crohn’s Disease. (Ex.8) In 1999, 
another $5,000 was incurred and in 2000, an additional $2,600, all in uninsured medical 
expenses. At the time of the hearing, the twins were age 15 and doing better. (Tr. 25)  
 
In December 2000, Applicant was involved in a rear-end vehicle accident. He 
purchased a new 2000 Chevrolet van for $36,000 requiring a $778 monthly payment. 
Applicant expected to receive an insurance check between $10,000 and $13,000 for the 
damage to their vehicle, which would be paid on the new vehicle. (Ex. 8) The record is 
silent as to any insurance money being used on the purchase. As of October 2001, 
Applicant was thinking of filing a lawsuit against the other driver. (Ex. 8) In June 2001, 
Applicant refinanced his home paying the first and second mortgages and incurring a 
new $96,000 mortgage.  
 
In February 2005, the van engine blew up and cost $9,500 to replace the engine. 
(Ex. 11) This unpaid debt ($7,752) was listed in SOR ¶ 1.f. From 1995 until July 2006,2 
his wife was working for a defense contractor with an annual salary of $37,000. (Ex. 11, 
Tr. 27) In 2006, she became a teacher assistant with monthly salary of $700. Her 
previous monthly pay had been $2,800. 
 
Two and one-half years ago, Applicant went to credit counselors and it was 
recommended he file bankruptcy. (Tr. 40) He started the filing, and then stopped. (Tr. 
40) In May 2009, Applicant answered financial interrogatories. He completed a PFS 
showing his monthly expenses and debt payment exceeded his income by $2,000 per 
month. (Ex. 11) His mortgage had increased to $128,000. Applicant indicated his 
2 In Ex. 11, answer to interrogatories, Applicant stated, “in July 2006 my wife was laid off due to military 
spending cuts, she was making around $37,000 a year.” At the hearing, he asserts she was laid off in 
2004. (Tr. 27)  
 
4 
 
financial status was bad and he was past due on his mortgage payments, medical bills, 
personal loans, and credit card payments. (Ex. 8) In May 2009, he stated he was again 
contemplating filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. In September 2009, two days prior 
to the hearing Applicant filed a Chapter 13 Wage Earner’s plan. (Ex. 12)  
 
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in an attempt to save his 
home from foreclosure. The plan listed $226,000 in liabilities, $160,000 in assets, and 
$47,000 in unsecured debts. Of the unsecured debts, nine debts totaling approximately 
$3,800 are medical debts. The bankruptcy schedules indicate he was $31,000 in 
arrears on his $146,000 mortgage. His monthly mortgage payments are $1,172. (Ex. 
11, p. 2) To be $31,000 in arrears, Applicant must be in excess of a year behind on his 
mortgage payments. The house had been purchased in 1983 for $87,000. (Tr. 33) In 
September 2009, as required for the bankruptcy, Applicant and his wife received credit 
counseling. (Ex. 12)  
 
As of September 2009, when the bankruptcy was filed, Applicant’s and his wife’s 
combined average monthly income was approximately $5,300. The five-year Chapter 
13 Wage Earner’s Plan requires Applicant to make $2,220 monthly payments, which 
includes the mortgage payment of $1,310. (Tr. 32) The plan will run for five years with 
payment starting 30 days after it is filed. (Tr. 32) Four of the SOR debts totaling 
approximately $1,200 do not appear on the bankruptcy schedules. Those debts are: 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($696), SOR ¶ 1.g ($343), SOR ¶ 1.l ($93), and SOR ¶ 1.n ($65). 
 
Applicant denies two of the debts: the $2,000 bank account placed for collection 
(SOR ¶ 1.u) and the $3,006 bank account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.aa). (Tr. 36) 
The two bank accounts, though listed under different bank names, are the same loan as 
evidenced by Applicant’s credit bureau report (CBR). In his May 2009 response to a 
financial interrogatory (Ex. 11), he listed the $2,000 debt as a loan taken out to pay for 
transmission repairs. The repair shop invoice reflects the bill was paid by credit card. 
(Ex. 11) In March 2007, Applicant obtained a $3,006 bank loan to pay for vehicle repair, 
which required $125 monthly payments. (Ex. 11) Applicant’s September 2007 CBR lists 
the loan as being paid “as agreed” for five months. (Ex. 11, p. 149) The balance on the 
loan was then $2,630. (Ex. 11, p. 149) Neither account appears on his March 2009 
CBR. (Ex. 10)  
 
The SOR alleges 28 accounts placed for collection or charged off, which total 
approximately $39,000 plus past due mortgage payments. Two of the SOR debts (SOR 
¶ 1.u and SOR ¶ 1.aa) represent the same obligation. Applicant’s mortgage, as 
evidenced by the bankruptcy schedules, was $31,000 delinquent. Ten of the SOR debts 
totaling approximately $4,000 are medical debts. Eleven debts were $500 or less, which 
totaled $3,700. Those debts were: SOR ¶ 1.b ($438), SOR ¶ 1.g ($343), SOR ¶ 1.m 
($165), SOR ¶ 1.p ($239), SOR ¶ 1.q ($390), SOR ¶ 1.r ($500), SOR ¶ 1.s ($280), SOR 
¶ 1.t ($416), SOR ¶ 1.v ($270), SOR ¶ 1.y ($360), and SOR ¶ 1.bb ($315). Another five 
debts were each less than $100, which totaled $400. Those debts were: SOR ¶ 1.d 
($73), SOR ¶ 1.h ($82), SOR ¶ 1.k ($82), SOR ¶ 1.l ($93), and SOR ¶ 1.n ($65)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered 
in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns 
relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of 
financial problems. He admitted owing 27 past due, charged-off, or placed for collection 
accounts, which totaled $39,000. Additionally, he admitted owing past due mortgage 
payments, which were listed in the SOR at $19,000 and in the bankruptcy schedules at 
$31,000. Sixteen of Applicant’s debts were for $500 or less and together totaled 
approximately $4,000. Applicant has had to resort to bankruptcy protection twice. 
Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and AG 
¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
7 
 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and, 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he did 
not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant=s debts are numerous and 
recent. Only $4,000 of the total debt is medical debt. The balance of the SOR debts, 
more than $66,000, represents his delinquent mortgage and other delinquent debts. His 
mortgage delinquency is $31,000. Part of the delinquency would include penalties and 
other fees, but even with penalties, fees, and additions, Applicant is more than a year 
and a half behind on his mortgage.  
 
Starting in 1994, Applicant was asked to explain his financial problems. Since 
2005, Applicant’s and his wife’s combined joint income was, until 2006, approximately 
$100,000, yet 16 of the SOR totaling approximately $4,000 remain unpaid. There is 
nothing in the record to show the debts occurred under such circumstances that they 
are unlikely to recur.  
 
In 1994 and 1995, Applicant’s wife was unemployed for approximately one year 
after the birth of the twins. Before the twins were born, their combined joint annual 
income was $90,000. In July 2006, his wife’s income was reduced from $2,800 to $700 
monthly. Applicant has experienced some vehicle problems. In December 2000, 
Applicant was in a rear-end accident and he purchased a new van. His insurance paid 
between $10,000 and $13,000 for the damage and he was contemplating suing the 
other driver. In February 2005, the van’s engine needed $9,500 in repairs. In March 
2007, the van required $2,000 worth of transmission repairs.  
 
Applicant’s twins were born in 1994 and suffered from Crohn’s Disease. 
Applicant’s portion of the medical bills incurred amounted to $38,000, which he has 
paid. Since their colectomies five years ago, there have been no significant medical 
expenses. Additionally, Applicant’s current insurance pays “practically 100 percent on 
everything.”  
 
8 
 
                                                          
The year of unemployment following the birth of the twins, his wife’s recent 
reduction in pay when laid-off from her contractor job, the vehicle repairs, and the 
medical bills related to his twins physical problems are all conditions which are beyond 
Applicant’s control, and AG & 20(b) partially applies. However, his wife’s unemployment 
following the birth of the twins ended 14 years ago. New medical expenses for the twins 
ended five years ago. Additionally, only $4,000 of the SOR debt, which totals $70,000, 
was medically related. The car expenses occurred two, five, and nine years ago. From 
1995 until July 2006, Applicant and his wife were making $90,000 to $100,000 annually.  
 
In September 2009, Applicant and his wife received credit counseling as required 
by the bankruptcy court. The nature of the counseling, or what Applicant learned from 
the counseling, is not part of the record. It is too early to state there are clear indications 
that Applicant’s financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG & 20(c) 
does not apply.  
 
 Applicant has paid none of the debts, even the five debts that were less than 
$100 each. AG & 20(d) does not apply. For AG¶ 20 (d) to apply there must be an 
“ability” to repay the debts, the “desire” to repay, and evidence of a good faith3 effort to 
repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts is needed, which is not 
present here. 
Applicant’s actions fall short of demonstrating a track record of financial reform 
and rehabilitation sufficient to permit the conclusion that Applicant’s history of financial 
difficulties will be resolved soon and will not recur. Two days prior the hearing, Applicant 
filed for bankruptcy protection. The five-year Wage Earner’s Plan requires Applicant to 
pay $2,220 per month to begin 30 days after the filing. The record contains no evidence 
Applicant has made any payments in accordance with the plan. The debts have yet to 
be discharged. Without any track record, it is speculative that he would be able to 
successful complete the plan. It is noted Applicant had five accounts placed for 
collection which totaled less than $400, which he was unable to pay. Additionally, he 
failed to pay his monthly mortgage payments for 18 months incurring a mortgage 
arrearage of $31,000.  
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
9 
 
Applicant's act of filing for bankruptcy, even if he should receive a discharge of 
debts, does not preclude assessing the security significance of Applicant's overall 
history of financial problems, including evidence indicating that he had been less than 
diligent in addressing his longstanding financial problems. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-
0349 at p. 3 (App. Bd. February 3, 1999). 
A discharge in bankruptcy may give a person a financial fresh start, but it does 
not substitute for evidence of a demonstrated track record of financial reform, which is 
necessary to satisfy Applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue access to classified information for him. See 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 15. Nor does a discharge in bankruptcy 
immunize an applicant's history of financial problems from being considered for its 
security significance. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 87-1800 at p. 3 n.2 (App. Bd. 
February 14, 1989) ("Although bankruptcy may be a legal and legitimate way for an 
applicant to handle his financial problems, the Examiner must consider the possible 
security implications of the history of financial debts and problems that led to the filing of 
bankruptcy. Furthermore, a discharge in bankruptcy does not, in itself, prove that an 
applicant has changed the financial habits that led to the debts discharged in 
bankruptcy or that his past financial difficulties are not likely to recur."). Cf. Marshall v. 
District of Columbia Government, 559 F.2d 726, 729-30 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (discharge in 
bankruptcy does not preclude city from considering whether past financial problems 
disqualify person for position as police officer). 
 At some future date, his debts may be discharged. Applicant’s bankruptcy is not 
held against him. I find for him as to SOR ¶ 1.cc. I also find for him as to SOR ¶ 1.bb, 
the bank loan which was listed twice.  
AG & 20(e) has limited application because Applicant is not disputing the 
legitimacy of the past-due debts. He denied two debts because he only had one bank 
loan. I find for Applicant as to SOR & 1. bb ($3,006) as Applicant’s 2007 CBR shows he 
was paying this debt as agreed and it does not appear on his 2009 CBR. Additionally, 
the two bank accounts (SOR ¶ 1.u and SOR ¶ 1.aa), although they have different bank 
names, are indeed the same accounts.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
 
10 
 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had financial 
problems since 1994. His sons’ medical problems added to his financial difficulties, but 
his medical debts essentially ended five years ago and his current insurance pays 
almost 100 percent of the medical expenses. In July 2006, his wife’s income decreased, 
but they had financial problems even during the period their combined annual income 
was $90,000 to $100,000. Applicant’s financial problems have been so severe that he 
has been unable to pay his mortgage for more than a year.  
 
 Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is no clear 
indication that his financial problem is being resolved or is under control. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.
