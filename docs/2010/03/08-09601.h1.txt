GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 6, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
 
2 
                                      
 
                                                          
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
On December 29, 2005, the President promulgated revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information, and on 
August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a 
memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative Guidelines 
(hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive 
and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the SOR was issued 
on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s case because his 
SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 3, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated March 16, 2009, but notarized March 23, 2009, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on April 2, 2009, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the FORM on December 1, 
2009,1 and no submission was made by the December 31, 2009, deadline. The case 
was assigned to me on March 5, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a. 
and 1.b. of the SOR, and denied the remaining allegation. 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
an ROTC Administrative Technician,2 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. 
He has never had a security clearance.3 Applicant never served with the U.S. military, 
but was a Deputy Sheriff for 27 years before he retired in October 2007.4  He married in 
1985, and is the father of four children, born in 1986, 1987, 1992, and 1995, 
respectively, all of whom reside with Applicant and his spouse.5 They have resided in 
the same house since 1992.6 
 
1 There is nothing in the case file explaining the unusual period of delay between the April 2009 submission 
of the FORM to Applicant and his December 2009 receipt of same.

Upon his retirement from the county sheriff’s department in October 2007, and 
continuing until he secured his present position in June 2008, although he was receiving 
his retirement pension, Applicant had the misfortune of being unemployed.7 
 
At about the time Applicant married, he and his wife made “a conscious choice 
that [he] would work and she would stay at home so as to not have someone else rear 
[their] children.”8 Nevertheless, she apparently has served as a substitute teacher in the 
city school system. Over the years, he supplemented his county income by taking part-
time jobs “to make ends meet.”9 One of those jobs was running the family trucking 
business.10 Business eventually improved and control was involuntarily relinquished to 
Applicant’s father and siblings.11 Unfortunately, less than a year after relinquishing 
control, the business essentially failed.12  
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2003. At some 
point however, his salaries from his Deputy Sheriff’s position and other part-time 
positions were insufficient to meet the family obligations, and bills eventually became 
delinquent.  On July 6, 2003, with estimated debts between $100,000 to $500,000, and 
an estimated number of creditors of between 16 and 49, as well as estimated assets of 
$100,000 to $500,000, Applicant filed an individual Voluntary Petition for bankruptcy 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.13 The debts were characterized as “business” 
rather than “consumer/non-business.”14 Of the 16 creditors holding unsecured 
nonpriority claims listed on the Schedule F of the Voluntary Petition, totaling 
$107,713.95,15 all but two of the 16 creditors appear to be business-related, with those 
two referring to claims totaling $1,088 for dental or medical services.16 One of the 
claims was from Applicant’s father, in the amount of $13,000.00.17 A judgment on the

and Applicant has admitted the allegation containing those estimates, the extract of the bankruptcy file in evidence 
does not support those numbers. Furthermore, the totals set forth in Schedule F – Creditors Holding Unsecured 
Nonpriority Claims of the Voluntary Petition are apparently inaccurate as well. Id. 3-5. No other schedules from the 
Voluntary Petition are in evidence.

claim, in the amount of $15,738 was filed in June 2003.18 Applicant’s debts were 
discharged on Octob 19
 
Less than five years later, with estimated debts, primarily consumer debts rather 
than business debts, between $100,000 to $500,000, and an estimated number of 
creditors of between 1 and 49, as well as estimated assets of $100,000 to $500,000, on 
June 11, 2008, Applicant and his wife filed a joint Voluntary Petition for bankruptcy 
under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.20 The Summary of Schedules listed assets, 
including real and personal property, in the amount of $118,100, and liabilities in the 
amount of $143,382.95.21 Among the secured liability claims are a mortgage 
($87,370.30), 2nd mortgage ($15,888.79), and judgment lien ($8,370.46) on the family 
residence, totaling $111,629.55; and loans for a 2001 Volkswagen and 2002 Jeep, 
totaling $19,873.61.22 The unsecured nonpriority claims listed on the Schedule F of the 
Voluntary Petition, totaling $11,879.79, appear to be for such things as cell phone 
service, parking tickets, professional dental service, cable service, and other 
unspecified purposes.23 The Chapter 13 Plan was filed on August 1, 2008, with a 
schedule of payments which supposedly commenced on July 12, 2008.24 The Plan was 
approved by the Standing Trustee and ordered by the court.25 The term of the Plan is 
60 months.26 There is no evidence to indicate Applicant has complied with the payment 
terms of the Plan. 
 
According to the Schedule I – Current Income of Individual Debtor(s) of his 
Chapter 13 Voluntary Petition, Applicant was receiving $1,600.50 as a monthly 
retirement pension, and his wife was earning $1,342 monthly gross salary. Their 
combined average net monthly income as of June 2008 was $2,781.33.27 Six months 
later, in December 2008, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement to DOHA, 
which reflected a combined monthly income of $2,778, not including his retirement 
pension.28 Applicant listed two debts (the mortgage and 2nd mortgage) with monthly

payments totaling $1,035, in addition to his normal monthly expenses of $1,605 
(including $705 of monthly payments under the terms of his bankruptcy), leaving a 
monthly net remainder of $138 available for discretionary spending.29 It remains unclear 
as to why his pension is no longer included in his available monthly income. 
 
The SOR contained one additional allegation identified as an account with the 
local public library, in the amount of $100, placed for collection in September 2007.30 
Applicant denied responsibility for the overdue book charges and collection fee, 
attributing those charges to his two younger children who purportedly used his library 
card to check out books without his knowledge.31 He claims to have worked out a 
payment plan with those children (now 18 and 15, respectively), and expected the debt 
to be resolved by the end of March 2009.32 There is no evidence that the debt has been 
paid to the creditor. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”33 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”34   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and

commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”35 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government’s 
case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.36  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”37 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
35 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial condition initially collapsed in 2003, when he 
became involved in the family trucking business and incurred substantial business-
related indebtedness. Accounts became delinquent and his liabilities increased to over 
$100,000. Unable to resolve his delinquent accounts, despite still holding a position as a 
Deputy Sheriff, he turned to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code for relief. The result was 
the discharge of his unsecured nonpriority liabilities. That enabled him to start all over 
with a clean financial slate.   
 
Nevertheless, more financial obligations were created, and once again, become 
delinquent because of his inability to satisfy them. His financial difficulties were 
exacerbated with his retirement from the county sheriff’s department in October 2007, 
and his subsequent unemployment until June 2008. As noted above, that same month, 
Applicant was receiving a $1,600.50 monthly retirement pension, and his wife was 
earning $1,342 monthly gross salary. Their combined average net monthly income as of 
June 2008 was $2,781.33. Later that month, Applicant increased his monthly income 
when he accepted his new position. However, Applicant’s financial difficulties caused 
his delinquent debts to increase to $143,382.95, and once again, he turned to the 
Bankruptcy Code for relief. What was initially, purportedly a willingness, accompanied 
by an inability, to satisfy debts, became more clearly an ability, accompanied by an 
apparent reluctance, to satisfy them.  AG && 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
& 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that 
resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
 
8 
                                      
 
                                                          
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ 
Applicant=s financial situation collapsed in June 2003, but was restored with his 
bankruptcy discharge in October 2003. Thereafter, he continued to accumulate 
substantial delinquent debt, due in some measure to eight months of unemployment. It 
should not be overlooked, however, that despite his period of unemployment, Applicant 
continued to draw his pension. In June 2008, the same month he obtained a new job, 
Applicant, once again, filed for bankruptcy protection, this time under Chapter 13 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. His liabilities during the previous five years rose to $143,382.95. 
Those new debts constituted “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence.39 The unemployment circumstances have not been present since 2008, 
and both he and his wife have been gainfully employed. Nevertheless, his refusal or 
inability to address his financial delinquencies between 2003 and 2008, along with his 
refusal to address something as minor as the delinquent charges with the local library, 
raises concerns about recurrence of delinquent debts and his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence fails to establish AG ¶ 20(a). While the 
evidence regarding the period leading up to the 2003 bankruptcy initially established AG 
¶ 20(b), the evidence of events since 2003 vitiates the applicability of this mitigating 
condition.40  
 
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ 
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the 
evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.@41 There is no evidence to indicate Applicant ever received 
counseling in handling his finances, or guidance on how to address financial 
delinquencies, or getting his financial problems under control. Likewise, other than 
seeking protection under the Bankruptcy Code on two separate occasions, nearly five 
years apart, and getting his earlier delinquencies discharged in 2003, there is credible 
39 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 16, 2002)). 
 
40 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).  
 
41 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

evidence Applicant initiated a good-faith effort in 2008 to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve his debts, but there is no evidence to reflect actual payments under 
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The evidence fails to establish AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 
20(d). 
 
Considering Applicant’s extensive financial delinquencies, one of which 
continues unaddressed, and his spending of discretionary funds for everything but his 
overdue debts, Applicant has not demonstrated his financial responsibility.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When these 
problems first began, Applicant was a Deputy Sheriff and his wife was a substitute 
teacher in the local school system. He took control of the family trucking business and 
nursed it to success, only to lose control to his family, who eventually destroyed the 
business, leaving Applicant with business-related delinquencies. Unable to meet the 
family financial obligations, in October 2003, his debts were discharged in bankruptcy. 
Four years later, he retired from the county sheriff’s department and started drawing his 
pension. He also endured an 8-month period of unemployment. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
While the unemployment was a circumstance beyond his control, Applicant continued to 
draw his pension and obtained services and goods from a wide variety of creditors, but 
either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he accumulated extensive 
new delinquent debt. (See AG & 2(a)(1) and AG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant and his wife have 
been gainfully employed. While their combined net monthly income in December 2008 
was $2,778, not including his pension, he refused to make any good-faith efforts to pay 
a variety of delinquent debts until he chose to do so under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. Instead, he preferred to wait to pay delinquent debts at a very moderate rate over

the course of 60 months. (See AG & 2(a)(6), AG & 2(a)(7), and AG & 2(a)(9).) While 
these debts may eventually be paid off, his failure to repay creditors in a more timely 
manner reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security 
clearance.  
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether 
his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. 
I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.42 Considering what Applicant had gone through financially and emotionally, 
and mindful of his 2003 and 2008 bankruptcies, intermediate clean slate, the absence of 
any earlier good-faith efforts, and his failure to address his library debt, his current 
financial situation, in the absence of any evidence to reflect actual payments under 
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, is sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. 
(See AG & 2(a)(1).)   
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating:43 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
