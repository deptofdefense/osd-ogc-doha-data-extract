TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-Qip) on September 20, 2007. On May 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F (financial considerations) for Applicant. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.

 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 5, 2009, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. DOHA received Applicant’s answer on June 9, 2009. 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 28, 2009, and I received the 
case assignment on August 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 12, 
2009, scheduling the hearing for September 15, 2009. The hearing was held as 
scheduled. 
 
The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were 
received without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which 
were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. I held the record 
open until September 25, 2009 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit 
additional material. The Applicant timely submitted AE C through F, which were 
forwarded by Department Counsel on October 19, 2009, without objection. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 24, 2000. The record closed on 
October 19, 2009. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions 
with explanations are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the 
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old limousine driver, who has worked for a limousine 
service in a major metropolitan area since October 2006. GE 1, AE B, Tr. 17. In August 
2007, he applied for a job with a defense contractor as a linguist and cultural advisor. 
The scope of this prospective job includes deploying to the Mideast in support of U.S. 
troops. This position also requires that Applicant successfully vet for a security 
clearance before he can begin employment. Tr. 62-65. 
 
Applicant was born in Pakistan, where he was educated and spent his formative 
years. He graduated from a Pakistani high school in March 1973, which is his highest 
level of education. Tr. 17, 59. He speaks Pashto, Urdu, and English. Tr. 63. Applicant 
immigrated to the United States. in November 1980. Tr. 58. He became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen in December 1990.1 Applicant was previously married to a U.S. citizen from 
February 1983 to August 1992. That marriage ended by divorce. He remarried in May 
1993 to his present wife, who like him, was born in Pakistan. She became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen in September 2001. GE 1. Applicant and his wife have four children, a 16-
year-old daughter, a 14-year-old son, a 12-year-old son, and an 8-year-old son. GE 1, 
Tr. 18-19. 
 
Applicant’s background investigation addressed his financial situation and 
included the review of his September 2007 e-QIP, his October 2008 and December 
2008 Responses to Interrogatories, his October 2007 and October 2008 credit bureau 
1 The transcript reflects that Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 1980. 
However, his e-QIP states he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 1990. This discrepancy is 
not significant to these proceedings.

reports, his state record of judgment filed in August 2005, and records from his state 
lottery commission. GE 1 – 7. 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed four separate debts consisting of a judgment of $12,255 
(personal loan), a past due debt of $613 (insurance premium), a collection account of 
$68,501 (state lottery commission), and a collection account of $828 (utility), totaling 
$82,197. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. – 1.d.) 
 
These debts were incurred during the time frame of May 1995 to May 20062 
when Applicant owned a small neighborhood grocery store in a major metropolitan area. 
As a result of the downturn in the economy, Applicant’s store failed and he was forced 
to close his store. The debts alleged remain. GE 1, Tr. 10. The four debts are 
summarized below. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a. is a $12,255 judgment Applicant owes to a video game vendor. The 
vendor originally loaned Applicant $10,000 in “about 2004.” When Applicant was unable 
to repay the loan to the vendor, the vendor filed suit in August 2004, and according to 
Applicant obtained a judgment against him in “2005.” Applicant testified he closed his 
store in 2005. The $12,255 judgment amount represents interest and penalties. 
Applicant has not paid or resolved this debt. GE 6, Tr. 20-26. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b. is a $613 collection account owed to an automobile insurance 
company for an automobile owned by Applicant that was repossessed in 2005. This 
account went into collection in September 2007. Applicant had not made paid or 
resolved this debt. GE 5, Tr. 26-31. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c. is a $68,501 collection account owed to the state lottery commission 
that supplied him lottery tickets at his store. Applicant testified that he was current with 
his state lottery ticket account until he experienced four robberies in “December (2004) 
to January (2005)” with the last robbery occurring on January 16, 2005. When queried 
by Department Counsel whether the amount owed was from losses sustained from the 
four robberies, Applicant responded, “Yes, and four robberies and plus my loss, what I 
lost in the store, you know. I use (sic) the money to cover up here and there.” Source 
documents from the state lottery commission indicate that as of July 27, 2009, 
Applicant’s debt to the lottery commission was $89,380.84 as a result of collection fees 
and interest. The same source documents indicate that Applicant was late in paying the 
lottery commission on April 5, 2002 ($6,195.69); September 20, 2002 ($5,749.22); 
September 2, 2002 ($5,037.12); May 30, 2003 ($6,705.42); June 27,2003 ($6,554.53); 
August 1, 2003 ($6,672.610; April 2, 2004 ($4,320.69); July 16, 2004 ($6,895.89); 
November 29, 2004 ($10,867.42) (just before string of robberies began); December 24, 
2004 ($10,966.07); January 14, 2005 ($10,265.51); January 21, 2005 ($6,770.25); 
January 28, 2005 ($8,893.76); February 4, 2005 ($8,930.00); February 11, 2005 
($8,225.00); and February 18, 2005 ($28,200.00). GE 2, GE 7.  Tr. 32-44. 
 
2 These dates are derived from Applicant’s September 2007 e-QIP, p. 13.

Department Counsel made the point that Applicant’s problems of falling behind 
with the state lottery commission were not limited to the string of robberies in December 
2004 and January 2005. The following is Applicant’s verbatim explanation and response 
to Department Counsel as reflected in the transcript: 
 
I believe the business had a problem, but that’s the way (of) the business. 
It’s like – it’s absolutely the business was had a problem and not doing 
well. So, you know, I was here and there, put it here, put it there. And then 
I was doing this to try to (do) what I can do to run the business. When you 
see that things is getting out of my hand, it’s started getting worse and 
ended up here. The robbery, things happened to me. And I says it’s 
getting worse and worse and then I have to shut it down, the business. 
That’s the only thing to happen. This is you know, I’m just give you, asking 
for one minute, please. This is job I apply just because I worry about my 
lot of money. It’s not going to be gone on me until I’m out of debt. Let me 
tell you this way. I want to pay this money. I’m honestly telling you I want 
to pay this money. That’s why I apply for this job. If I got this job, in one 
year, I work for one year and you’re going to see the difference in one 
year how much I pay them back. I have a lawyer. My lawyer is still talking 
to them. If you see my lawyer, he was talking to them and he will come to 
the agreement with a lot of company to pay them up. I back up because I 
don’t have any money to pay them. If you see a couple of cases have 
been solved here. Maybe because they’re dealing with a client who can’t 
pay the money so they kept the money, kept down the interest. Even my 
lawyer, you can call him, I was serious to pay this money to them, but my 
hand and my money was so tied and I have four kids to support them, to 
feed them. That’s most important than anything else for me. And that’s the 
way I put on the – I applied for this job only for one reason. I’m going to be 
out from my family, I’m going to be out from kids, I’m going to be out of my 
enjoyment, everything, to go there and suffer this country and make some 
money to pay these people off. This is the only my goal is. You ask me 
200, 300, 500 questions, I can answer you everything. But my business 
was lost. I was lost. I was picking up the money here, put it here over 
there, but I did not file my bankruptcy because I was very serious to pay 
the lottery company. That’s the most, most important to pay for me. This is 
federal money. I know this is not going to go away until I pay them off. But 
the main thing is this. I’m making only money to feed my family. This job 
provide me with money. I can sit with a lot of company, my lawyer talk to 
them and pay them off slowly, slowly, which is the best way to do this, 
handle these things. Tr. 44-47. 
 
Applicant has not paid or resolved this debt. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d. is an $828 collection account from a utility company owed on his 
store. Applicant testified that the utility company placed his account in collections when 
 
5 
 
 
he moved in 2007 and they did not have his current address. Applicant has not paid or 
resolved this debt. GE 4, Tr. 31-32. 
 
Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
investigator on December 5, 2007. He indicated that he had encountered business 
problems at his former grocery store and closed the business in 2005. He also indicated 
that he had contacted the vendor who had secured a judgment against him in 2007 and 
had agreed to repay him by monthly payments. Additionally, he informed the 
investigator that he would satisfy the debt to the insurance company within a week. GE 
2. 
 
Applicant was again interviewed by an OPM investigator on January 10, 2008 
regarding the collection account owed to the state lottery commission. Applicant 
explained at that time he was a victim of armed robbery at his grocery store in January 
2004 and suffered a casualty loss of approximately $60,000. This, according to 
Applicant, represents the net value of the lottery tickets which were purchased on credit 
from the state lottery commission. Applicant claimed that the state lottery commission 
“cleared him of all past debts due to the aforementioned casualty loss and subsequent 
closure of his corporate business.” GE 2. Applicant submitted three business cards from 
police detectives, who purportedly were assigned to investigate this robbery. AE E. He 
did not submit any copies of police reports or correspondence with the state lottery 
commission. The state lottery commission maintains the Applicant still owes the debt as 
alleged in the SOR plus interest and penalties. GE 7. 
 
In Applicant’s December 9, 2008 Response to Interrogatories, he submitted a 
letter dated December 4, 2008 from a law firm, which indicates the firm has been 
retained to represent him on the judgment to the vendor, the collection account to the 
insurance company, and the collection account to the utility company. The letter further 
indicates that Applicant earns $800 per week, and based on his salary and support 
obligations to his family, is unable to settle his past due accounts. However, if he were 
employed as a translator, “his income would be adequate to resolve these matters.” GE 
3. Applicant did not submit any evidence that he has paid, settled or otherwise resolved 
any of the debts alleged.  
 
Applicant submitted a letter dated September 9, 2009 from the same law firm 
indicating the firm also represents him on the debt owed to the state lottery commission 
as well as the other three creditors, discussed supra. AE A. Applicant submitted another 
letter dated September 24, 2009 from the same law firm stating again that the firm 
represented him on the judgment owed to the vendor. AE F. 
 
Applicant earns $800 per week as a limousine driver plus tips. His monthly rent is 
$1,500, his gas and electric bills are each $90 per month; his internet and cable is $100 
per month; and his cell phone is $100 to $130 per month. He has undisclosed food 
costs. He does not have a car payment, and his children go to public school. Tr. 52-54. 
Applicant’s wife is unable to work because she has cancer. She does have good health 
 
6 
 
 
insurance, which only requires a $3 co-pay for medicine and a $5 co-pay for doctor 
appointments. Tr. 54-55. 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant submitted an undated letter from the general manager of his limousine 
service employer that he has been working as a driver for them since October 2006, 
and that he makes $800 per week. Furthermore, the general manager stated that 
Applicant has always been punctual, hard working, and very professional. AE B. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
 
7 
 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” The Appeal Board has noted, “Applicant’s 
credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that 
Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” ISCR Case 
No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is 
documented in his credit reports, his OPM interview, his responses to DOHA 
interrogatories, his SOR response, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to 
ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying 
 
8 
 
 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating 
conditions is required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he did 
not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He did not resolve all of his delinquent 
SOR debts through payment, established payment plans or disputes.   
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part. Applicant did experience a business downturn; 
however, his promise to resolve these debts at his hearing rings hollow given his 
promises to repay in the past and his past assertion that he was making payments. 
Applicant submitted no evidence that he has contacted creditors or has attempted to 
otherwise resolve these debts. Several letters from a law firm advising they had been 
retained to handle these matters is insufficient. Applicant’s medical coverage is 
comprehensive and appears to cover medical costs associated with his wife’s cancer 
treatment except for modest co-pays.  
 
The Appeal Board’s discussion of AG ¶ 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an 
Applicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after 
 
9 
 
 
                                                          
circumstances outside an applicant’s control cause delinquent debt. In ISCR Case No. 
08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had a judgment against him in June 2001 
for $7,948; an IRS tax lien in January 2001 for $25,441 from tax years 1993 to 1997 
(since released), and a state tax lien in September 1999 for $6,701 (since released). 
These three delinquent debts established a history of financial problems, which included 
significant tax problems extending over eight years (1993 to 2001). Id. at 2. In 2007, the 
applicant’s business faltered (the circumstance beyond his control), and he generated 
about $21,000 in additional delinquent debt. Id. at 3-4. He paid six of his new debts, and 
three debts totaling about $17,000 remain for resolution. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2 
(App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). He obtained financial counseling, developed a repayment 
plan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment plan. Id. at 3. The Appeal 
Board at 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, 
 
.  .  .  what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the 
circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial 
condition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not “responsible” in 
light of his limited circumstances.    
 
Applicant’s unfulfilled promises to repay debts with no subsequent action offer little 
reassurance of future repayment. He asserts if he is given a security clearance, he will 
be able to get a job as a translator and cultural advisor and earn a salary that will allow 
him to repay his creditors. Unfortunately, this option is not available. Furthermore, it is 
unclear what the state lottery commission’s position is with respect to the armed robbery 
of Applicant’s store and reported loss of lottery tickets during that robbery. What is 
certain is the state lottery commission continues to pursue money owed to them, 
robbery notwithstanding.  
 
 Applicant offered no evidence that he has made any payments to any creditors. 
There is no evidence that he has contacted any of his creditors. In short, there is no 
evidence the Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are no 
clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved or is under control. He has 
not established financial responsibility.  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c), (d), and (e) do not apply. Applicant has not sought counseling nor 
has he indicated that he has a good-faith3 basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-due 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition]. 
 
10 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
debts. He did not establish good faith in the resolution of his SOR debts because he did 
not adequately demonstrate his efforts to pay any of his debts after he closed his 
business in 2005. He did not show sufficient adherence to his obligations. Applicant has 
never disputed the legitimacy of the debts alleged. 
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His debts resulted from a failed business, with 
the added undetermined losses following several robberies. Applicant’s debts have 
been owed since his business failed in 2005 with no sign of being resolved in the near 
future. I am not confident he will repay his delinquent debts because of his insufficient 
track record of financial progress over the last five years.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
    
  I note Applicant is gainfully employed as a limousine driver and is supporting a 
wife and four children. Apart from the SOR debts, he appears current on his day-to-day 
expenses. The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
significant. Applicant’s failure to pay or resolve his just debts over the past five years 
was not prudent or responsible. He has a history of financial problems. His debts are 
significant and ongoing.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
In short, Applicant has not demonstrated a meaningful track record of repayment 
or a good-faith effort to resolve these debts. While Applicant’s circumstances deserve 
consideration, the record is void of any affirmative action on his part to mitigate these 
debts.  
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors,”4 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. I conclude 
he has not shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate the financial 
considerations security concerns. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible 
for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
