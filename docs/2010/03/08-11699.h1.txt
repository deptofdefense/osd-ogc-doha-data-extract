HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant owed four debts, three of which had been placed for collection, totaling 
approximately $43,500. He has accepted settlement offers and made payment on two 
of the debts. Applicant failed to address the remaining debt, totaling approximately 
$16,700. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government’s security concerns 
under financial considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his 
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order 
and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
 
1 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 10, 2009, detailing security concerns under 
financial considerations. 
  
 On August 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On 
October 13, 2009, I was assigned the case. On November 5, 2009, DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on November 18, 2009. 
Applicant waived the 15-day notice rule. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 
through 6, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and 
submitted Ex. A through U, which were admitted into evidence.  
 
The record was held open to accept additional information from Applicant. On 
November 25, 2009, additional material was submitted. Department Counsel had no 
objection to the material, which was admitted into the record as Exs. V, W, and X. On 
December 18, 2009, additional material was submitted. Department Counsel had no 
objection to the material, which was admitted into the record as Exs. Y and Z. On 
November 30, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.d and 1.e of the SOR. He admitted the factual allegations, with explanations, in ¶ 1.c 
of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. 
After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 33-year-old WEB application developer who has worked for a 
defense contractor since August 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. 
Coworkers, supervisors, and acquaintances state Applicant is reliable, dependable, 
trustworthy, honest, ambitious, hard-working, conscientious, punctual, and professional. 
He has integrity, a strong work ethic, and finishes his products on time or early. (Ex. E 
through N, Tr. 37, 42) Applicant’s November 2009 work evaluation rates him as “very 
good” to “excellent” indicating his duty performance has been above average to far 
exceeding standards. (Ex. T)  
 
Applicant is married and has two children ages three and six. (Tr. 67) His wife 
recently obtained a three-month job paying $1,800 per month to help pay for his $3,800 
attorney fees related to his security clearance. (Tr. 67, 75, 93) His wife worked until 
2006, when their second child was born and the $1,200 monthly day care cost would 
have made it counterproductive for her to continue working. (Tr. 75, 102) When working, 
she was an accountant with an annual salary of $30,000. (Tr. 75) His annual salary at 
his current job is $74,000. (Tr. 74)  
 
 Applicant graduated high school with honors ranking 13th in his class of 290 
students. (Ex. O) Applicant worked full time while going to school full time. In the spring 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
 
2 
of 2000, he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and was a 
member of a national honor society. (Ex. O, Tr. 72) He has been steadily employed 
since 1997. (Tr. 74)  
 
 In September 2002, Applicant purchased a 2003 Mitsubishi automobile for 
approximately $41,0002 for his sister who was an administrative assistant at an 
engineering company. (Ex. 2, p. I9, Tr. 105) In November 2003, criminal charges were 
brought against his mother and sister when Applicant’s niece cut her chin and 
emergency treatment was not sought. (Ex. V, Tr. 76) Both were briefly incarcerated. (Tr. 
115) His sister was charged with failing to provide medical attention to a child younger 
than 15 years of age which recklessly caused bodily injury by omission, a felony. (Ex. V) 
Applicant provided $2,700 for his mother’s attorney fees. (Tr. 77) Applicant gives his 
mother $150 per month for her support. (Tr. 78)  
 
 In 2004, Applicant purchased a 2004 Ford Ranger pick-up truck for $13,000 and 
a Ford Expedition, SUV, for $27,000. (Tr. 83) Applicant’s annual salary was $48,000 
and the two cars cost $40,000. His wife’s annual salary added another $30,000. (Tr. 58, 
114) In 2004, the payments on his vehicles became delinquent, but the creditor agreed 
to add the delinquent payments to the end of the loan period, which extended the 
repayment period to July 2009. (Tr. 84) Applicant has recently paid for his vehicles, on 
which he had been paying $700 monthly. (Tr. 68)  
 
 In June 2004, the Mitsubishi was repossessed when his sister failed to make the 
$570 monthly payments because she was out of work for six weeks and also had to pay 
for her attorney. (Tr. 79) The car was sold and a balance of $11,000 remained to be 
paid. (Ex. 6) Applicant told the lender he would be liable for the debt and made two 
$300 payments on the debt. (Tr. 79) When the $300 payments caused his inability to 
make his other monthly payments, he stopped. (Ex. 2, p. I6). Five years later, a 
collection agency (SOR ¶ 1.a) was attempting to collect the debt, which had now grown 
to $20,550. In September 2004, Applicant sought legal advice concerning this debt and 
was advised to file bankruptcy. He was told by legal counsel not to make additional 
payments on his debts anticipating his bankruptcy filing.  
 
 In November 2004, Applicant received a substantial pay increase and was 
informed he no longer qualified for bankruptcy protection. (Ex. 2, p. I7) His annual salary 
was $65,000 at his new job and his wife’s annual pay remained at $30,000 for a 
combined annual salary of $95,000. (Tr. 58, 74, 119) In January 2005, Applicant 
attempted to set up a repayment plan. (Tr. 82) Between 2005 and 2007, Applicant was 
able to pay his bills in a timely manner, except for the debts listed in the SOR. In 
October 2009, Applicant informed the creditor (SOR ¶ 1.c) he was willing to pay $2,840 
on the $6,235 credit card debt. (Ex. C) In November 2009, the creditor made a counter 
offer to settle the debt for $3,000, which Applicant accepted and paid. (Ex. W) 
 
                                                          
2 The total cost of the car was $40,966, which included approximately $14,000 in finance charges. (Tr. 2, 
p. I9) 
 
3 
 In August 2007, Applicant received $24,286 from the sale of his home. (Ex. 2, p. I 
13) He had anticipated using the money to pay his debts. However, he had to make an 
$18,000 down payment on a new home. (Ex. 2, p. I7) Applicant was able to pay off two 
debts not listed in the SOR, one for $4,200 and the other for $2,000. (Ex. 2, p. l I18 and 
I19) The house was sold for $161,000 and the new home purchased for $189,000. (Tr. 
87) The new home was in a better area and better school district. (Tr. 87) In 2008, 
Applicant purchased furniture for $5,000 for the new house. (Tr. 92) He currently owes 
$1,400 on the account. (Tr. 93)  
  
 Applicant denied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b and admitted the debts in SOR ¶ 1.d and 
SOR ¶ 1.e. (Answer to SOR) Applicant owed a credit card company $19,237 (SOR ¶ 
1.b). The account was sold from one collection agency to another. Applicant asserts this 
debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) is a duplicate debt. The debt was transferred to the collection agency 
attempting to collect two credit card debts placed for collection: $10,116 (SOR ¶ 1.d) 
MasterCard account and $6,606 (SOR ¶ 1.e) VISA account. (Answer to SOR, Tr. 61) 
When Applicant contacted the agency, they wanted Applicant to commit to a payment 
he could not pay. He asserts they offered to settle for 50 per cent of the debt. In August 
2008, when Applicant completed a Questionnaire of Sensitive Positions, Standard Form 
(SF) 86, in response to question 28b, he indicated he owed $9,721 and $6,341 on these 
two debts. (Ex. 1, p 9, Tr. 112)  
 
 In August 2009, Applicant contacted the creditor by letter and requested 
verification of the debt. (Ex. R) At the hearing, Applicant stated he was going to pay the 
creditor. (Tr. 126) No evidence of payment has been received. In October 2008, 
Applicant stated he wanted to pay the SOR debts. At the hearing he again stated he 
wanted to pay the SOR debts. (Tr. 100, 126) Following the hearing, Applicant’s counsel 
indicated the debt no longer appears on Applicant’s CBR. There is no indication 
Applicant now intends to satisfy this past due obligation. 
 
 Applicant owed a credit card company $6,235 (SOR ¶ 1.c), which the company 
offered to settle for 60 percent of the balance. In October 2009, Applicant sent the 
creditor a letter offering to pay $1,560 on the debt. (Ex. C) In November 2009, the 
creditor made a counter offer to settle the debt for $1,870, which Applicant accepted 
and paid. (Ex. X) 
 
 In October 2008, when Applicant was first interviewed about his financial 
problems, he discussed the four SOR debts, which he admitted owing. He stated he 
wanted to repay the debts, but the collection agencies wanted only large lump-sum 
payments, which he could not afford. (Ex. 3) 
 
 In March 2009, Applicant responded to written interrogatories. (Ex. 2) At that time 
his monthly income was $4,863, his monthly expenses $1,348, his monthly debt 
payment approximately $3,000, and his monthly net remainder was $555. (Ex. 2, p I4) 
At the hearing, Applicant’s net remainder was $800. (Ex. P) His net worth was $33,000. 
(Ex. P)

 In September 2009, Applicant contacted and received financial counseling from a 
consumer credit counseling service. (Ex. B) Applicant is current on his mortgage, 
student loan, and ten additional accounts not listed in the SOR. (Ex. S)  
 
 Applicant’s September 2009 credit bureau report (CBR) lists two negative 
accounts. (Ex. A) Those are the debts listed in SOR ¶ 1.a and SOR ¶ 1.c, which 
Applicant has paid by mean of a $5,000 loan. (Tr. 62, 100) Recently, Applicant paid off 
two accounts and one loan not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 91-92)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered 
in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
 
5 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns 
relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 The record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial 
problems starting in 2004 or 2005. Applicant owed approximately $43,500 on four past 
due obligations owed to three3 creditors. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability 
or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a) – (e) are 
potentially applicable: 
                                                          
3 Applicant’s September 2008 CBR (Ex. 6, p. 12) clearly indicates the collection agency listed in SOR ¶ 
1.d and e. was collecting for the creditor listed in SOR ¶ 1.b. These are the same debts and I find for 
Applicant as to SOR ¶ 1.b. as a duplication of the other two debts.  
 
6 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; or 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s financial problems started in 2004 when his sister and mother were 
incarcerated. He provided his mother approximately $3,000 in attorney fees. In addition, 
the vehicle he had purchased, on which his sister was paying, was repossessed when 
she was out of work for six weeks and unable to continue the payments. Although 
Applicant and his wife’s joint annual salary was $78,000, he was unable to pay his debts 
as agreed and make the $570 monthly car payment. All his creditors, except for the 
three creditors listed in the SOR, worked with Applicant to arrange repayment of the 
debts. Following the hearing, Applicant paid two the SOR creditors. There is no 
evidence he has paid the remaining creditor or established a repayment plan with that 
creditor.  
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence because he had two large delinquent debts from 
November 2008 until December 2009. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant 
does not receive credit under AG ¶ 20(a). Two of the creditors were not paid until after 
the hearing and one creditor remains unpaid. The debts are a VISA account, a 
MasterCard account, a credit card account, and vehicle loan, which are common debts. 
The debts were not incurred under unusual circumstances. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
AG & 20(b) partially applies. Applicant experienced an unexpected $3,000 debt 
when his mother needed funds to pay her attorney and his sister stopped making the 
car payments. These are factors beyond Applicant’s control for which he deserves 
some mitigation. However, these events occurred in 2004. Until 2006, Applicant’s 
 
7 
household annual salary was between $78,000 and $95,000. It has been more than five 
years since the events. Additionally, it is not unexpected that someone who purchases a 
car for another will be required to make payment on the vehicle if the other person stops 
paying. AG & 20(b) has limited application.  
 
AG & 20(c) also has limited application. Applicant has received counseling and 
recently obtained a loan to pay two of the three SOR creditors. Except for the SOR 
debts, Applicant paid his other obligations in a timely manner. AG & 20(c) does not fully 
apply because Applicant has not addressed the $16,700 VISA and MasterCard debts 
listed in SOR & 1.d and 1.e.  
 
AG & 20(d) applies to the debts in SOR & 1.a and 1.c because Applicant 
obtained a loan and paid them. As previously stated, the debt in SOR & 1.b is a 
duplication of other debt listed in the SOR. I find Applicant has mitigated these three 
debts.  
 
The remaining $16,700 debt remains unpaid. In October 2008, Applicant stated 
he wanted to pay the debt, which he restated at the hearing. However, no indication of 
payment or the establishment of a repayment plan has been received. Applicant’s 
counsel asserts this creditor does not appear on Applicant’s recent CBR. There are 
numerous reasons why a debt may or may not appear on a CBR. In this case, Applicant 
admitted owing the VISA and MasterCard debts. He listed them on his SF 86, he 
discussed them in his October 2008 interview, in his March 2009 interrogatory 
response, and at the hearing. He stated he wanted to pay the money. But the debts 
remain unpaid. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were credit card 
accounts placed for collection and the balance owed on a repossessed vehicle. 
Applicant’s household income was between $78,000 and $95,000 and the debts were 
 
8 
 
9 
not addressed. I find Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
Additionally, there is no clear indication that the remaining debt is being resolved. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. 
 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot 
or will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award 
of a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime 
occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to 
the evidence presented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not 
recommended. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security 
clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance 
with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligation, he may well demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not 
warranted.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a—1.c:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d and 1.e:   Against Applicant    
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
