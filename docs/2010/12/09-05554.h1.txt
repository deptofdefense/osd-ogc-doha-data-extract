GOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 25, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after September 1, 2006.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR on July 16, 2010, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 17, 2010. DOHA 
issued a notice of hearing on August 31, 2010, and the hearing was convened as 
scheduled on October 13, 2010. The Government offered Exhibit (GE) 1 through 10, 
 
2 
 
which were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered Exhibit (AE) A through O, 
which were admitted without objection, called one witness, and testified on his own 
behalf. Applicant’s Attorney also provided a trial brief, marked App. Ex. I. The record 
was left open until close of business October 20, 2010 for receipt of additional 
documentation. Applicant, through his attorney, submitted eight additional documents, 
marked P through W, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 21, 2010.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a.(1) through 1.a.(29). He denied 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of all of 
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his employer since 1997. Applicant’s gross annual income from his employment ranged 
from approximately $108,390 to $106,150 from 2006 to present. He is married and has 
four children, ages 11, 9, 7, and 4. (GE 1; AE J; AE K; AE L; AE M; Tr. 42-43, 65.) 
 
 Applicant’s wife has a real estate license and has attempted to earn money 
through investing in real estate. Applicant’s wife made the decisions on all of their 
property investments, but Applicant was a co-signer on all of their mortgages and jointly 
owned the properties. (Tr. 88-89, 95-96, 102, 107.) 
 
 In 1996, prior to Applicant’s marriage to his wife, he purchased a home (Property 
One) in state A for approximately $168,500. He financed the purchase with a down 
payment of approximately $28,852 and a loan for $146,447. This was his primary 
residence until 2001. In November 2001, Applicant made his first real estate investment 
purchase with his wife and purchased a 4-plex in state A (Property Two) for the 
purchase price of $642,000. It was financed through a $557,800 loan and $82,757 down 
payment obtained by refinancing the mortgage on his primary residence. In October 
2002, Applicant sold Property One in state A for approximately $324,900. He and his 
family continue to own Property Two and reside in one of the units. (AE F; AE G; Tr. 47-
48, 60-70, 93.) 
 
 In January 2004, Applicant and his wife purchased a second 4-plex in state A 
(Property Three) for $885,000. Applicant put approximately $229,069 down, which was 
obtained by refinancing Property Two. He financed $663,750. Property Three was sold 
in May 2005 for $1,192,000. Applicant and his wife made $350,000 from the sale. (AE 
F; Tr. 48-50, 66, 110.) 
 
 In February 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased a duplex in state A (Property 
Four) for $203,000. Applicant put approximately $48,191 down, which was obtained by 
again refinancing Property Two. He financed $162,400. This property was sold in 
August 2005 for $280,000. (AE F; Tr. 50-51.) 
 
 
3 
 
 In April and May of 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased three single family 
residential condominium properties located in state B. They purchased Property Five for 
$230,000; Property Six for $305,000; and Property Seven for $190,000. The loans for 
these three properties were for $207,000; $274,447; and $152,000, respectively. They 
put a total of $143,844 down on all three of these properties, which they got from again 
refinancing Property Two. Applicant’s wife was responsible for the investment decisions 
regarding these properties, although she never traveled to state B to see the properties. 
(AE F; AE I; Tr. 53-54, 72-73, 76, 126.) 
 
 In October 2005, he and his wife purchased three more properties, located in 
state C. They purchased two residential 4-plexes (Property Eight and Property Nine), 
and a commercial property (Property Ten). Properties Eight and Nine were purchased 
for $350,000, each. They put $33,437 down on Property Eight and $36,784 down on 
Property Nine. The money for the down payment came from the sale of Property Four. 
He reports he financed $315,000 on Property Eight and $315,000 on Property Nine 
(although these numbers do not appear to add up correctly with his down payments to 
reach the purchase price). Property Ten was purchased for $1,430,000. They made a 
down payment of $316,050, which was obtained from the sale of Property Three. (AE F; 
AE H; Tr. 54-55.) 
 
 By the end of 2005, Applicant owned one property in state A (Property Two), 
three properties in state B (Property Five, Property Six, and Property Seven), and three 
properties in state C (Property Eight, Property Nine and Property Ten). He testified that 
at that time, he had no credit card debt. (Tr. 55.) 
 
 In 2006, Applicant began experiencing financial problems with Properties Five 
through Ten. When Applicant and his wife purchased the properties, Applicant’s wife 
claims that all of the properties were rented and had rental income that would cover the 
mortgages. However, due to the loss of tenants and problems with the companies 
managing the properties for them, they began to have a negative cash flow every 
month. Applicant was forced to borrow again from his 401K pension plan and began 
using credit cards to make the monthly payments on these properties. He had 
previously borrowed from his 401K plan in 2004 and 2006 to help his wife acquire their 
real estate investments. In 2006, Applicant’s total loss was $229,000. Despite the 
financial problems Applicant was already experiencing in 2006, Applicant purchased 
Property Eleven in October 2006 for $360,000, with $43,200 down and a loan for 
$324,000. This property was purchased from a friend of Applicant’s wife. The friend lent 
Applicant’s wife the money for the down payment and Applicant “didn’t put a penny into 
that property.” Applicant permitted the purchase despite the large loss on their other 
properties because his wife insisted that she could “turn them around.” (AE F; AE J; AE 
K; Tr. 56-60, 93, 111-123, 125.) 
 
 In 2007, Applicant’s losses continued as he borrowed again from his 401K and 
continued to use credit cards to satisfy his debt. In 2007, he sustained losses of 
$215,000. However, he claimed at hearing that he was not late on any of his mortgage 
payments through 2007. (AE K; Tr. 79-80.) 
 
 
4 
 
 In 2008, Applicant and his wife realized they could not sustain the investment 
properties. They decided to attempt the sale of some of their investment properties. 
Appellant was able to successfully short-sell Property Five. The amount of the 
deficiency is unclear from the record. The rest of the properties did not sell and were 
foreclosed upon, with the exception of Property Two, which Appellant still owns. 
Applicant’s 2008 Federal Income Tax Return filing shows a loss of $12,917 in 2008. (AE 
L; Tr. 78-88, 124.) 
 
 On November 13, 2009, Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
Applicant listed total liabilities of $2,834,253.31. Of that sum, $1,592,749 was in 
unsecured nonpriority claims. As part of their bankruptcy, Applicant and his wife took an 
on-line class on how to manage their finances. Allegations 1.a.(1) through 1.a.(29) and 
1.e. were all included in the liabilities listed in the Chapter 7 and found in Applicant’s 
credit reports. The remaining liability of $1,241,504 is for the first and second mortgage 
on Property Two, which Applicant still owns. He reaffirmed his mortgages on Property 
Two in his bankruptcy. Applicant received a discharge of his liabilities on April 26, 2010. 
(GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 7; GE 8; GE 10; AE A; AE C; AE E; Tr. 45, 94, 97.)  
 
 Applicant’s debts listed in the SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., and 1.g. are for mortgages 
on the various properties which were foreclosed upon, prior to Applicant’s 2010 
discharge of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Applicant and his attorney contend that 
Applicant owes nothing further on the foreclosed properties. A credit report completed 
on July 9, 2010, shows that Applicant has a $0 balance on all of his mortgage accounts 
displayed in the report. This report includes zero balances for the debts owed to the 
creditor alleged in ¶¶ 1.b., 1.f., and 1.g. (AE A; AE B; AE O.) 
 
 Allegation ¶ 1.c., a mortgage debt alleged to be past due in the approximate 
amount of $17,212, and ¶ 1.d., a credit card debt in the approximate amount of $1,424, 
are not easily matched up to any entry in Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Never the 
less, these two debts that existed on the Applicant’s 2009 credit reports, were 
discharged along with the listed debts according to 11 U.S.C. 524(a).1 Additionally, he 
has disputed the debts with the creditors. (GE 3; GE 4; GE 6; AE A; AE O.) 
 
 As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had personal liability on approximately 
$11,197 worth of debt on an account he opened in 2005 that was not discharged in 
bankruptcy. He is current on this account and making payments of approximately $238 
per month. He also noted credit card debt of $1,925, $1,356, and $272 owed to three 
additional creditors. (GE 10; AE B; AE D; Tr. 45-46.) 
 
 Applicant’s schedule J of current expenditures of individual debtors in his 
Chapter 7 shows that at the time he filed bankruptcy, he had a monthly net income of 
$10,936.34. His average monthly expenses were listed at $12,560. He had a deficit of 
$1,623.66. However, he testified he has $1,000 left over after his monthly expenses are 
met. His post hearing exhibits reflect that their household current net income is $10,700 
per month and they have $9,142 worth of living expenses each month. The surplus of 
                                                          
1 11 U.S.C. 524(a); see also In re Beezely, 944 F.2d 1433, 1437 (9th Cir. 1993).

$1,548 is allocated to his 401K and 401K loan repayment. He has an average monthly 
checking account balance of $3,426 and monthly savings account balance of $21.23. In 
addition, his bankruptcy filing lists real property totaling $1,673,000; including $900,000, 
the value of Property Two. The other real property listed in the bankruptcy included 12 
undeveloped properties held “free and clear” totaling $108,000, although Applicant 
claimed this land was “worthless.” Applicant has not taken a vacation in six or seven 
years. He contends he has learned his lesson with respect to investments and has 
pledged to be wiser in future investments. He is currently investing 10% of his income 
into his 401K. (AE A; AE P; AE Q; AE R; AE S; AE T; AE U; AE V; AE W; Tr. 61-63, 85-
88, 103.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
 
6 
 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18, as 
follows:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-
income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 On a salary of approximately $108,390 to $106,150 a year, Applicant 
contractually obligated himself to pay over $2,000,000 in mortgages from 2004-2005. 
Applicant voluntarily entered into these business ventures hoping to make a profit by 
renting the units. When the rental payments for the properties failed to cover the full 
amount of the mortgages and maintenance fees in 2006, he found himself relying on his 
credit to maintain his investments. He then incurred a large amount of credit card debt. 
Yet, he still went forward with the purchase of Property Eleven in October 2006 for 
$360,000. From 2005 to the 2010 discharge of Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he 
demonstrated a history of not meeting his financial obligations, which he had an inability 
to satisfy. Further, he consistently spent beyond his means on his investments. The 
evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
  
 
7 
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s debts listed on the SOR were discharged April 26, 2010, through the 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant’s questionable financial decisions that led to the 
bankruptcy occurred over a number of years. Not enough time has passed since 
Applicant’s discharge of debt to ascertain whether he will be more careful in future 
investments. He continues to maintain ownership of Property Two, which was 
reaffirmed in bankruptcy. He owes approximately $1,241,504 on this property. It does 
not appear that he has the funds to maintain that property and meet his monthly 
expenses given his current income, should any problems with his current tenants arise. 
He has an average savings of $21.23 per month and has been unwilling or unable to 
use his other assets such as the undeveloped land to get money to pay his mortgage in 
the past. AG ¶20(a) is not applicable. 
 
 Applicant’s debt is not the result of a condition beyond his control, but instead 
resulted from a series of bad business ventures entered into voluntarily by the 
Applicant. When Applicant began experiencing financial difficulties, instead of mitigating 
his losses, he relied on credit cards and withdrawals from his 401K. He continued to 
invest in Property Eleven, despite the difficulties he was experiencing with the other 
properties. While Applicant contends that his financial problems were due to the failing 
economy, problems with management companies, and the inability to get tenants in the 
rental units, Applicant and his wife did not act diligently with respect to the properties. In 
fact, Applicant’s wife, who managed the investments, never even visited the three 
properties in state B. Their continued operation of the failing properties from 2006 to 
 
8 
 
2009, while continuing to accumulate delinquent debt was not reasonable. Further, 
Applicant’s decision to utilize his credit cards to support the properties, instead of 
tapping into other resources like the 12 undeveloped properties held by Applicant’s wife, 
is questionable. Applicant failed to take steps to minimize the debt in a timely or 
reasonable manner.2 AG ¶20(b) is not applicable. 
 
 Applicant has discharged the majority of his debt through his Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, with the exception of Property Two, which he reaffirmed. As part of the 
bankruptcy, Applicant completed on-line financial counseling. However, there are no 
indications that the Applicant’s financial problems are resolved or are under control. As 
previously noted, documentary evidence suggests that each month, Applicant has little 
liquid assets left over for emergencies or future problems with the rental units he still 
owns in Property Two. AG ¶20(c) is not applicable. 
 
 The Appeal Board has indicated that good-faith “requires a showing that a 
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to 
duty or obligation.” 3 Further, “an applicant must do more than merely show that he or 
she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit 
of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.”4 Applicant’s large debts, discharged 
through Chapter 7, combined with the fact that he is still engaged in a large financial 
investment in Property Two, the recency of his financial problems, and his questionable 
financial decisions outlined above, indicate that he has not made a showing of 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. AG ¶20(d) is 
not applicable. 
  
 Finally, Applicant has contested the two debts not listed on his Chapter 7 
bankruptcy with the creditors under 11 U.S.C 524(a). With respect to these two debts 
only AG ¶ 20(e) is mitigating, in part. However, the dispute over the debts in no way 
indicates that he acted responsibly with respect to his finances as a whole or that he 
demonstrated he will act responsibly in the future.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent 
                                                          
2 The Appeal Board has held “Even if an applicant gets into financial difficulties because of circumstances 
beyond the applicant’s control, the Judge must consider whether the Applicant dealt with his or her 
financial difficulties in a reasonable manner.” ISCR Case. No. 99-0012 (App. Bd. December 1, 1999).  
3 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 at 4 (App. Bd. October 12, 1999). 
4 ICSR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. April 20, 2004). 
 
9 
 
to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant made questionable financial choices that do not demonstrate the 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness needed to hold a security clearance. Not enough 
time has passed since his discharge of debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Further, Applicant 
failed to introduce any character evidence to support his trustworthiness. There are 
significant unresolved concerns about Applicant’s finances and judgment.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g.:   Against Applicant 
 
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
