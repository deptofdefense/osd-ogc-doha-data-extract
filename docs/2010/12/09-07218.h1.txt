HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists ten delinquent debts totaling 
$1,471,421. He failed to make sufficient progress resolving his SOR debts, and financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated at this time. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 13, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (Item 5). On 
August 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interests to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On September 1, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (Item 2) He 
requested a decision without a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated October 19, 2010, was provided to him on October 28, 2010. 
He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was 
assigned to me on December 27, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s September 1, 2010 response to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j.3 He said he was “looking into a debt consolidation program” for six 
of the seven debts. For the mortgage-related debt in SOR ¶ 1.f, he is seeking a loan 
modification. He denied responsibility for the mortgage debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 
1.i because the property was sold. His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is 41-year-old electrician employed by a government contractor.4 He 
attended community college from 1992 to 1994. He has never served in the military. He 
married in 1995. His children were born in 1996 and 2002.    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In Applicant’s April 20, 2010 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said 
his financial problems were caused by “death in the family, spouse’s unemployment and 
the recession.” (Item 8 at 3, Item 11 at 4) His spouse unsuccessfully attempted to sell 
real estate after she lost her job as a school teacher. Id. In August 2009, she returned to 
full-time employment as a school teacher. (Item 8) In Applicant’s February 1, 2010 
response to DOHA interrogatories, he also listed negative cash flow from rentals, 
including lack of a tenant and cost of renovation as causes of delinquent debt. (Item 9 at 
10)   
 
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 21, 2010, and Applicant’s receipt is dated October 
28, 2010. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit 
information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 Unless stated otherwise, the information in this paragraph is from Applicant’s SOR response. 
(Item 2) 
 
4 Unless stated otherwise, the information in this paragraph is from Applicant’s SF 86. (Item 5)

Applicant’s SOR listed ten debts totaling $1,471,421. As indicated previously in 
his SOR response and his February 2010 and April 2010 responses to interrogatories, 
Applicant admitted the seven debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j. (Items 2, 9, 11) 
For six of these seven debts (not 1.f), he was investigating a debt consolidation 
program. On March 24, 2010, Applicant and his spouse signed a debt consolidation 
agreement that provided for Applicant and his spouse to make an initial payment of 
$1,995. (Item 11) However, he did not provide evidence that he made the initial 
payment. After March 2010, he did not provide details of his investigative process or 
provide the status of this effort at debt consolidation.   
 
The six SOR debts Applicant said are part of the debt consolidation program are 
as follows: 1.a (collection credit card—$10,673); 1.b (collection debt—$12,974); 1.c 
(credit card collection debt—$14,656); 1.d (collection debt—$7,792); 1.h (collection 
debt—$11,327); and 1.j (credit card collection debt—$9,999). (Items 1, 2) 
 
Applicant’s other four debts relate to real estate mortgages. Those four debts are 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i. (Items 1, 2) The status of the four mortgage debts is as 
follows: 
 
1.e and 1.i—RESOLVED. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e is for a first mortgage account 
in the amount of $492,000, and his credit report indicated his account was past due in 
the amount of $58,192. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i is for a second mortgage account in the 
amount of $121,000, and his credit report did not indicate the amount this account was 
past due. The document releasing Applicant’s ownership of the property was issued on 
June 28, 2010. (Item 2) The documentation described the transaction as a short sale 
and specified that Applicant would not receive any payment from the transaction. (Item 
2) The file does not explain why Applicant fell so far behind on the two mortgage 
accounts;   
 
1.f—UNRESOLVED. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f is for a first mortgage account in the 
amount of $410,000, and his credit report indicated his account was past due for 120 
days or more. Applicant’s SOR response indicates he is in the process of a loan 
modification agreement; however, he did not provide any correspondence from the 
creditor. (Item 2); and   
 
1.g—RESOLVED. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g is for a first mortgage account in the 
amount of $381,000, and his credit report indicated his account was past due for 120 
days or more in the amount of $18,435. Applicant’s SOR response indicates he has a 
loan modification agreement. He provided an August 3, 2010 letter from the creditor 
indicating if he made $2,910 monthly payments starting September 1, 2010 for three 
months, the creditor would modify the mortgage payments, making them more 
affordable. (Item 2) He did not provide proof of any payments to the creditor.  
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) of February 2010 showed monthly 
net income of $10,353 (included $5,000 in rental income); monthly expenses of $1,225; 
monthly debt payments of $6,800 (three mortgages); and a net monthly remainder of 
$2,328. (Item 9 at 8) His assets included $70,000 in stocks and bonds, and savings of 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
$2,000. (Item 9)  There is no explanation about why some of Applicant’s assets were 
not used to pay his creditors, or why some of the net surplus of $2,328 was not used to 
address some of his delinquent debts.        
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview 
(PSI), his responses to DOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response. Applicant’s SOR 
lists ten delinquent debts totaling $1,471,421. Some of his debts have been delinquent 
for more than a year. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants partial application of AG ¶¶ 
20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).5 Although there is only limited evidence of financial counseling, 
he evidently learned some aspects of budgeting when he generated his PFS. He also 
learned about real estate financing, foreclosures, expenses, cash flow, and short sales 
through his involvement with his rental properties. He has a good understanding of the 
requirements to maintain a budget and pay his debts. He showed some good faith when 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

he admitted responsibility for his SOR debts. Applicant’s financial situation was 
damaged by insufficient income, his spouse’s unemployment, her underemployment in 
real estate sales, the death of a relative, negative cash flow from rentals, and the 
recession. However, Applicant’s financial circumstances have been stable since August 
2009, and his February 2010 PFS indicates he has a net monthly surplus after making 
mortgage payments and other expenses of $2,328. His PFS also lists $70,000 in stocks 
and bonds as an asset, and there is no explanation about why some of his assets or 
monthly surplus was not used to pay his SOR creditors.   
 
Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
The file lacks proof that he maintained contact with all of his creditors.6 After April 2010, 
there is no evidence of any payments to his SOR creditors. There is insufficient 
evidence that his financial problem is being resolved and is under control.  
 
I have credited Applicant with resolving the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.i 
because the mortgage companies have advised Applicant of a short sale resolution of 
his liability. I have also credited Applicant with resolving the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.g 
because the creditor has written Applicant and agreed to a payment plan, which will 
bring the debt to current status. There is no reason to believe Applicant will default on 
his agreement to bring the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g to current status. He has acted 
responsibly on these three debts.  
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the other seven SOR 
debts, which total $477,421. He did not provide sufficient evidence showing his 
implementation of the debt consolidation plan for the six debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.h, 
and 1.j. He did not provide sufficient information about the status and efforts to resolve  
the mortgage debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. Applicant is a 41-year-old electrician 
employed by a government contractor. He attended community college from 1992 to 
1994. He married in 1995 and his two children were born in 1996 and 2002. He is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He 
deserves some credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee 
of a contractor. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his 
employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. Applicant’s 
financial situation was damaged by insufficient income, his spouse’s unemployment, her 
underemployment in real estate sales, the death of a relative, negative cash flow from 
rental properties, and the recession. I give Applicant substantial credit for admitting 
responsibility for his SOR debts, and being honest about his financial plight. These 
factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Applicant’s SOR listed lists ten delinquent debts totaling 
$1,471,421. He utilized a short sale to avoid payment of two mortgages and reduced his 
delinquent debt load by $613,000 ($492,000 + $121,000 = $613,000). He may also 
have reduced his debt loan on a substantial amount of interest charged on the two 
mortgages. I have also credited him with bringing a mortgage of $381,000 to current 
status under the assumption that he will make the three payments of $2,910. Applicant 
and his spouse’s financial circumstances have been stable since August 2009, and their  
February 2010 PFS indicate they have a net monthly surplus after making mortgage 
payments and other expenses of $2,328. Their PFS also lists $70,000 in stocks and 
bonds as an asset, and there is no explanation why some of their assets or monthly 
surplus was not used to establish the debt consolidation plan in April 2010. There is no 
evidence that seven SOR creditors, who Applicant owes $471,421, have received any 
payments since April 2010. Applicant has failed to make sufficient progress resolving 
seven of his delinquent SOR debts.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
