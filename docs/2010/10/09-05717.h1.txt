Decision

MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 2010, in which she 
listed $52,584 in unsecured nonpriority claims, including an $8,500 timeshare debt and 
$9,466 for a leased truck that she surrendered voluntarily when she could no longer 
afford the payments. The case is pending and a discharge has not yet been granted by 
the bankruptcy court. She incurred debt after her then-fiancé was laid off in March 2007, 
but she also made some poor financial decisions that continue to cast doubt on her 
judgment. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On December 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that provided the basis for its preliminary 
decision to deny her eligibility for a security clearance, and to refer the matter to an 
administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
 
 
 
 2 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation 
5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (January 1987) as amended; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006. 
 
 On December 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested 
a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2009, to conduct a hearing and 
to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for a security clearance. With the agreement of the parties, on April 6, 2010, I 
scheduled a hearing for April 22, 2010. 
 
 I convened the hearing as scheduled. Five Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and six 
Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-F) were admitted into evidence without objection, and 
Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on May 3, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of 
December 2009, Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $50,826 (SOR 1.a-1.l), 
including $3,639 in unpaid federal income taxes for 2005 (SOR 1.l). Applicant admitted 
the debts except for the tax debt, which she indicated had been satisfied in 2009. She 
asserted that she had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had changed her spending 
habits. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
factual findings. 
 
 Applicant is a 55-year-old facility security officer who has worked for her present 
employer since October 2001. She seeks to retain her secret clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 28.) 
 
 Applicant started with her employer as an administrative assistant in its corporate 
headquarters. (Ex. 1.) Applicant owned a home purchased for $69,939 in June 1994. 
(Ex. 4, Tr. 36.) In August 2002, she refinanced her mortgage taking on a primary loan of 
$88,000 and a second mortgage of $21,000. (Ex. 4.) By 2004, she owed about $12,000 
in retail charge card debt. With her monthly payments becoming a burden, Applicant 
entered into a repayment plan with a debt consolidation firm around 2004. Over the next 
year, payments were made to settle her accounts, some for less than the full balance. 
(Ex. 4, Tr. 36-38.) 
 
In early 2005, Applicant and her then-fiancé moved to her current locale for her 
job. In March 2005, Applicant sold her previous residence for $230,000. (Tr. 35.) Using 
all but $10,000 of the equity, she bought a snowblower and paid off a jewelry debt and 
the $3,500 balance on her fiancé‟s truck. (Tr. 48.) She used the rest of the equity to put 
down 14% of the $169,000 purchase price for her present home in June 2005. She took 
out a mortgage of $150,000. (Ex. 4; Tr. 39-40, 48.) 
 
 
 3 
Applicant‟s fiancé began working in their new locale in April 2005, but his work 
was inconsistent and at wages that varied from $10 to $14 hourly, less than the $18 
hourly he had earned before they moved. (Ex. 2, E.) He worked until September 2005 
as a maintenance technician, from March 2006 to June 2006 as a plumber‟s assistant, 
and from October 2006 to March 2007 as an electrician‟s assistant. (Ex. E.) 
 
Applicant continued to spend with the expectation that her fiancé would continue 
to bring income into the household. (Tr. 31.) In March 2006, she financed a new 
motorcycle for $8,715 through a loan with $220 monthly payments. (Ex. 4, 5.) She also 
took out a home equity loan of $35,000 with monthly repayment at $261 per month. (Ex. 
4.) In June 2006, she took out a $4,985 loan for a 2003 model-year motorcycle. 
Applicant paid off this motorcycle in January 2007 with the home equity loan. (Tr. 50, 
57-58.) 
 
Around December 2006, Applicant sold a home that she had owned with three 
others before their deaths, and realized $11,000 from the sale. (Tr. 62-63.) She paid off 
a $11,040 loan for a 1998 model-year recreational trailer financed in September 2006. 
(Tr. 82-83.) 
 
In September 2006, Applicant traded in her car, which she owned outright, for a 
6-cylinder truck. Her monthly repayment for the truck was $308 on a $14,659 loan. (Ex. 
4, 5.) Less than six months later, she traded in that truck for an 8-cylinder truck, which 
she leased for three years (SOR 1.g). (Ex. 4, 5; Tr. 43, 86.) In March 2007, her fiancé 
was laid off. (Ex. E.) He collected unemployment compensation for ten weeks. (Tr. 41.) 
Applicant provided all the income for their household for the next year. (Tr. 48.) Just 
before her fiancé was laid off in March 2007, Applicant took a trip to a resort and she 
purchased a timeshare interest through a loan of $8,258 (SOR 1.i). (Ex. 3, 4.) She felt 
she could afford the $168 monthly payment. (Tr. 45.) In November 2007, although she 
still had the leased truck, she financed the purchase of a 2004 model-year SUV through 
a loan of $11,122, to be repaid at $224 per month. (Ex. 4, 5; Tr. 47-48, 82.) 
 
In 2007, Applicant was informed that she owed $1,088 on a $7,015 installment 
loan that she had taken out to install a furnace in her previous residence in 2005 (SOR 
1.f). She believed she had paid off the loan when she sold her house, but she was 
informed that she owed unpaid finance charges. She disputed the debt to no avail. (Ex. 
2, 4, 5.)  
 
In mid-September 2007, the IRS notified Applicant that she owed $3,639 in 
delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2005 because of debt that had been forgiven by 
her creditors (SOR 1.l). After filing amended returns, Applicant calculated her federal tax 
delinquency at $3,496 and her state tax delinquency at $443 for 2005. (Ex. 3.) Applicant 
repaid the IRS at $150 per month and the state at $50 per month. Her tax debts were 
satisfied in 2009. (Ex. B, C; Tr. 52.) 
 
Due to the unexpected tax payments, and with her fiancé still unemployed, 
Applicant began to have difficulty making her monthly payments on several credit card 
 
 4 
accounts that she had used for household expenses after her fiancé‟s layoff. She 
considered selling the 2003 model-year motorcycle that she owned outright, but her 
fiancé persuaded her not to sell it. (Tr. 58.) In December 2007, Applicant retained the 
services of a timeshare reseller at a fee of $399, but she had no success in selling her 
timeshare. (Ex. 3.) 
 
In May 2008, she entered into an agreement with a debt consolidation company 
to settle two delinquent credit card accounts delinquent since April 2008 (SOR 1.c and 
1.d), and a $7,000 debt to an investment firm. Under the agreement, Applicant was to 
pay $271 per month for three years to settle $17,075 of debt. She made the payments 
in May and June 2008. (Ex. 3.) In July 2008, Applicant and her fiancé terminated their 
relationship and he moved out. (Tr. 31.) She decided to file for bankruptcy on the advice 
of a consumer credit counseling agency (Tr. 27.), and she stopped paying for her 
timeshare and on some of her credit card accounts. In mid-July 2008, Applicant 
withdrew from the debt repayment plan in anticipation of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. 
(Ex. 3.) After making her monthly loan payments ($261 on the home equity loan, $220 
for her newer motorcycle, $1,377 for her mortgage, $224 for her car, $388 for her truck), 
her utilities, and her food, Applicant did not have the funds to file for bankruptcy (Tr. 
47.), even after selling a 14-foot boat for $2,000 in July 2008. (Ex. A, Tr. 56.) She did 
not consider selling her older motorcycle because she believes she would get only 
$3,000 for it, which would be “a drop in the bucket” based on her overall debt. (Tr. 60.) 
She listed the trailer for sale at $6,000 and was offered $3,000, which she considered 
too low, given she had paid $11,040 for it. (Tr. 61-62.) 
 
In 2008, Applicant borrowed a total of $8,000 from her 401(k) account, including 
$4,522 in August 2008, for home repairs, such as a new roof and a pellet stove. (Ex. A, 
Tr. 96-98.) In September 2008, she voluntarily surrendered her truck, terminating her 
lease early, because she could not afford the $388 monthly payments. She was held 
responsible for the $7,675 balance of the lease (SOR 1.g). (Ex. 4, 5.) In late 2008, she 
consulted with the first of several attorneys about bankruptcy. (Tr. 69.) 
 
On January 29, 2009, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). She disclosed that she owed four delinquent credit 
card debts (SOR 1.c,1.d, 1.e, 1.h) totaling $23,694.33 and $8,057.86 for the timeshare. 
She indicated that she was “working on a payoff plan.” (Ex. 1.) Applicant was 
interviewed about her delinquencies by a Government investigator on April 3, 2009. 
Applicant indicated that she began to fall behind after her former fiancé left, but the high 
cost of heating oil was a contributing factor as well. Applicant related that she had 
spoken to several attorneys about filing for bankruptcy and was in the process of 
retaining one. (Ex. 2.) 
 
On April 3, 2009, Applicant paid $598 to an agent in an effort to sell her 
timeshare. (Ex. 3.) As of April 2010, it had not sold. In June 2009, Applicant‟s current 
boyfriend moved in with her. (Tr. 93.) With his contribution of $650 per month to the 
household, Applicant had about $595.37 in discretionary funds each month. (Ex. 3.) Yet 
 
 5 
she told DOHA in September 2009 that she had not yet saved the funds to pay a 
bankruptcy attorney. (Ex. 3.)  
 
In December 2009, Applicant retained a lawyer for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Ex. 
F.) She paid his retainer and the filing fees at $500 in December 2009 and $900 in 
February 2010 with her income tax refund. (Tr. 34, 65.) On January 13, 2010, the 
creditor identified in SOR 1.g was awarded a judgment against her in the amount of 
$9,465. (Ex. A.) On February 26, 2010, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, 
listing $52,584 in unsecured nonpriority claims, including the consumer credit debts in 
the SOR (SOR 1.a to 1.k). Among her debts was a $2,600 balance owed to a local 
motorcycle shop from May 2008 that was not alleged in the SOR. She indicated her 
intent to reaffirm her primary mortgage and the loan for the 2006 motorcycle, and to 
continue to make her payments on the SUV financed in November 2007.  Applicant 
reported annual wages from her employment of $54,803 in 2008 and $59,280 in 2009, 
which was insufficient to cover all her expenses. She reported a net monthly deficit of 
$473 based on her income without any contribution from her boyfriend. (Ex. A.) 
 
In conjunction with her bankruptcy filing, Applicant completed online and 
telephone credit counseling on February 17, 2010. (Ex. A, Tr. 22.) As of her hearing on 
her security clearance eligibility, she had yet to take a course in personal financial 
management required for a bankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 66.) A meeting of her creditors 
was held on April 2, 2010. (Ex. A; Tr. 27-28.) It is unclear whether any creditors 
objected. The deadline for any objections to discharge was June 1, 2010. (Ex. A; Tr. 
29.)  
 
 Applicant has been current in her payments on her primary mortgage, which had 
a principal balance of $140,717 as of February 2010. (Ex. 4, A; Tr. 25.) She was also 
making her home equity loan payments on time (Tr. 26.), although it had been late as 
recently as the summer of 2008. That loan had a balance of $26,849 as of February 
2010. (Ex. 4, 5, A; Tr. 25.) Applicant continued to pay on the motorcycle and car loans. 
(Ex. 5; Tr. 57.) She wants to keep the motorcycle but is not sure whether she can 
continue the $220 monthly payments. (Tr. 57.) As of mid-April 2010, Applicant was 
repaying her 401(k) loan at $188 per month. (Ex. A; Tr. 98.) She has not used any credit 
cards since she bought Christmas gifts in December 2009. (Tr. 86-87.) She purchased 
a carpet cleaner on credit in the fall of 2009. (Tr. 92.) Applicant had about $10 in 
savings as of mid-April 2010, and was relying on her boyfriend paying her $650 per 
month to make ends meet. (Tr. 53-54, 92-94.) He has his own business, and during the 
winter of 2010, he did not always pay his share of the rent on time. (Tr. 94.) Applicant 
has been looking for a second housemate to share expenses. (Tr. 53.) Applicant 
understands the concerns about  her financial stability and she intends to stick to her 
budget. (Tr. 33.) 
 
Applicant has not allowed her personal financial problems to negatively affect her 
work performance. The Defense Security Service rated the overall security posture of 
Applicant‟s facility as commendable in 2007, 2008, 2009, and again in 2010. Applicant 
 
 6 
was found to be “very effective” in administering the National Industrial Security 
Program. (Ex. D.) 
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a 
security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative 
guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are 
required to be considered in evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified 
information. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge‟s overall arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
 The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that reasonable, logical, and based on 
the evidence of record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present 
evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, 
the Applicant is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, 
explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department 
Counsel. . . .” The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable 
security decision. 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be 
“in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern about finances is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 Applicant settled some retail credit card accounts for less than their full balances 
in 2005, and it led to her owing $3,496 in federal and $443 in state income taxes (SOR 
1.l). After she moved to her present locale, she continued to spend without regard to 
what she could reasonably afford. She took on debt of $13,700 for two motorcycles, 
$11,040 for a recreational trailer, and $8,258 for a timeshare between March 2006 and 
March 2007. She took out a home equity loan of $35,000, used in part to pay off the 
loan on the older motorcycle, but also to pay living expenses. In 2008, she could no 
longer make even her monthly minimum payments on her credit cards (SOR 1.a to 1.e, 
1.h, and 1.j), and she stopped paying on the timeshare loan (SOR 1.i). In September 
2008, she terminated her truck lease prematurely, and the lender eventually obtained a 
judgment against her in January 2010 (SOR 1.g). As of April 2010, Applicant was 
seeking a discharge in bankruptcy of $52,584 in delinquent unsecured debt, including 
the debts in SOR 1.a through 1.k. Potentially disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), 
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply. 
 
 Furthermore, Applicant‟s spending habits implicate AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent 
spending beyond one‟s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, 
significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.” 
Applicant was unable to file for bankruptcy before 2010 because she did not have the 
funds to do so. Applicant‟s expenses exceed her income by $473 each month, and she 
is meeting her living expenses only because of loans and contributions from her live-in 
boyfriend. The Government‟s case for application of AG ¶19(b), “indebtedness caused 
by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or 
intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt,” is less persuasive. If 
Applicant‟s debts are discharged in her no-asset bankruptcy, her creditors will not be 
paid. That said, Applicant does not have a history of spending without any intent to pay 
her debts. She struggled to make the monthly minimums on several accounts while her 
then-fiancé was unemployed until she could no longer do so, and with limited exception, 
has been current on her mortgage, home equity, 401(k), and vehicle loans.  
 
 
 8 
 AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably 
apply in mitigation, even in the event of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Her financial 
problems are extensive and too recent to favorably consider AG ¶ 20(a).  
 
AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person‟s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” applies in limited part. After some lenders 
forgave her debt in 2005, Applicant had to repay tax debt totaling $3,939 that she 
perhaps should have expected, but did not, when her former fiancé was out of work. 
Applicant had no control over the job prospects for her fiancé in their locale, and she 
was the sole supporter for the household for over one year after his unemployment ran 
out. In 2008, she incurred some home-repair expenses (e.g., roof) that could not 
reasonably be deferred. Yet, AG ¶ 20(b) does not mitigate her financially irresponsible 
decisions. Her fiancé was out of work from July 2006 until October 2006. Yet in 
September 2006, Applicant purchased a trailer for $11,040. In September 2006, she 
traded in her car, which she owned outright, for a 6-cylinder truck. Her monthly 
repayment for the truck was $308 on a $14,659 loan. Less than six months later, she 
traded in that truck for an 8-cylinder truck, which she leased for three years (SOR 1.g). 
Just before her fiancé was laid off in March 2007, Applicant took a trip to a resort and 
she purchased a timeshare interest through a loan of $8,258 (SOR 1.i). Assuming she 
did not know that her fiancé was going to be laid off, she certainly knew that he was not 
bringing much income into the household. Her decision to take on new debt for a 
timeshare was not reasonable. Then, in November 2007, after she had been notified by 
the IRS of her tax debt, she financed the purchase of her current vehicle, a 2004 model-
year SUV through a loan of $11,122, when she was already leasing a truck. 
 
 Applicant‟s satisfaction of her tax debts, including the debt in SOR 1.l, falls within 
AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.” Around March 2008, Applicant entered into a debt repayment 
plan to resolve about $17,075 of delinquent debt, including SOR 1.c and 1.d. She made 
two payments that reflect a good-faith intent to pay her creditors. But she did not follow 
through after her fiancé left, electing instead to file for bankruptcy. Assuming Applicant‟s 
unsecured debt is discharged in the bankruptcy, she will be relieved of a significant debt 
burden. But while bankruptcy is a legal remedy, it is not a substitute for a track record of 
repayment. Under a Chapter 7 discharge, it is likely that only the creditors holding debts 
reaffirmed by Applicant will be paid. AG ¶ 20(d) cannot be fully applied. 
 
 A bankruptcy discharge could implicate AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or 
is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” But Applicant had not yet completed 
personal financial counseling required for the bankruptcy. It would be premature to 
apply AG ¶ 20(c) without a discharge and a sustained showing by Applicant that she 
can live within her means. 
 
 9 
 AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue,” was not satisfied. While Applicant disputed the debt in SOR 1.f with the credit 
bureaus because she paid off the loan when she sold her previous residence, she 
subsequently learned that she satisfied the loan too late to avoid finance charges, which 
are unpaid. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct 
and all the relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed 
at AG ¶ 2(a).1 Applicant‟s finances were adversely affected by the lengthy 
unemployment of her fiancé. She incurred home-repair costs that could not be deferred. 
Yet, Applicant clearly lived beyond her means. And there is little expectation that she 
will regain financial stability in the near future, even if she is granted a bankruptcy 
discharge. She is unable to meet her present expenses on her income. Despite knowing 
that her financial problems could lead to the revocation of her clearance and loss of 
employment, she remains reluctant to part with her motorcycles. She rejected an offer 
of $3,000 for the trailer because it was too low, and she has had no success in selling 
her timeshare. As recently as the fall of 2009, Applicant was still relying on consumer 
credit cards for discretionary purchases like a carpet cleaner. She has not used any 
consumer credit cards since she bought gifts for the holidays in December 2009. She 
has also been responsible and reliable at work in implementing the policies and 
procedures for the protection of classified information within her facility. But concerns 
persist about whether Applicant can be counted on to make sound financial decisions 
going forward. I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue her access to classified information. 
                                            
1
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual‟s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.
