Decision 
______________ 
 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 24, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a Security Clearance 
Application (e-QIP).1 On August 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his financial situation. He 
responded to the interrogatories on September 1, 2009.2 On December 15, 2009, 
DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP), dated March 24, 2009.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated September 1, 2009).

modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access 
to Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 23, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, notarized on January 7, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on February 24, 2010, and 
the case was assigned me on March 9, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 
18, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on April 20, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits and six Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant and his wife testified. The record 
remained open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on April 27, 
2010, he submitted nine additional exhibits that were also admitted into evidence, 
without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 29, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations 
(¶¶ 1.a. through 1.p., and 1.r.) of the SOR. He denied the factual allegation in ¶ 1.q. of 
the SOR, and submitted two documents in support of his contention pertaining to that 
particular allegation. 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a maintenance trades helper,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He has 
no prior military service.4 A May 1997 high school graduate,5 with some vocational 
school and community college credits,6 he has worked in a variety of positions in a 
variety of locations in two different states. He was a maintenance worker for a local 
government from August 1998 until August 2005; a maintenance worker for a large 
national box store; a sorter; a trades crafts worker; a route driver; and a maintenance 
host, before being hired by his current employer.7 He also went through periods of

unemployment, sometimes as few as two months, and once as long as six months.8 He 
has been with his current employer since February 2009.9 
 
Applicant has been married since March 2001.10 It is unclear if he and his wife 
have any children. 
 
Character References 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor is supportive of Applicant and believes Applicant is “a 
proven entity” in his division, as well as very courteous in his daily interactions with the 
clients they serve.11 A very dear friend of Applicant’s mother for the past 19 years, who 
also happens to be Applicant’s landlady since his current employment, characterized 
him as dedicated and committed to his family, and willing to step into situations to help 
his mother and grandmother in times of stress.12 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2004. At some 
point prior to mid-2004, Applicant’s wife lost her job and was unemployed for about four 
months before obtaining another job with a salary that was 50 per cent less than her old 
salary.13 Later that fall, they were unable to continue making the $460 monthly lease 
payments on his automobile.14 The creditor filed an action against Applicant and 
obtained a garnishment of his wages, resulting in a $457 attachment of his wages every 
two weeks, or nearly twice the previous payment.15 With the assistance of an attorney 
costing him $1,600, Applicant was subsequently able to reverse the action, but the 
automobile was repossessed.16 The repossession necessitated the purchase or lease 
of another vehicle, adding to his indebtedness.17 With insufficient funds to pay the 
monthly payments, Applicant’s accounts fell deeper into delinquency. With his total 
liabilities reaching $36,694, and total assets of only $6,983, in November 2004, 
Applicant and his wife filed a voluntary joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of

consumer debt was 19
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems at that time to “immaturity to develop a 
budget,” some financial irresponsibility, and buying habits based on their anticipated 
continued joint income.20 
 
In August 2005, Applicant and his wife decided to relocate from one state to 
another solely with the expectations of finding better-paying positions in what was 
initially thought to be a more economically stable economy. They wanted to get away 
from dependent family members and paying rent, and relocate to start their own lives 
and income. Expectations were not initially met when they were unable to find good 
jobs. Instead, they found jobs that paid substantially lower than the ones they previously 
had, and hoped to get. Eventually, they both got better jobs: his wife was a nursing 
assistant and he was a painter.21 In March 2007, fate stepped in and, when his mother 
asked for help in caring for his suddenly-ill grandmother–with whom he was very close–
Applicant and his wife relocated back to the location of their old residence.22 Applicant 
initially could not find a job, but in July 2007, he found one in maintenance at a local 
hotel. His wife did not earn a salary for she was furnishing full-time healthcare for his 
grandmother.23 
 
Applicant’s mother lost her job (paying her $65,000 per year)24 in September 
2007, leaving him to support the entire extended family of five: grandmother, mother, 
nephew, Applicant’s wife, and himself.25 Applicant’s wife had to move again to retain 
her professional license, and his grandmother’s health had improved, so in August 
2008, Applicant joined his wife.26 Unfortunately for his wife, in mid-2008, she sustained 
an injury while at work, and three weeks later sustained another injury now requiring 
surgery.27 Although she received $270 workman’s compensation per week,28 Applicant 
was still unemployed, and that amount was simply insufficient to sustain them

financially.29 He started to fall behind in his monthly payments, and several accounts 
became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off.  
 
In August 2009, Applicant and his wife met with a financial counselor of the 
Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). A debt management program was 
tentatively prepared along with a budget,30 but it was the counselor’s opinion that 
Applicant could not sustain a repayment plan involving one monthly payment to be 
distributed among all of his creditors because he did not have sufficient funds to do 
so.31 Instead, it was determined that the best option would be to address several 
accounts at a time with standard payment arrangements, before moving on to the next 
set of accounts.32 That was the plan Applicant arranged and has follow 33
 
In addition to noting Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 17 
purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by two credit reports from 2009.34 
Some accounts have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or 
collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in 
many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor or 
collection agent name, or under a different creditor or collection agent name. Some 
accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified by 
partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others 
eliminating other digits. Those debts listed in the SOR, all of which Applicant 
acknowledged, and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, 
documents submitted by Applicant, and Applicant’s related written and testimonial 
comments, are described below:

Except for the accounts where payments have already been clearly made, 
Applicant’s repayment plan is merely a proposed plan generated by him, without 
acknowledgment or approval by the remaining creditors.67 Also, where proposed 
payment dates have already passed, unless I have received definitive proof of such 
payments, the record is silent.  
 
In addition to the SOR-related debts, Applicant has also been repaying several 
debts not listed in the SOR, and has either paid them off or at least brought them 
current.68 His wife has some delinquent debts in her name, but Applicant is not 
concerned with them at this time.69 
 
On September 1, 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement 
indicating monthly net income of $2,742, monthly expenses of $2,452, scheduled 
monthly debt payments of $71.75, and a net remainder of $189 available for

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”73 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”74   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”75 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.76  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”77 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”78 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” is potentially disqualifying. As 
noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about mid-
2004, when his wife lost her job and was unemployed for about four months before 
obtaining another job with a salary that was 50 per cent less than her old salary. Unable 
to maintain monthly payments, disputes arose with creditors and a repossession 
occurred. With insufficient funds to pay the monthly payments, Applicant’s accounts fell 
deeper into delinquency. With his total liabilities reaching $36,694, and total assets of 
only $6,983, in November 2004, Applicant and his wife filed a voluntary joint petition for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On February 22, 2005, an 
unspecified amount of consumer debt was discharged.  
 
Six months later, with a relatively clean financial slate, Applicant and his wife 
chose to relocate to another state based on the expectations of finding better-paying 
jobs. Expectations were not initially met. Family health issues arose and Applicant and 
his wife made several other moves to provide care for the various family members while 
permitting their finances to again deteriorate. Unfortunately for his wife, in mid-2008, 
she sustained an injury while at work, and three weeks later sustained another injury 
now requiring surgery. Although she received workman’s compensation,  Applicant was 
unemployed, and accounts again became delinquent and sent for collection, or were 
charged off. He made very little effort to contact his creditors to resolve his accounts 
until late 2009. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@79 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
79 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
 
12 
                                      
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2004, were resolved by Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge of his debts in 2005, and eventually re-emerged. Applicant 
attributed his pre-bankruptcy financial problems to “immaturity to develop a budget,” 
some financial irresponsibility, and buying habits based on their anticipated continued 
joint income; and his post-bankruptcy financial problems to family health issues and 
periodic unemployment by both his wife and himself.  
 
However, it appears that while these circumstances may have contributed to his 
financial problems, they do not appear to be the primary cause. Quitting gainful 
employment in search of the possibility of better employment in another state, bouncing 
back and forth between states and jobs, generating unemployment, and ignoring the 
timely handling of his bills, while still spending money, actually caused his financial 
meltdown. Because the financial situation is frequent and continuing in nature, he 
receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(a). Applicant’s handling of his finances, under 
the circumstances, casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
 
Likewise, he receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while the conditions 
that contributed to the financial problem at some point were initially beyond Applicant’s 
control (e.g., loss of his employment, his grandmother’s health, his mother’s 
unemployment, and his wife’s unexpected medical problems), Applicant failed to act 
responsibly under the circumstances. Rather than consolidating and minimizing 
expenses, he seemingly continued to spend unwisely, relocating state to state, and 
giving up employment for a job elsewhere. He increased his expenditures, ignored his 
debts, and failed to reduce his delinquencies.80  
 
AG & 20(c) applies because Applicant has received financial counseling and debt 
consolidation guidance from a CCCS credit counselor in August 2009. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to 
start repaying only 3 of the 17 creditors before the hearing, but after the SOR was 
 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

issued. With the exception of those three creditors and the few additional ones to whom 
he started making payments after the hearing, Applicant never contacted any of the 
creditors to try to make repayment arrangements. Instead, he simply prepared his 
proposed repayment plan with anticipated payments, but no indication that those 
creditors had agreed with his plan or that additional payments had, in fact, been made. 
Over the years, Applicant did not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his 
remaining delinquent debts. Instead, he ignored his debts until his security clearance 
review commenced. Applicant has been down this path in the past, and while there is 
some positive action, since 2005, when his Chapter 7 bankruptcy was discharged, it 
appears he has taken little significant actions to address the satisfaction of his 
delinquent debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant he has not provided documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed account. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When these 
problems mushroomed, involving his family’s health issues, his wife’s injuries, and the 
periodic unemployment by both his wife and himself, his finances continued to go 
steadily down hill and out of control. After a lengthy period of inaction during which he 
did not address his creditors, Applicant finally initiated some good-faith efforts to 
address some accounts before the hearing was conducted, but after the SOR was 
issued. He also prepared his repayment proposal. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the unemployment and reduced earnings were, at times, circumstances beyond 
his control, Applicant continued to obtain services and goods from a variety of creditors, 
but either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued to 
 
14 
                                      
 
                                                          
accumulate delinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. Nevertheless, since August 
2005, with the exceptions described above in late 2009, he did not make significant 
good-faith efforts to pay a variety of delinquent debts. He actually made some small 
payments to a few creditors. But, he generally ignored the remaining creditors until the 
hearing. Instead, he prepared a repayment plan, without concurrence from his creditors, 
and made a number of promises to follow his repayment plan. Yet, despite the passage 
of time, there is little documentation to support his contentions that he had actually 
commenced his promised payments in compliance with his repayment plan. Now, five 
years after his debts were discharged under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he is making 
promises to address his remaining delinquent debts. His long-standing failure to repay 
creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange payment plans, while creating 
new debts, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security 
clearance.  
 
I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put 
Applicant’s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of 
this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.81 His insufficient good-faith efforts or evidence to reflect actual 
payments to his SOR creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:82 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
81 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

Although there are some positive signs, such as efforts to take corrective actions, 
and maintenance of some of his payments on his daily living expenses, these steps are 
simply insufficient to show he can “live within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations.” See AG ¶ 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
