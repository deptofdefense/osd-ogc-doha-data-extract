GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding the personal conduct and 
financial considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 25, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
ESPQ version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date in 
2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of 
interrogatories pertaining to his financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories 
on August 25, 2009.2 On September 23, 2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated March 25, 2004.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated August 25, 2009).

for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006) (hereinafter AG). The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and F (Financial 
Considerations). It detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 9, 2009. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated October 19, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on December 14, 2009, and the case was 
assigned to Administrative Judge Thomas Crean on January 14, 2010. It was 
reassigned to me on March 4, 2010, due to Applicant’s deployment to Haiti and 
anticipated unavailability until June 2011. He returned earlier than initially expected. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on March 18, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on April 22, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, 8 Government exhibits and 13 Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was 
received on May 5, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of the Guideline F factual 
allegations (¶ 2.c.), denied the Guideline E factual allegation (¶ 1.a.), and two of the 
Guideline F factual allegations (¶¶ 2.a. and 2.b.). 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a network engineer,3 and he is seeking to retain a security clearance. He had previously 
been granted a TOP SECRET security clearance.4 Applicant was born in Vietnam in 
1956,5 escaped by boat to the Philippines,6 resided in a refugee camp in the 
Philippines,7 and in 1981, immigrated to the United States.8 He earned a Bachelor of 
Science degree in electrical engineering in June 1986.9 He became a naturalized U.S.

citizen in September 1986.10 From August 1981 until December 1996, when he 
commenced his current employment with the defense contractor, Applicant was 
employed by a number of employers in a variety of positions.11 Applicant indicated on 
various home loan documents, and his DD Form 398, that he was married,12 and on his 
SF 86 that he was “never married.”13 While his relationship with the particular woman in 
question involved residing together from 1983 to 1997, a separation of an unspecified 
length, and a resumption of the relationship until 2000,14 as well as two children born to 
them (daughters born in 1983 and 1986, respectively),15 in reality, they were never 
legally married.16 Applicant married another woman in September 2009.17 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1994. During 
the period 1994 through 1997, Applicant and his then live-in girlfriend frequented 
casinos where they watched musical entertainment and gambled.18 While he gambled 
to a limited degree, playing slot machines and roulette, because he did not really enjoy 
gambling,19 his girlfriend did it as a hobby, playing blackjack and roulette, and had a 
serious problem with gambling.20 They were co-applicants on several credit cards and 
credit lines, and, initially with his acquiescence, those cards and lines were generally 
used by her to fund her gambling activities.21 Transaction Reports by Casino (CTRC) 
from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, indicate seven relatively large 
transactions involving Applicant.22 On various occasions during that time period, they 
used funds from his home equity line of credit and credit cards to fund the trips to 
casinos.23 They purchased chips or tokens from three different casinos in the following

CTRC is inconclusive as no specific amount is registered.30 Applicant estimated that 
during that entire period, his girlfriend may have won a total of $5,000.31  
 
Applicant contends that during some of the casino trips they may not have used 
all the chips and tokens previously purchased, and some of those chips and tokens 
were exchanged back into cash to be spent later paying bills.32 At some point in 1996, 
aware of his mounting bills, Applicant attempted to persuade his girlfriend to give up 
gambling, but she refused to do so.33 Unable to keep up with payments because of her 
gambling activities, and with credit card debt rising to $40,000,34 accounts became 
delinquent. The girlfriend moved out of the house in 1997, and about that same time, he 
met with a bankruptcy attorney. In October 1997, he filed for bankruptcy, and his 
unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
January 1998.35  
 
From 1997 until 2006, Applicant continued traveling to casinos for weekends, 
three times per year,36 primarily to join with friends from the Vietnamese community for 
fun and to watch musical entertainment.37 He spent approximately $1,000 on each trip, 
including travel, lodging, entertainment, and gambling.38  
 
In October 2000, Applicant sold the residence he owned with his girlfriend, and 
received $39,075 at settlement.39 Of that amount, pursuant to a previous agreement,

Applicant retained $10,000, and his girlfriend received the remainder,40 to take care of 
their children.41 In September 2009, he sold a condominium and received $11,908 at 
settlement.42 Applicant’s current financial situation is fully rehabilitated since his 
bankruptcy. As of April 2010, he had a vested balance of over $71,600 in one of his 
401(k) accounts,43 and over $101,025 in another one of his 401(k) accounts.44 His 
credit scores, as of March 2010, range between 718 and 739.45 Applicant’s annual 
salary is $85,000.46 His salary is sufficient to pay all of his normal monthly expenses.47 
According to the most recent credit report in evidence, Applicant pays each of his open 
accounts as agreed.48 He has no negative accounts or collections 49
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 During an interview conducted by an investigator from the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) on March 2, 2006, Applicant was questioned about his gambling 
activities. It appears that the question was “if he gambles.”50 He initially denied that he 
gambles, but when shown the CTRC reports, he modified his response.51 The 
Government contends his initial response constituted providing false information during 
the security clearance process. Applicant was subsequently asked about his concept of 
the word “gamble,” as well as to describe his actions in the casinos. He believes 
gambling is to make money.52 If you “play a little bit” while hanging out waiting for a 
show to start, that is not gambling, it is “just for fun.”53 He contends his primary purpose 
was to drive his girlfriend to the casinos and wait for her while she played. Sometimes 
he would walk outside with his children and go to the boardwalk, and other times he

as well as confusing. 
 
Character References 
 
Two of Applicant’s work colleagues, both of whom have known him for over eight 
years, as well as two other work colleagues, both of whom have known him for less 
than three years, have characterized him in very favorable terms. Applicant is described 
as very industrious, trustworthy, honest, dedicated, highly respected, resourceful, 
creative, and diligent.55 In his 2009 annual performance appraisal, his immediate 
supervisor gave Applicant an overall rating of “meets/occasionally exceeds 
expectations.”56   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”57 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”58   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of

variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”59 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”61 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”62 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
59 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. 
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, under ¶ 19(i), “compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated 
by an unsuccessful attempt to stop gambling, “chasing losses” (i.e. increasing the bets 
or returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling losses, 
borrowing money to fund gambling or paying gambling debts, family conflict or other 
problems caused by gambling,” is potentially disqualifying. 
 
As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
1994, when his spouse-like relationship with his girlfriend, the mother of his two 
daughters, started to encounter difficulties associated with her gambling. As noted 
above, he gambled to a limited degree, playing slot machines and roulette, because he 
did not really enjoy gambling, but his girlfriend did it as a hobby, and had a serious 
problem with gambling. As co-applicants on several credit cards and credit lines, with 
his acquiescence, she used those cards and lines to fund her gambling activities. Over 
time, they purchased $75,600 worth of chips or tokens. Unable to keep up with 
payments because of her gambling activities, and with credit card debt rising to 
$40,000, accounts became delinquent. At about the same time his girlfriend moved out 
of the house in 1997, he met with a bankruptcy attorney, and in October 1997, he filed 
for bankruptcy. His unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code in January 1998. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG ¶ 19(i) only 
partially applies, for while he did “borrow” money to fund gambling, the gambling was 
his girlfriend’s gambling, not his own, and the compulsion or addictive nature of the 
gambling was hers and not his. Furthermore, the family conflict was generated not by 
his gambling, but rather because he could not prevail upon his girlfriend to stop doing 
so. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
 
9 
                                      
 
                                                          
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@63  
 
Applicant’s previous financial problems commenced in 1994, and ceased in late 
1997, with his discharge in bankruptcy. Because he no longer resides with his girlfriend, 
and has not done so for over 10 years, and is now married to another woman, the 
circumstances of his girlfriend’s gambling compulsion and its impact on his finances are 
not likely to recur. Likewise, his financial difficulties commenced due to her compulsion 
and his somewhat irresponsible acquiescence in permitting her to use credit cards and 
lines of credit, thereby enabling her behavior. Her gambling compulsion was a condition 
that was largely beyond his control. By attempting to curtail her gambling or use of the 
credit cards and lines of credit, he eventually acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. Applicant receives significant application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) for 
stopping the compulsive gambling of his girlfriend and separating from her. 
 
Likewise, Applicant’s actions merit substantial application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while 
he may not have received counseling for his girlfriend’s gambling compulsion, as far as 
his financial situation is concerned, since the discharge of his unsecured debts in 1997, 
Applicant’s financial situation has improved dramatically to the point where it appears 
that any former gambling issues are fully resolved. He now is a homeowner with 
outstanding credit, a continuing good salary, and substantial savings. With his 
girlfriend’s absence, and his efforts to remain debt-free following his 1997 bankruptcy, 
his financial difficulties have been resolved.64  
63 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply because of the Appeal Board’s earlier quoted decision 
that “an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the 
benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].”65  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(b), “deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant 
facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other 
official government representative,” may raise security concerns. Similarly, under AG ¶ 
16(e), “personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in 
activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, professional, or community 
standing. . . ” may raise security concerns.  
 
During his OPM interview on March 2, 2006, Applicant was questioned about his 
gambling activities, and apparently asked “if he gambles.” He initially denied that he did, 
but when shown the CTRC reports, he modified his response. The Government 
contends that initial response constituted providing false information during the security 
clearance process. While Applicant may have initially given a negative response, there 
is no evidence that his response was a deliberate attempt to provide false or misleading 
information. Obviously, from a cursory review of the CTRC records, it looks as though 
Applicant was funding his gambling compulsion and might have been attempting to 
minimize it. However, upon further examination and consideration, the combination of 
his girlfriend’s gambling compulsion, his minimum participation in gambling, and his 
apparently somewhat limited English abilities, I can find no evidence of a deliberate 
falsification. There is only some confusion over the meaning of the word “gambling.” I 
find Applicant’s explanations are credible in his denial of deliberate falsification.66 AG ¶ 
16(b) has not been established.  
 
 
65 See ISCR Case No. 02-30304, supra note 63, at 3. 
 
66 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. For three years 
he experienced financial difficulties by enabling his girlfriend’s gambling compulsion by 
his somewhat irresponsible acquiescence in permitting her to use credit cards and lines 
of credit. That compulsion resulted in the use of $75,600 worth of financial assets and 
an eventual bankruptcy in 1997. Eventually, he resolved to stop the situation, and he 
and his girlfriend parted ways. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant intervened in his girlfriend’s compulsive gambling and cut off her pool of funds 
when he declared bankruptcy and they split up. It is significant that once his financial 
delinquencies were resolved, and his relationship was dissolved, he no longer 
experienced financial difficulties. To the contrary, he has become a model citizen, 
husband, caring father, and good credit risk. His financial portfolio is now outstanding. 
And, he has not been to a casino for gambling or even entertainment since 2006.  
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or his 
gambling activities are under control; it is whether his financial circumstances raise 
concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one 
factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history and personal conduct 
in an unsympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of 
the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally 
permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case 
under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
explain the omission.

analysis.67 His overall efforts and evidence to satisfactorily explain the circumstances 
highlighted in the SOR, are sufficient to mitigate any continuing security concerns. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:68 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Ever since Applicant separated from his girlfriend and had his unsecured debts 
discharged in 1997, there are a significant positive signs in Applicant’s favor that are 
sufficient to show he can “live within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations.” See AG ¶ 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without substantial 
questions or doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations and rebutted the personal conduct alleged. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
