GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign influence.  Eligibility 
for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 11, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86).1 On an unspecified 
date in 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set 
of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on June 25, 2009.2 On October 
8, 2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated September 11, 2008. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 25, 2009).

Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the Department of 
Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG). The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 15, 2009. In a sworn, written statement, 
dated November 2, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on February 25, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on 
March 8, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 18, 2010, and I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on April 21, 2010. 
 
During the hearing, two Government exhibits and nine Applicant exhibits were 
received without objection. Applicant and one other witness testified on his behalf. The 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2010. 
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
At the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take 
administrative notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to the Arab Republic of 
Egypt (Egypt), appearing in a written submission of the request. The original request 
was received on February 25, 2010, and included five documents.3 On April 13, 2010, 
an amended request was received, and included six documents, some of which were 
updated versions of the earlier submission.4 The original request was withdrawn, but 
some of the attached documents were transferred over to the amended request.5 Facts 
are proper for administrative notice when they are verifiable by an authorized source 
and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the source information relied 
upon by the Government was publications of the Department of State6 and the 
Congressional Research Service.7

After weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the 
relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, I take administrative 
notice that the facts and events described in the documents occurred.8 Pursuant to Rule 
201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth 
below under the Egypt subsection. 
 
During the proceeding, Department Counsel also moved to amend the SOR to 
conform to the expected evidence. Specifically, she sought to amend subparagraph 1.d. 
thereof by deleting the year “2001” and substituting therefore the year “2000.” There 
being no objection by Applicant, the motion was granted and the SOR was amended as 
described above. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in ¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. 
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
obtain a TOP SECRET security clearance. He had previously been granted a SECRET 
security clearance in June 2003.9 Since December 2002, he has been employed by 
various employers, including federal contractors, in a variety of positions, including 
systems engineer, linguist, and senior analyst.10 In November 2009, the federal 
contractor, for whom Applicant was working since September 2007, lost the contract 
and he and other employees on the contract were switched over to another federal 
contractor.11 Applicant’s colleagues and supervisors, both current and past, all support 
his application and characterize him in a very positive light, using terms such as: 
trustworthy, diligent, reliable, honest, loyal, professional, dedicated, dependable, and 
having integrity.12  
 
Applicant was born in Egypt in 1965,13 and resided there with his parents and 
two brothers, all of whom are Egyptian citizens.14  He attended an Egyptian university 
and, in 1988, he received a B.A. in Accounting.15 Immediately upon graduation, 
because of disagreements with his father, and with the hope of furthering his education,

Applicant immigrated to the United States where he obtained a U.S. Permanent 
Residence Card or “green card.”16 He joined a friend who had left Egypt two years 
earlier, and to save money for college, for seven or eight months, he worked on a farm 
picking fruits and vegetables.17 He subsequently worked as a cashier for a gasoline 
station for about a year, and then for five or six years with a bank.18 In 1990, he enrolled 
in some classes at a local college for 18 months.19 After attending another university 
from 1997 to 2001, Applicant was awarded a B.S. in Computer Inform 20
 
In July 1995, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy.21 Upon completion of his 
required active service, in July 1999, Applicant was released from active duty and given 
an honorable discharge.22 During his period of active duty, he was awarded the Good 
Conduct Medal, two Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, two Sea Service Deployment 
Ribbons, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, Battle Efficiency Award, and the National 
Defense Service Medal.23 
 
After active duty, Applicant entered the Naval Reserve where he remained until 
2002.24 In September 2001, in response to the terrorist attack in the United States 
earlier that month, he was mobilized for 13 months.25 He was awarded the Joint Service 
Achievement Medal for his meritorious service.26 In November 2002, he was transferred 
to the Army National Guard for one year and was subsequently honorably discharged in 
November 2003.27 In about 2008, Applicant re-enlisted in the Naval Reserve,28 and his 
unit is scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan in March 2011.29

Applicant had intended to apply for U.S. citizenship in 1994, but at the time, he 
was on a U.S. Navy cruise, so his actual application was delayed.30 He became a U.S. 
citizen in September 1997.31 At that time, and on several occasions thereafter, he took 
an oath of allegiance to the United States.32 In 2007, Applicant married a Venezuelan-
born naturalized U.S. citizen,33 and he and his wife have a son born in the United States 
in 2007.34 He also has another son born in the United States in 2002, from an earlier 
relationship.35  
 
Applicant’s parents were both born and raised in Egypt.36 Both are in their mid-
70s.37 His father was a clerk for a government ministry for over 20 years, and then ran 
his own family real estate business for several years before retiring due to poor 
health.38 Because he resigned from his government position before the required age of 
retirement, he is not eligible for a government pension.39 His current health is not very 
good.40 Applicant’s mother was a teacher for another government ministry for over 20 
years, but she retired with a pension some time ago.41 Neither parent is aware of what 
Applicant’s job is or what he does.42 They still reside in Egypt. 
 
Applicant has two younger brothers, both of whom were also born in Egypt.43 
The older brother is a college graduate who has worked for an American company in 
Kuwait since 2000.44 He is married to an Egyptian school teacher and they have two 
children.45 His younger brother, also a college graduate, is a lawyer who was unable to 
find employment as a lawyer. When he was not unemployed, as he was for a

Applicant does not consider himself a dual citizen of Egypt and the United States. 
Instead, he recognizes only his U.S. citizenship.51 When he took his oath of citizenship 
in 1997, he renounced allegiance to any foreign government.52 If his impression 
regarding dual citizenship is proven to be erroneous, he would willingly renounce any 
Egyptian citizenship he might still have.53 He obtained his first U.S. passport in 1998, 
and renewed it in 2002.54 He has not possessed an Egyptian passport since it expired 
in 1990,55 and no longer possesses any documents from the Egyptian Government.56 In

In December 2000, after nearly 12 years without seeing his family, Applicant 
returned to Egypt for a four-week visit.62 He stayed in his parents’ home during the 
entire period.63 While there, he spent three weeks working on a school project and 
studying.64 He used his U.S. passport during the trip, and had no contact with Egyptian 
authorities.65 In 2002, he was deployed for one month to the Middle East as part of a 
U.S. Central Command antiterrorism vulnerability assessment in Egypt.66 It is unclear if 
he had the opportunity to visit with his family. In August 2005, upon receiving a 
telephone call from his brother that their father had been hospitalized in critical 
condition. Applicant travelled to Egypt where the entire family spent nearly two weeks 
with his father in the hospital.67 He used his U.S. passport during the trip, and had no 
contact with Egyptian authorities.68 In August 2007, Applicant’s father had a relapse 
and, once again, was hospitalized in critical condition.69 Applicant travelled to Egypt to 
be with his parents and the one brother who could be at the hospital.70 He used his U.S. 
passport during the trip, and except for an unexplained two-hour delay when the 
authorities took his passport upon entering Egypt, he had no further contact with 
Egyptian authorities.71 
 
Except for the few trips back to Egypt, Applicant has not seen his family 
members since he arrived in the United States in 1988. He periodically speaks to his 
parents by telephone, and even less frequently, he speaks or exchanges e-mails with 
his brothers.72 He has no intention of ever returning to Egypt except for his parents’ 
emergencies.73

Egypt 
 
Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the second-most 
populous on the African continent. It is a republic with a strong executive and a 
developing economy. Egypt’s judicial system is based on European, primarily French, 
legal concepts and methods, and under Egypt’s current president, the courts have 
demonstrated increasing independence, and the principles of due process and judicial 
review have gained greater respect. Egypt is an important and strategic partner of the 
United States. The two countries enjoy a vibrant and friendly, though sometimes 
strained, relationship based on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace and 
stability, revitalizing the Egyptian economy, strengthening trade relations, and promoting 
regional security. Egypt is a key partner in the search for peace in the Middle East and 
resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Egypt played a key role during the 1990-
1991 Gulf crisis. Egypt helped assemble the international coalition and deployed 35,000 
Egyptian troops against Iraq to liberate Kuwait. The Egyptian contingent was the third-
largest in the coalition forces, after the United States and United Kingdom. The United 
States and Egypt participate in combined military exercises, including deployments of 
U.S. troops to Egypt. Every other year, Egypt hosts Operation Bright Star, a multilateral 
military exercise with the United States. It is the largest military exercise in the region. 
 
President Anwar el-Sadat introduced greater political freedom and a new 
economic policy, relaxing government controls over the economy and encouraging 
private, including foreign, investment. Liberalization also included the reinstitution of due 
process and the legal banning of torture. In 1978, the Camp David accords were signed 
by Egypt and Israel, and in 1979, the Egypt-Israel peace treaty was signed. In October 
1981, Islamic extremists assassinated President Sadat, and Hosni Mubarak, the Vice 
President since 1975, was elected President. He was subsequently confirmed by 
popular referendum for additional 6-year terms. 
  
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, Egypt, 
which has itself been the target of terrorist attacks, has been a key supporter of U.S. 
efforts against terrorists and terrorist organizations. Despite governmental action 
against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Egypt remains high. Major terrorist attacks 
where foreigners, including Americans, have been killed have occurred most recently in 
2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009. The Egyptian judicial system does not allow plea 
bargaining, and terrorists have historically been prosecuted to the full extent of the law, 
in either military tribunals or emergency courts.  
 
The United States designated Hamas and Hezbollah foreign terrorist 
organizations in 1997. Hamas’ control of the Gaza Strip poses a challenge for Egypt, 
which wants to keep Hamas isolated, but also seeks to minimize the public and regional 
Arab backlash it may receive for doing so. The secular Egyptian regime is opposed to 
Islamists wielding real political power, for it fears an Iranian-style revolution in Egypt. In 
April 2009, the Egyptian government uncovered a large Hezbollah cell clandestinely 
operating in Egypt. Prior to September 11, 2001, Hezbollah was responsible for more 
American deaths than any other terrorist group, and has bombed embassies and

military barracks, hijacked civilian airliners, and kidnapped or murdered innocent 
civilians.  
 
The U.S. State Department notes that Egypt's human rights record is poor and 
serious abuses continue in many areas, including: limitations on the right of citizens to 
change their government; the state of emergency that has been in place almost 
continuously since 1967; unwarranted lethal force and torture; arbitrary arrest; 
prolonged detention; poor conditions in prisons; executive branch limits on an 
independent judiciary; political prisoners and detainees; and restrictions on freedom of 
press, assembly, association, religion, and Internet freedom. The prison system, 
particularly detention facilities used for incarcerating suspected Islamist radicals, has 
come under increasing international scrutiny. 
 
Egypt considers all children born to Egyptian fathers to be Egyptian citizens even 
if they were not issued an Egyptian birth certificate or a passport.  
 
There is no evidence to indicate that Egypt is an active collector of U.S. 
economic intelligence and proprietary information, or that Egypt uses coercive 
measures to gain access to such information.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”74 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”75   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
74 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

and modified.

variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”76 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.77  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”78 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”79 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
76 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

Analysis 
 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in 
AG ¶ 6:       
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such 
considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United 
States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a 
risk of terrorism. 
The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, 
as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in 
a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is 
sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the 
compromise of classified information.80 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 7(a), “contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, 
friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact 
creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or 
coercion@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG ¶ 7(b), Aconnections to a 
foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest 
between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the 
individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that 
information@ may raise security concerns. AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) apply in this case.  
However, the security significance of these identified conditions requires further 
examination of Applicant’s respective relationships with his family members who are 
Egyptian citizen-residents or Egyptian citizen-Kuwait-residents to determine the degree 
of “heightened risk” or potential conflict of interest.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG ¶ 8(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the 
country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those 
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a 
position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, 
80 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 8, 2001).

organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.@ Similarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may 
apply where the evidence shows Athere is no conflict of interest, either because the 
individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or 
country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships 
and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of 
interest in favor of the U.S. interest.@ Also, AG ¶ 8(c) may apply where “contact or 
communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little 
likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.”   
Applicant’s relationship with his various family members is diverse. Those who 
are Egyptian citizen-residents, his mother, father, and one brother, require the most 
scrutiny. His relationship with his entire family, for the most part, was essentially by 
periodic long distance telephone contact from 1988, when he departed Egypt, until 
2000, when he returned for a visit. Thereafter, were it not for medical emergencies 
occasioned by his father’s hospitalizations in 2005 and 2007, the long distance 
telephone relationship would have remained unchanged. His relationship with his one 
brother who is in Kuwait working for a U.S. company is even more distant. While there 
were periodic telephone calls or exchanges of e-mails between them, Applicant has not 
seen this particular brother since 2005, as he could not meet with Applicant in 2007. 
Applicant has no intention of ever returning to Egypt except for his parents’ 
emergencies, and did not return for other family activities, such as his brother’s 
wedding. 
  
Despite the nature and infrequency of the respective relationships, those 
relationships remain rather close and caring. Applicant previously applied for immigrant 
visas for the entire family, and was informed in January 2010, that it should be approved 
in seven months. However, at the time the record closed, the approval was still being 
awaited.  
 
Applicant’s relationship with his spouse, a naturalized U.S. citizen-U.S. resident, 
is obviously much closer.  She does not hold a job outside the family home, but is a 
fulltime homemaker working on her nursing degree, raising their child. 
 
In assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant’s 
relatives or associates residing in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all 
relevant factors, including the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances, and 
the realistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character 
of the foreign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the 
government, within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is 
limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.81  In fact, the Appeal Board has 
cautioned against “reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between ‘friendly’ nations 
and ‘hostile’ nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.”82 Nevertheless, the 
81 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 
10, 2002).

relationship between a foreign government and the United States may be relevant in 
determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to attempt to 
exploit a resident or citizen to take action against the United States through the 
Applicant.  It is reasonable to presume that a friendly relationship, or the existence of a 
democratic government, is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign 
government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in 
that foreign country. 
 
The Government has argued that the presence of terrorists operating within 
Egypt’s borders heightens the risk for Applicant’s family members residing in Egypt. In 
such a situation, Egypt and all its citizens become the victims of terrorism. Of course, 
terrorists also operate within the borders of the United States, reducing the 
persuasiveness of this argument. In fact, Egypt has targeted Islamist radicals in 
attempts to disrupt their activities and return life in Egypt to normalcy, just as U.S. law 
enforcement strives to protect U.S. citizens from terrorists.  
 
As noted above, the United States and Egypt have a history of friendly relations 
making it less likely that the Egyptian government would attempt coercive means to 
obtain sensitive information. If such a heightened risk were to be present, it would, in all 
probability, come from the Islamist radicals rather than from Egyptian government 
sources. However, it does not eliminate the possibility that a foreign power would 
employ some non-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit his relatives. While 
Applicant has three family members still residing in Egypt, as well as one residing in 
Kuwait, there may be speculation as to “some risk” at the hands of terrorists, but that 
speculation, in the abstract, does not, without substantially more, establish evidence of 
a “heightened risk” of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or 
coercion against Applicant’s relatively low profile family members. 
 
There is a very low potential of forcing Applicant to choose between the interests 
of the United States and those of either Egypt or those family members. He has already 
served in the Middle East and is scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan in March 2011. As 
a general rule, an applicant’s prior history of complying with security procedures and 
regulations is considered, by the Appeal Board, to be of relatively low probative value 
for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the security concerns raised by 
that applicant’s more immediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances.83 However, the 
Appeal Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, 
where the applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his 
compliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of 
dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant 
contribution to the national security.84 The presence of such circumstances can give

Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006).

Bd. Nov. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).

credibility to an applicant’s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and 
report attempts at coercion or exploitation.85  
 
In 2002, Applicant coordinated a rather large number of antiterrorism vulnerability 
assessments of military sites and diplomatic missions throughout U.S. Central 
Command’s area of responsibility. His ability to speak multiple languages was a critical 
asset during the largest antiterrorism vulnerability assessment in Egypt, where he 
served as the primary conduit for the team chief providing clear communication between 
the team chief and host nation officials.86 Applicant’s overall military service 
demonstrates that Applicant has been willing to assume a high level of risk on behalf of 
the United States, and they constitute important evidence that Applicant’s ties and 
sense of obligation to the United States could be sufficiently strong that he “[could] be 
expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. . . .”87 He has met his 
burden of showing there is little likelihood that those relationships could create a risk for 
foreign influence of exploitation. AG ¶¶ 8(a) and 8(c) fully apply.  AG ¶ 8(b) partially 
applies. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has resided in the United

significant contribution to the national security.”) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR 
Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).

States since 1988, and became a U.S. citizen in 1997.  He married in the United States, 
and his closest family members are his wife and two children, all of whom reside in the 
United States.  As such, they are not vulnerable to direct coercion or exploitation, and 
the realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress with regard to them 
is low. As noted above, in 2002, Applicant was deployed for one month to the Middle 
East as part of a U.S. Central Command antiterrorism vulnerability assessment in 
Egypt. He was awarded the Joint Service Achievement Medal for his meritorious service 
during that deployment.  
 
Applicant’s relationship with his parents and one brother who are Egyptian 
citizen-residents, as well as the one brother who is an Egyptian citizen and Kuwait-
resident, is varied. Some are historically limited to rare visits with periodic telephone 
contacts, and some are generally limited to infrequent telephone or e-mail contacts.  
 
Egypt is not believed to be an active collector of U.S. economic, intelligence, or 
proprietary information, and there is no evidence that Egypt uses coercive measures to 
gain access to such information. Instead, Egypt is an important U.S. ally in the war on 
terror and the maintenance of stability in the Middle East. While there may be some 
international concern regarding human rights in Egypt, especially related to the prison 
system’s detention facilities that may be used for incarcerating suspected Islamist 
radicals, there is no evidence that the issue involves non-Islamist radical-individuals 
simply because of their relationship with U.S. citizens. It is very unlikely Egypt would 
forcefully attempt to coerce Applicant through his relatives still residing in Egypt. The 
presence of family members in Egypt without any affiliation or relationship to the 
government of Egypt, other than past employment in various offices not related to 
intelligence, military, or internal security, does not generate a realistic potential for 
exploitation.  
 
Like the United States, Egypt has been the target of terrorist attacks. But it 
remains a key supporter of U.S. efforts against terrorists and terrorist organizations. 
Nevertheless, despite governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism, 
primarily against foreign interests, remains high. After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  
(See AG ¶¶ 2(a)(1) through 2(a)(9).)  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence 
concerns.
