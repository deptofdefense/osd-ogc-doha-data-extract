HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
September 1998. His statement of reasons (SOR) lists 11 debts totaling $63,711. He 
did not provide proof of any payments or of any efforts to resolve any of his SOR debts. 
Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 27, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (Item 5). On 
April 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
(Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). 
 
On April 24, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a 
decision on the record (Item 4). A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated May 26, 2010, was provided to him on June 4, 2010, and he was afforded an 
opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.1 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on 
August 11, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. 
(Item 4) His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working in 
production support. (Item 5 at 6, 13) Most of his employment over the last decade has 
been as a technician. (Item 5 at 13-15) He received a graduate equivalency diploma 
(GED) in 1986. (Item 5 at 12) He has not attended college. (Item 5 at 12) Applicant has 
never served in the military. (Item 5 at 18) He married in 1989 and divorced in 2001. 
(Item 5 at 23) He remarried in 2005. (Item 5 at 22) His son was born in 1997, and his 
two daughters were born in 1992 and 2006. (Item 5 at 26, 27) He did not disclose any 
illegal drug use, alcohol-related offenses, or derogatory involvement with law 
enforcement on his May 27, 2009, security clearance application. (Item 5)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s unsecured, non-priority debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code in September 1998. (Item 4) As part of the bankruptcy process, he 
received financial counseling. He has 11 unpaid SOR debts, totaling, $63,711, which 
are as follows: 1.b ($2,516); 1.c ($5,718); 1.d ($12,091); 1.e ($3,557); 1.f ($1,883); 1.g 
($8,323); 1.h ($157); 1.i ($893); 1.j ($17,000); 1.k ($11,317); and 1.l ($256).  
 
Applicant’s mobile home was repossessed (resulting in the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j 
($17,000)). (Item 6 at 4-5) In September 2007, two credit cards became delinquent. Id. 
In March 2008, Applicant’s vehicle was repossessed and auctioned off (resulting in the 
 
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated May 28, 2010, and Applicant’s receipt is dated June 4, 
2010 (file). The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit 
information (file).  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($5,718)). Id.  Most of the other delinquent SOR debts resulted from 
credit cards. Id. at 4-5.   
 
In his May 27, 2009 security clearance application, Applicant listed his SOR 
debts and explained that some debts were due to his former spouse’s excessive 
spending, and at the end of 2006, a change in his employment resulted in a reduction in 
his income from $50,000 to $34,000. (Item 5; Item 6 at 4) He was unemployed from 
March 2008 to March 2009. (Item 5 at 2-9, 45; Item 6 at 4)  
 
On July 8, 2009, Applicant made a statement to an Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) investigator. (Item 6) Applicant told the OPM investigator that he 
has $1,000 left over after payment of his expenses. Id. at 5. He is using the $1,000 of 
discretionary funds to fix up his current house. Id. He hopes to sell the house, then 
purchase a new house. Id. at 5, 8. Then he plans to use any leftover funds to make 
arrangements to pay his delinquent debts. Id. Applicant did not give an indication of 
when he might be able to start repaying his creditors. Id. 
 
Applicant did not submit proof of payments on any of his SOR debts. He has not 
provided copies of any offers to pay his debts, any payment plans, or any 
documentation showing attempts to resolve his debts. He did not provide any 
documentation showing he was maintaining contact with his creditors.    
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.

AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM interview, and his SOR response.  
 
In September 1998, Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. His SOR lists 11 debts totaling $63,711. Some of his debts have 
been delinquent since 2007. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent 
SOR debts and is taking adequate steps to do so.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) has limited applicability. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged 
by insufficient income, unemployment, and to a limited extent his former spouse’s 
financial irresponsibility (they were divorced in 2001). However, his financial 
circumstances have been stable for approximately one year. Applicant was aware of 
and disclosed several delinquent debts on his May 27, 2009 security clearance 
application. There is insufficient evidence that he maintained contact with his creditors,3 
and there is a paucity of evidence concerning his overall financial circumstances.  There 
is no documentary evidence that he has attempted to pay or settle any of his SOR debts 
or attempted to establish payment plans with his creditors. His documented actions are 
insufficient to establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. Although he received financial counseling in 
1998 as part of his bankruptcy, he now has $63,711 in delinquent debt. Applicant did 
not provide a credible plan to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant cannot receive full 
credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, established payment plans (by 
making payments), adequately documented disputes of debts, or otherwise resolved 
any of his SOR debts. There are some initial, positive “indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control.” He has admitted responsibility for and promised to 
pay the SOR debts, showing some good faith mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).4 AG ¶ 20(e) 
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
is not applicable because Applicant did not provide documentation showing he disputed 
any of his SOR debts.  
  
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment for the last 
year. He has $1,000 left over each month after expenses. However, he did not provide 
proof of any payments to his SOR creditors, or otherwise show sufficient progress on 
his SOR debts. His documented efforts are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant is 42 years old. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit 
for volunteering to support the U.S. Government, as an employee of a contractor. There 
is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. There is no 
evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His unemployment, 
underemployment, reduction in income from his employment, divorce, and problems 
with his former spouse’s handling of her one or two credit cards contributed to his 
financial woes. I give Applicant substantial credit for admitting responsibility for 11 SOR 
debts totaling $63,711. He is also credited with disclosing his financial problems on his 
security clearance application. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, 
and mitigation.

The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His unsecured delinquent 
debts were discharged in 1998 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His post-
bankruptcy delinquent debt dates back to a 2007. He has chosen to spend his excess 
income to fix up his house, instead of paying any of his SOR creditors. He did not 
provide proof of any payments of his SOR debts even though one debt is $157, and 
another debt is $256. The issue of financial considerations was further emphasized 
when he received the SOR, yet he did not make any payments to his creditors. He had 
ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity to make greater 
progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He did not pay, start payments, document 
and justify any disputes, or otherwise resolve any SOR debts. He has not made 
repayment of his creditors a high-enough priority. His promises to pay his delinquent 
debts at some date in the future is insufficient to mitigate these debts because there is 
insufficient evidence to explain why he has not done more to address his SOR debts 
after becoming aware that they raised a security concern.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not fully mitigated, and he is not eligible for access to classified 
information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
