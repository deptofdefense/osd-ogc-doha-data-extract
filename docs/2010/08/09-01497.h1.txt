HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
December 1999. His statement of reasons (SOR) listed 18 debts totaling $20,025. He 
disputed three debts, and 15 debts totaling $18,293 are not resolved. Applicant stole 
telephone services, made a false sworn statement to a criminal investigator, forged a 
lieutenant colonel’s signature, falsified a security clearance application, lied to a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent, and used cocaine while holding a 
security clearance. Financial considerations and personal conduct concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 11, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (Item 5). On 
February 5, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct) (Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). 
 
On March 11, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested 
a decision on the record (Item 4). A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM), dated April 27, 2010, was provided to him on May 6, 2010, and he was 
afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. (file) The case was 
assigned to me on July 20, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.g, 1.j, 1.q, 
2.a, 2.c, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g, and 2.i (Item 4) For SOR ¶ 2.h, he admitted using cocaine while 
holding a security clearance on December 31, 2005, rather than in January 2006, as 
alleged in the SOR. (Item 4) His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working as a 
program administrator. (Item 5 at 6, 13) He attended college from 1983 to 1996 and 
2003 to 2004. (Item at 5 at 11-12) When he completed his October 11, 2007, SF 86, he 
estimated he would receive a bachelor’s degree in July 2008. (Item 5 at 12)  
 
Applicant served on active duty in the Army from 1990 to August 2005. (Item 5 at 
16-17, 34) From August 2005 to May 2006, Applicant served in the National Guard. 
(Item 5 at 15, 33) He married in 1990 and divorced in 1994. (Item 5 at 21-22) He 
remarried in 1994. (Item 5 at 20) His children were born in 1987 and 1989. (Item 5 at 
25-26). His stepchild was born in 1982. (Item 5 at 26)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s unsecured, non-priority debts, totaling $48,438, were discharged 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in December 1999. (Item 1, Item 7 at 3) His 
SOR lists 18 unpaid SOR debts, totaling $20,025, which are as follows: 1.b ($485); 1.c 
($247); 1.d ($259); 1.e ($171); 1.f ($522); 1.g ($347); 1.h ($5,883); 1.i ($785); 1.j ($199); 
 
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated April 28, 2010, and Applicant’s receipt is dated May 6, 2010 
(file). The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit 
information (file).  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

1.k ($673); 1.l ($4,260); 1.m ($204); 1.n ($362); 1.o ($55); 1.p ($137); 1.q ($3,897); 1.r 
($500); and 1.s ($1,039).  
 
Applicant disputes eight SOR debts because he believes they were discharged in 
his December 1999 bankruptcy: 1.f ($522), 1.h ($5,883), 1.k ($673), 1.l ($4,260), 1.m 
($204), 1.n ($362), 1.p ($137), and 1.s ($1,039). (Item 4) Applicant’s October 24, 2007 
credit report shows the accounts for the following debts were opened on the following 
dates: 1.l ($4,260—March 2005); 1.m ($204—July 2006); 1.n ($362—May 2007); and 
1.p ($137—February 2005). (Item 8 at 2, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 17) Applicant’s February 
22, 2009 credit report indicates the accounts for the following debts were opened on the 
following dates: 1.f ($522—December 2006); 1.k ($673—June 2004); and $1.h 
($5,883—March 2005). (Item 9 at 2) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.s ($1,039) is based on a 
judgment filed on June 29, 1994. (Item 14 at 2) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.s ($1,039) was 
automatically included in his bankruptcy even though it was not listed on a bankruptcy 
schedule. See Financial Considerations Analysis, infra.    
  
Applicant’s credit reports reflect disputes of the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.b ($485), 1.e 
($171), 1.f ($522), and 1.j ($199); however, he admitted responsibility for the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.j in his SOR response. (Item 4; Item 9 at 2; Item 10 at 1, 2; Item 11 at 
1; Item 12 at 6, 8) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f are accepted as currently in dispute.  
 
On November 20, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
questioned Applicant about his debts. Applicant said he had some difficulty obtaining 
full-time employment in 2005 after leaving active duty, and he had some funeral 
expenses from the deaths of his grandparents in 2005. (Item 12 at 5) He received 
financial counseling in connection with his bankruptcy in 1999; however, he did not 
receive any recent financial counseling. (Item 12 at 10) For most of the debts listed on 
his credit report, Applicant said he would contact the creditor, inquire about the account, 
and if it is determined to be his debt, he would pay it. (Item 12 at 6-9) Applicant did not 
provide documentation or correspondence written to the creditors to inquire about the 
status of any accounts. He did not provide correspondence received from the SOR 
creditors such as responses to inquiries, or offers to settle debts. He did not provide 
proof that he made any payments to any of the SOR creditors.    
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 Theft of Telephone Services and False Swearing in 1991 
 
 In 1991, Applicant used a calling card number that he took without permission to 
make telephone calls costing more than $100. (Item 16 at 2) On January 3, 1992, he 
made a sworn statement to a law enforcement investigator claiming another service 
member had authorized him to use the telephone card, and claiming he did not know 
anyone else who had used the calling card number. Id. at 3, 7, 8.  
 
On January 9, 1992, Applicant made a sworn statement to a law enforcement 
investigator where he said he found the telephone calling card on his own desk at his 
workplace mixed in with some paperwork. Id. at 11. He admitted that he falsely accused 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
another soldier of providing the calling card to Applicant because he was angry about 
an argument. Id. He falsely understated the degree of his misuse of the telephone 
calling card in his prior sworn statement. Id. at 3, 11, 17. Applicant also admitted that he 
gave the telephone calling number information to another soldier (his roommate), who 
made calls using the stolen card number. Id. at 15-16.  
 
In April 1992, Applicant received non-judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15, 
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for obtaining services under false pretenses 
and false swearing. His commander imposed: (1) forfeiture of $455 pay per month for 
two months (suspended); (2) reduction from E-4 to E-2; (3) restriction for 45 days; and 
(4) extra duty for 45 days. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a to 2.c; Item 1; Item 4)     
 
 Falsification of SF 86 in 1998 
 
 On December 15, 1998, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86). Section 23e of his SF 86 asks, “In the last 7 years, have you 
been subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ? 
(Include non-judicial, Captain’s mast, etc.).” Applicant falsely answered, “No” 
deliberately failing to disclose the NJP described in the previous section. (SOR ¶ 2.e; 
Item 1; Item 4)  
 
False Statement to a DSS Special Agent in 2001 
 
On April 26, 2001, Applicant told a DSS special agent that a soldier gave him the 
calling card in 1991 and told him he could use it to make free calls. (Item 18 at 3) 
Applicant claimed he believed he was authorized to make the free calls for morale 
purposes. Id. He said he was charged with false swearing for admitting he copied the 
card from the victim’s desk. Id. He also said he thought the false swearing charge was 
dropped. Id. The record of the NJP itself is not part of the record evidence. SOR ¶ 1.d 
alleges that Applicant lied to the DSS special agent when he denied having any 
knowledge that the phone calling card number had been stolen, whereas in truth, he 
had found the number himself.     
 
 Forgery in 2004 
 
In August 2004, Applicant received NJP for forging the signature of an 
authorizing official (a lieutenant colonel) on his Request for Waiver of Tuition Assistance 
Reimbursement, in violation of Article 123, UCMJ. His commander imposed: (1) 14 days 
extra duty (suspended); (2) forfeiture of seven days pay ($626); and a letter of 
reprimand. (SOR ¶ 2.f; Item 1; Item 4; Item 19 at 18) The letter of reprimand was filed in 
Applicant’s Official Military Personnel File. (Item 19 at 18) When he completed his 
October 11, 2007, SF 86, he disclosed the forgery and NJP resolution of this offense. 
(Item 5 at 37-38)  
 
 As a result of the misconduct described in the previous paragraph, Applicant’s 
security clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
suspended. In January 2005, his security clearance and SCI access was reinstated with 
a warning. (SOR ¶ 2.g; Item 1; Item 4)     
  
Cocaine Use on December 31, 2005 
 
On December 31, 2005, Applicant used cocaine. He said it was because of 
stress due to underemployment, expenses for his grandparent’s funerals, and back 
pain. (Item 12 at 5) At that time, he was in possession of a Department of Defense 
security clearance. (SOR ¶ 1.h; Item 1; Item 4) Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis 
test for the presence of the cocaine metabolite in January 2006 at his National Guard 
unit. In July 2006, the National Guard discharged him because of his use of cocaine, 
and he received an honorable discharge. (SOR ¶ 2.i; Item 1; Item 4) When he 
completed his October 11, 2007, SF 86, he disclosed the single cocaine use detected 
through the January 2006 urinalysis test. (Item 5 at 38) He did not receive any drug 
abuse treatment or counseling. (Item 12 at 6) 
 
Awards from Military Service 
 
Applicant has received one Meritorious Service Medal, four Army Commendation 
Medals, three Army Achievement Medals; four Army Good Conduct Medals; two 
National Defense Service Medals; one Korea Service Medal; two Overseas Ribbons; 
one Army Service Ribbon; two Professional Development Ribbons; one Global War on 
Terrorism Service Medal; one unit award, and several other awards or commendations. 
(Item 20) By order dated July 16, 2006, he left the National Guard as a staff sergeant 
and the character of his service was described as Honorable. (Item 20) The reason for 
his discharge was “ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUG ABUSE REHABILITATION 
FAILURE.” (Item 20) He had 16 years service towards military retirement. (Item 20)     
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In 
ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM interview, and his SOR response.  
 
In December 1999, Applicant’s unsecure, non-priority debts were discharged 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His SOR lists 18 debts totaling $20,025. 
Some of his debts have been delinquent since 2005. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent 
SOR debts and is taking adequate steps to do so.  
 
Applicant’s underemployment in 2005 and expenses relating to the death of his 
grandparents prior to December 2005 were unexpected events that damaged his 
finances. He may have also had some unexpected medical expenses because of his 
back problems. He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances 
over the last three years. There is insufficient evidence that he maintained contact with 
his creditors,3 and there is a paucity of evidence concerning his overall financial 
circumstances. There is no documentary evidence that he has attempted to pay or 
settle any of his SOR debts or attempted to establish payment plans with his creditors. 
His documented actions were insufficient to establish he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. Although he received financial counseling in 
1999 as part of his bankruptcy, he now has additional delinquent debt. Applicant did not 
provide a credible plan to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant cannot receive full 
credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, established payment plans (by 
making payments) or otherwise resolved any of his SOR debts. There are some initial, 
positive “indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has 
admitted responsibility for and promised to pay several SOR debts, showing some good 
faith mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).4  
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
 AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to three debts. Two debts were documented as disputed 
in his credit reports (1.e ($171) and 1.f ($522)), and he did not subsequently admit 
responsibility for those two debts in his SOR response. Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.s ($1,039) was part of his bankruptcy. Civil court records establish the judgment in 
SOR ¶ 1.s predated his bankruptcy. Absent fraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy all 
unsecured, non-priority debts are discharged when the bankruptcy court grants a 
discharge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code even when they are not listed on a 
bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis v. 
Nat’l Revenue Service, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010).   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. After deducting three disputed debts (SOR 
¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.s), 15 unresolved SOR debts remain and total $18,293. He did not 
provide proof of any payments to his SOR creditors, or otherwise show sufficient 
progress on his SOR debts. His documented efforts are simply inadequate to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Personal Conduct  
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
With respect to the personal conduct concerns involving the allegations in the 
SOR, there are five pertinent disqualifying conditions. AG ¶¶ 16(a) to 16(e) provide: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative;  
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: 
 
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client 
confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of 
sensitive corporate or other government protected information: 
 
(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  
 
(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; 
 
(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time 
or resources; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another 
country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is 
legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a 
basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence 
service or other group.  
 
In his SOR response Applicant admitted the following misconduct: (1) On 
January 3, 1992, he made a false sworn statement when he denied knowledge of 
anyone else who used the stolen calling card whereas Applicant provided the calling 
card number to his roommate (SOR ¶ 2.c); (2) He committed a theft of telephone 
services of over $100 (SOR ¶ 2.a); (3) On December 15, 1998, he deliberately failed to 
disclose the NJP he received for theft of telephone services in 1991 on his SF 86 (SOR 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
¶ 1.e); (4) In 2004, he forged the signature of a lieutenant colonel on his Request for 
Waiver of Tuition Assistance (SOR ¶ 1.f); (5) On December 31, 2005, Applicant used 
cocaine while holding a security clearance (SOR ¶ 1.h). AG ¶¶ 16(a) through 16(c) 
apply. 
 
In his SOR response Applicant denied ¶ 2.d, which alleged on April 26, 2001, 
Applicant made a false statement to a DSS special agent. Applicant told the DSS 
special agent that a soldier gave Applicant the calling card in 1991 and told him he 
could use it to make free calls. Applicant claimed he believed he was authorized to 
make the free calls for morale purposes. Despite Applicant’s denial of responsibility in 
his SOR response for SOR ¶ 2.d, I find he knowingly and deliberately attempted to 
deceive the DSS special agent into believing that Applicant thought he was authorized 
to use the calling card to make long distance calls.  
 
AG ¶ 16(d)(3) does not apply because Applicant’s theft of telephone services, 
forgery, false swearing, as well as his cocaine possession and use are covered under 
the criminal conduct guideline, as all rules involved, when violated, are criminal offenses 
under the UCMJ. 
  
Certainly, such crimes violate important civil and criminal rules in our society, and 
these offenses are conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a 
person’s professional and community standing. Thus, AG ¶ 16(e)(1) applies. Further 
inquiry concerning the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
 
AG ¶ 17 provides for seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
The mitigating condition outlined in AG ¶ 17(e), “the individual has taken positive 
steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress” 
applies to mitigate AG ¶ 16(e)(1). Security officials are well aware of Applicant’s 
offenses, and his conduct is well-documented in law enforcement, security, and 
personnel records. The federal government’s knowledge of these allegations eliminates 
any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe Applicant would 
compromise national security to avoid public disclosure of these offenses. Any personal 
conduct security concerns (pertaining to disclosure of his criminal conduct as alleged in 
the SOR) are mitigated.   
 
The sole allegation in SOR ¶ 2.g is that Applicant’s security clearance and SCI 
access were suspended. The sole allegation in SOR ¶ 2.i is that Applicant was 
discharged from the Army National Guard after he tested positive for the cocaine 
metabolite in his urine. The conduct described in SOR ¶¶ 2.g and 2.i were actions by 
security or command officials (which resulted from Applicant’s conduct, alleged in other 
SOR paragraphs). I find for Applicant because Applicant himself did not engage in any 
personal conduct raising a security concern, and essentially these two SOR allegations 
are indirect duplications describing measures taken against Applicant for his conduct.   
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions detailed in AG ¶¶ 16(a) through 16(c). Applicant’s criminal conduct must be 
considered as a whole. There is a pattern of dishonesty from 1991 to 2004 followed by 
his cocaine use while holding a security clearance. There is insufficient mitigating 
evidence to convince me that this pattern of behavior will not continue in the future. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance, there are several factors tending to support approval of his 
clearance. Applicant is 46 years old. He should have received his bachelor’s degree in 
July 2008. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security 
responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. 
Government, as an employee of a contractor and during his 15-year-career in the Army. 
He earned one Meritorious Service Medal, four Army Commendation Medals, three 
Army Achievement Medals, four Army Good Conduct Medals, as well as additional 
awards and commendations during his Army service. He was promoted to the grade of 
staff sergeant, and in 2006 his unit characterized his service as he Honorable. There is 
every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. There is no 
evidence that he abuses alcohol. His underemployment and expenses relating to the 
death of his grandparents were unexpected events that damaged his finances. I give 
Applicant credit for admitting responsibility for several SOR debts. He is also credited 
with promising to pay the debts that were established. These factors show some 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems for more than 10 years. His 
unsecured, non-priority delinquent debts were discharged in December 1999 under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His post-bankruptcy delinquent debt dates back to 
2005. After deducting three disputed debts, 15 unresolved SOR debts remain and total 
$18,293. He did not provide proof of any payments on any of his SOR debts. In 2007, 
he promised an OPM investigator that he would investigate and resolve his delinquent 
debts. The concern about his financial responsibility was further emphasized when he 
received the SOR. Yet he did not provide documentary proof of any payments to any of 
his SOR creditors. He had ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient 
opportunity to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. His promises 
to pay his delinquent debts at some date in the future are insufficient to mitigate his 
SOR debts. There is an absence of documentary evidence fully explaining why he has 
not done more to address his SOR debts after becoming aware that they raised a 
security concern.  
 
In 1991, Applicant took a telephone calling card and used it to make long 
distance calls costing more than $100. This conduct constituted theft of telephone 
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
services. On January 3, 1992, he made a false sworn statement when he denied 
knowledge of anyone else who used the stolen calling card whereas Applicant provided 
the calling card number to his roommate. On December 15, 1998, he deliberately failed 
to disclose the NJP he received in 1992 for theft of telephone services on his SF 86. On 
April 26, 2001, Applicant made a false statement to a DSS special agent, understating 
his culpability for the theft of telephone services in 1991. In 2004, he forged the 
signature of a lieutenant colonel on his Request for Waiver of Tuition Assistance. On 
December 31, 2005, Applicant used cocaine while holding a security clearance. This 
series of criminal acts raises serious personal conduct security concerns. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
and personal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated, and he is not eligible for access 
to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.g to 1.r: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.s:   For Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a to 2.f: Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 2.g:  For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.h:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.i:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
