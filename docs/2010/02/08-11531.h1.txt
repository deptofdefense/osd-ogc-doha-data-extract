Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  
(e-QIP) on July 10, 2008. On June 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 
1, 2006.  
  
 On July 31, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November 4, 
2009. The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2009. On November 12, 2009, a 
Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for December 1, 2009. The case 
was heard on that date. The government offered four exhibits which were admitted as 
Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 4. The Applicant testified and offered nine  exhibits 
which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - I. The record was held open until 
 
2 
 
 
December 15, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  He timely 
submitted a 14-page document that was admitted as AE J. Department Counsel’s 
response to AE J is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant also timely submitted a 
four-page document that was admitted as AE K. Department Counsel’s response to AE 
K is marked as HE II. The transcript (Tr) was received on December 10, 2009.  Based 
upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for a security 
clearance is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.  
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old security officer, employed with a Department of 
Defense contractor, who is applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his 
current employer for over a year and a half. He previously held a security clearance 
from 1990 to 1995. He is a high school graduate. He is married and has two 
stepchildren, a stepdaughter, age 23, and a stepson, age 21. All of his stepchildren live 
with him and his wife. His stepdaughter’s husband and baby also live with them. (Tr at 
4-5, 48-49; Gov 1.)  
 
Applicant’s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has a 
history of financial problems. On July 21, 2000, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
Approximately $25,000 in debts were discharged. Most of the debts consisted of an 
automobile repossession and credit cards. Applicant had a low paying job and over-
extended himself. (Tr at 23; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 4)  
 
Applicant also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 22, 1993. Approximately 
$5,000 in debts were discharged. In 1993, Applicant had credit card debt. He followed 
the bad advice of an attorney to file for bankruptcy. (Tr at 24) 
 
Applicant has the following delinquent accounts: a $212 medical collection 
account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 5); a $1,039 account 
placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 2 at 1); a $631 cell phone account placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 1); a $494 credit card account placed for collection 
(SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 6); a $978 credit card account placed for collection 
(SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 2 at 1); a $706 account that was charged off (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 2 at 1); 
a $76 medical account (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 2 at 1); and a $1,658 judgment. (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 
3 at 4) 
 
Additional delinquent accounts include: a $8,001 personal loan placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 2 at 1-2; Gov 3 at 7); a $4,006 credit card account placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 3 at 7); a $16,800 debt owed as a result of a truck 
repossession that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 3 at 8-9); an $877 account 
placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 3 at 8); a $226 account placed for collection (SOR 
¶ 1.o: Gov 3 at 9); a $245 insurance account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.p: Gov 3 at 
9); and a $560 insurance account placed for collection. (SOR ¶ 1.q: Gov 3 at 9) 
 
3 
 
 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant claims that he intends to take care all of 
his bills. He has not been able to pay his bills in the past because he was only making 
$30,000 a year. His stepdaughter got married last year, and he and his wife are paying 
for the costs of the wedding which was about $7,500. He and his wife purchased a 
house in June 2009 for $300,000. They paid about $10,000 as a down payment. 
Applicant discovered there were a lot of additional expenses when owning a home. The 
mortgage is in his wife’s name only because of his poor credit. They keep their accounts 
separate. He looked into financial counseling but never attended financial counseling. 
(Tr at  50, 54-55, 60) 
 
From 2002 to 2003, Applicant had several periods of unemployment. He was 
unemployed from March 2002 to September 2002. He was unemployed for a year in 
2003. His wife worked full-time. (Tr at 52-54; Gov 1)  
 
The current status of the delinquent accounts are: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c: $212 medical collection account: Applicant believes his insurance 
company should pay this debt, but decided that he is going to pay the debt. No proof 
was provided that the debt was paid at the close of the record. The debt is unresolved. 
(Tr at 23) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d: $1,039 collection account: Applicant cannot determine who the 
original creditor is on this account. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 26)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e: $631 cell phone account placed for collection: Applicant admitted this 
debt in his response to the SOR.  At the hearing, he disputed the debt. He claims he 
had an account with the cell phone company about four years ago and he paid the 
account. He claims he disputed the debt with the credit reporting agencies in the past 
and the debt was removed. He claims the credit reporting agencies put the debt back on 
his credit report.  The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 27-28) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f: $494 charged off account: Applicant admits this debt is still owed. The 
debt is unresolved. (Tr at 28) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g: $978 charged off credit card account: On December 1, 2009, 
Applicant agreed to a settlement. He agreed to settle the account for $400 in two 
installments of $200. The first payment was due on December 30, 2009.  The final 
payment is due on January 31, 2009.  The status of the debt is uncertain. (Tr at 29-30; 
AE H) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h: $706 bank account that was overdrawn: Applicant settled this 
account in late October 2009. (Tr at 30; AE G) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i: $76 medical co-pay: Applicant intends to pay this debt by the end of 
the year.  The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 30) 
 
 
4 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j: $1,658 judgment for a personal loan: Appellant claims that he paid 
$300 towards this judgment. He does not have a regular payment plan. He was given 
the opportunity to provide additional documents verifying payment after the hearing. He 
did not submit any documents. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 31-32) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.k ($8,001), 1.l ($4,006), and 1.m ($16,800), delinquent accounts with 
the same credit union placed for collection: Applicant originally agreed to pay $100 per 
month towards each debt, a total of $300 a month. He made three payments in 
February 2009, March 2009, and April 2009. He stopped making payments because he 
was unable to afford the payments. He renegotiated the payment agreement and now 
pays the credit union $100 per month for all three debts. His payments resumed in 
December 2009. (Tr at 32-40; Gov 4 at 6-8; AE I at 2; AE K at 2-4)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.n:  $877 collection account: Applicant admits to owing this debt. There 
is no payment plan yet. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 40-41) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o: $226 collection account: Debt was paid on April 23, 2009. (Tr at 41; 
AE A at 1) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.p: $245 insurance account placed for collection: The debt was paid in 
July 2009. (Tr at 41; AE A at 2)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.q: $560 insurance account placed for collection: Applicant disputes this 
account. He claims that he contacted the insurance company and they cannot find an 
account in his name. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 41-42; AE F) 
 
Applicant had several debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He paid off a 
$1,588 judgment owed to a bank on September 18, 2008. His wages were garnished to 
satisfy the judgment and costs. He paid $4,000 towards this debt. (Tr at 38-40; AE 4 at 
5) Applicant owes taxes to the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2002 and 2003. 
He is not sure how much he owes. He pays $205 a month pursuant to his agreement 
with the Internal Revenue Service. He hopes to pay the debt in full by the end of the 
year. (Tr at 43-44; Gov 4 at 14-15; AE J at 3-12)  
 
Applicant’s net monthly income is $2,484. His wife’s net monthly income is 
$2,800.  Their combined net monthly income is $5,284. Their mortgage payment is 
$1,781 (Their rent used to be $825). Other monthly expenses include: groceries $500, 
utilities $300, car payment $192, car insurance $200, cell phone $190, home phone 
$40, and clothing $50. Their total monthly expenses are $3,253.  Applicant and his wife 
have $2,031 left over each month to apply towards their debts. Applicant’s total monthly 
debt payments were not discussed during the hearing. The total amount of the debt 
payments listed on a personal financial statement prepared by Applicant on February 
24, 2009, is $2,465. As mentioned previously, the $300 monthly payment to the credit 
union has been reduced to $100 a month. Based on the evidence in the record and the 
reduced payment to the credit union, Applicant and his wife’s monthly debt payments 
 
5 
 
 
now total $2,265.  If this information is accurate, they have a negative monthly balance 
of $434. (Tr at 45-51; Gov 4 at 4)  
 
 Applicant’s 2008 performance review indicates that he met expectations. (AE B) 
The security manager at Applicant’s company states that he is very professional and 
responsive to ideas presented to him. He is eager to learn and is an excellent asset to 
the team. (AE J at 2) His supervisor in the mailroom from November 2005 to July 2008 
states that he is reliable and responsible. (AE C) Other co-workers have made similar 
favorable statements about Applicant. (AE D; AE E) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered 
in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
 
6 
 
 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
 Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant has had a long history of 
financial irresponsibility as evidenced by two Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges in 1993 
and 2000, and his current financial situation. The SOR alleged 15 delinquent accounts, 
an approximate total balance of $36,509.   
 
The government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has had difficulty managing his finances for over 17 years. While he has 
resolved some accounts, numerous accounts remain unresolved. Applicant has not 
demonstrated that he will be financially responsible in the future. Applicant’s history of 
 
7 
 
 
financial irresponsibility raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.  
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies because Applicant has had 
some periods of unemployment. He was out of work the entire year in 2003. However, 
Applicant has been employed full-time since 2004. There is no evidence that Applicant 
acted responsibly because the delinquent accounts are old and he took little action 
towards resolving these accounts. I cannot conclude that it was a wise decision to 
purchase a new home, albeit in his wife’s name, when Applicant had numerous 
unresolved debts. While circumstances beyond Applicant’s control contributed to some 
of Applicant’s financial problems, he has not acted responsibly with regard to his 
finances after finding full-time employment. 
   
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant looked into credit counseling but did not attend 
classes about properly managing his finances. While he has paid some accounts, and 
has payment agreements with two creditors, it is unlikely Applicant’s financial problems 
will be resolved in the near future considering the extent of his unresolved debt.   
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.h, 1.o, and 1.p. Most of his delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Partial credit is 
given to Applicant for entering into a repayment agreement with the credit union 
regarding the debts owed in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m. However, he was unable to meet 
the original terms of his repayment agreement after making two payments. He only 
recently began making payments again in December 2009. It is too soon to conclude 
that he will follow the terms of his repayment plan.  
 
FC MC ¶20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue) does not apply. While Applicant disputes the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, and 
1.d, he provided no documentation verifying the disputes and did not provide a 
substantiated basis for the dispute.  
 
Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  
  
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
8 
 
 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. 
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s two 
bankruptcy discharges in 1993 and 2000. I considered Applicant’s periods of 
unemployment in 2002 and 2003. I considered that Applicant resolved some of his 
delinquent accounts. However, a significant amount of delinquent debt remains. 
Applicant’s decision to purchase a home rather than resolve his financial issues raises 
questions about his judgment and reliability.  Despite two bankruptcy discharges, 
Applicant continued to incur delinquent debt. His long history of financial irresponsibility 
and the extent of his delinquent debt outweigh the steps Applicant has taken to resolve 
some of his delinquent accounts. He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial 
considerations and did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable 
clearance decision.   
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant

  Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
 
9 
 
 
  Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.m:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.p:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
