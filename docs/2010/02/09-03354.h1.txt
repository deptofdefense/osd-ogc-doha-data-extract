HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed one delinquent debt for $25,336. 
He admitted he borrowed about $3,000 from the creditor; however, he disputed the 
amount of his debt. He offered $200 to settle the debt. He did not take sufficient actions 
to address or resolve his SOR debt. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 15, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
October 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2).1 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On October 30, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (HE 3). On December 22, 
2009, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on his case. On 
January 4, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On January 7, 2010, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice (HE 1). On January 27, 2010, Applicant’s hearing was held. At 
the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) (Tr. 25-26), and 
Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 27; AE A-B). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 26), and AE A-B (Tr. 27-28). Additionally, I admitted the hearing 
notice, SOR, and response to the SOR as hearing exhibits (HE 1-3). On February 3, 
2010, I received the transcript. I held the record open until February 12, 2010, to permit 
Applicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 76, 80, 102). On February 12, 2010, I 
received seven exhibits from Applicant (AE C-I). Department Counsel did not object (HE 
4), and AE C-I were admitted into evidence that same day.  
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted that he had an account with creditor C, and 
that he borrowed or charged “approximately $3,000” (HE 3). However, he denied that 
he owed the creditor anything because he paid the $3,000 he owed. He objected to the 
charges and interest which increased the debt to over $25,000 (HE 3). He stated: 
 
[C] had claimed that I owed them about approximately $10,000.00. The 
correct amount was approximately $3,000.00. [C] never did send me a 
document showing me where this additional $7K came from. On the 
advice of [my credit counselor] I stopped paying them in May 2006 after I 
had paid what I really owed them. Since May 2006 over $20,000.00 has 
been added by someone to the initial amount [C] had claimed. Your 
correspondence states $25,336.00 is owed to [P, a collection company]. 
The collection letter [from N, a successor collector] states $32,694.64 is 
owed but will take $24,520.98 to close the matter.  .  .  .  I am only willing 
to pay them $200.00 for the sole purpose of immediately expunging my 
credit report of all negative information so I can have my secret clearance 
reinstated and obtain a TS clearance.

The following admissions from Applicant’s SOR response (HE 3) are accepted as 
findings of fact: (1) Applicant had an account with C (the original creditor); (2) he 
stopped making payments in May 2006 even though he knew C claimed he owed C 
thousands of dollars; (3) he received a collection letter from N (a successor collection 
agent to C) offering to settle the $32,695 debt to C for $24,521; and (4) he is willing to 
make a $200 counteroffer to settle his debt. Additional findings follow. 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old information technology contractor (Tr. 5, 8). He has 
held his current employment since January 2005 (Tr. 8; GE 1). In 1977, he graduated 
from high school (Tr. 6). He has attended college-level vocational education all of his 
life, and probably has the equivalent of a bachelors degree (Tr. 6). He married in 1984 
and divorced in 1990 (GE 1). He married his spouse in 2004 (GE 1). He does not have 
any children (GE 1). He has held a Secret security clearance for 10 years (Tr. 8).   
 
Applicant served in the Army from 1984 to 1990 and left active duty as a 
sergeant (E-5) (Tr. 7-8). He did not serve in any combat zones (Tr. 7). He received an 
honorable discharge (Tr. 7).  
 
Financial considerations 
 
From October 2003 to December 2004, Applicant was unemployed except for a 
part-time job in a pizza restaurant during the summer of 2004 (Tr. 28; GE 3). In 2003, 
Applicant had financial problems when his wife was sick and he lost his business (Tr. 
23, 25). His wife had to quit her job with the insurance industry (Tr. 81). From 2005 to 
2008, he worked hard and paid all of debts except one (Tr. 23).  
 
In 2002, a credit card was opened in Applicant’s name (AE C). Applicant 
disputed the charges and the disputed account was removed from his credit report (AE 
C). There is no evidence that any charges were fraudulently added to Applicant’s 
account with C. 
 
Applicant used credit cards to pay business expenses, and he paid three of them 
(Tr. 54). All three debts were reduced during the settlement process, and they “took off 
all the exorbitant penalties, and fees” (Tr. 55). He paid a total of about $30,000 to 
resolve the three credit card accounts (Tr. 55). However, he did not pay one credit card 
(C) (Tr. 54; SOR ¶ 1.a). His debt to C was his largest credit card debt at the time it 
became delinquent (Tr. 55).  
 
Applicant opened credit card account C about 14 years ago (Tr. 29-30). After 
Applicant’s hearing he provided two statements from C, dated August 21, 2005, and 
September 15, 2005, which included the following relevant information: On June 25, 
2005, July 6, 2005, July 19, 2005, July 29, 2005, August 2, 2005, and August 15, 2005, 
Applicant transferred the following sums to a Virginia bank (VB): $1,500; $2,000; 
$3,000; $4,000; $3,500 and $2,300 (AE E, F).3  
 
3Applicant wrote some comments on C’s statements (AE E, F). He indicated near the payments 
to VB, “where these charges come from have not been answered??” (AE E) and “This one shows $6,500

Total $16,300      
  
In August 2005, the creditor charged a $195 transaction fee on the cash 
advances (AE F). The annual interest charge was 29.49%; however, the transaction fee 
pushed the effective annual percentage rate up to 53.82%. In September 2005, the 
creditor charged a $294 transaction fee on the cash advances (AE E). The annual 
interest charge was 29.49%; however, the transaction fee pushed the effective annual 
percentage rate up to 52.84%. Over the 60-day period, he received $16,300 in cash, 
which was transferred to his VB credit card account. His balance for that 60-day period 
went from $15.06 to $16,269 (AE E).     
 
Applicant said from October 2003 to May 2006 he made monthly payments to C 
of about $500 per month (Tr. 68-69). He usually wrote a check for the minimum plus a 
couple of hundred dollars (Tr. 69). By May 2006, he was paying $1,800 per month (Tr. 
68). Applicant’s C account was current until May 2006 (Tr. 29, 32-33, 71). Applicant 
noticed that he owed $16,000 and wondered why he was not making any headway on 
his debt to C (Tr. 61-62). He telephoned the credit card company, and the person who 
talked to him was confused and promised to get back to him (Tr. 62). He never received 
anything in return (Tr. 63). In May 2006, Applicant made his last payment to C based on 
advice from his credit counselor (Tr. 20, 25, 29, 31, 33; GE 3 at 2).4 The balance in May 
2006 was about $16,000 (Tr. 30). He indicated the current balance was $31,000 (GE 3 
at 2). He disputed the amount of the debt (Tr. 20, 25). However, he did not have a copy 
of the letter disputing the debt (Tr. 39-40). He contended the true debt should be about 
$3,000 (Tr. 32, 35). He did not offer C $3,000 because, “I paid them way beyond $3,000 
I wasn’t going to let them – I wasn’t going to let them bleed me.” (Tr. 45).  
 
Applicant claimed he and his debt resolution company “could not contact them” 
(Tr. 34). After he stopped making payments, the creditor “just went silent” for three and 
a half years (Tr. 21, 25, 35).  The creditor “went off the radar map” (Tr. 36-37). However, 
the government’s credit reports, dated February 14, 2009, September 14, 2009, and 
November 24, 2009, all show the identity of the creditor as a well-known collection 
                                                                                                                                             
new activity?” (AE F). Another letter from Applicant’s debt resolution company, dated November 26, 2007, 
indicates a settlement agreement from VB for a credit card. It indicates a settlement offer of $6,500 was 
paid to VB on November 26, 2007, to resolve a $9,100 balance (AE G at 5).  At the hearing he said, 
“Well, apparently there [were] some charges put on there that [weren’t mine]” (Tr. 72). Although he did not 
seek written verification of the charges, he did telephone the creditor two or three times (Tr. 73). Then his 
credit counselor advised him not to pay C (Tr. 73-74).   
 
4Applicant sometimes referred to his credit counselor as his “legal counsel;” however, his credit 
counselor made it clear that he was not an attorney (Tr. 99; AE G at 8).

company (P), which is the same identity indicated in the SOR ¶ 1.a (Tr. 42; GE 3-5). 
Applicant contended he and his debt counselor had never heard of P (Tr. 42).  
 
In January 2009, Applicant’s debt resolution company informed Applicant the 
debt was sold to a third party (Tr. 37-38). However, they did not know the identity of the 
new account holder (Tr. 38). His debt resolution company advised Applicant of changes 
to his accounts every month (Tr. 38). 
 
On August 31, 2009, Applicant received a letter from N offering to settle the 
$32,694 debt for $24,520 (Tr. 45; HE 3 at 3).5 On October 29, 2009, Applicant offered to 
settle the debt for $200; however, he did not provide the $200 with his settlement offer 
(Tr. 45; HE 3 at 4).  
 
Applicant first learned that P was the account holder when he received the SOR 
(Tr. 43). Applicant wrote P, and on November 10, 2009, P responded, stating the 
current balance was $32,694, the charge off date was December 31, 2006, and the 
open date was December 21, 1998 (AE A).  
 
In sum, Applicant argued that C’s debt was dropped from his credit report (Tr. 21, 
25). He did not receive a summons from the creditor (Tr. 21, 25). Applicant sent a letter 
to the creditor offering to pay $200 if the debt would be removed from his credit report 
(Tr. 22, 25). The creditor did not respond to the $200 offer (Tr. 22, 25). He accused the 
creditor of not acting in good faith because his security clearance was at risk (Tr. 23, 
25).    
  
Applicant’s monthly net income is about $6,500, and his monthly mortgage is 
$3,000 (Tr. 57). He does not have any credit cards (Tr. 58). His net remainder after 
paying all expenses is about $2,500 (Tr. 58).   
 
Applicant asserted the three-year Virginia statute of limitations barred the legal 
enforcement of the debt (Tr. 39). Even if he had a valid debt in 2008, he was not going 
to pay the creditor now because of the statute of limitations (Tr. 46-50).6 The reason he 
offered the creditor $200 was to get his security clearance reinstated (Tr. 47). His limit 
to resolve the debt to C is $200, and he meant what he said when he made that offer 
 
5On November 5, 2009, another creditor, N, stated P passed the account to N on August 26, 
2009, for collection, and N returned the account to P (Tr. 44; AE B). N does not provide information to 
credit reporting companies (AE B). Applicant emphasized that a letter from the creditor said the creditor 
had ceased all collection activity (Tr. 22, 25, 37). N’s letter indicated N had “ceased all collection activity” 
because N did not own the debt (AE B). The file does not contain any evidence that P ceased all 
collection activity. 
 
6On March 6, 2009, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that 
his debt to C became delinquent in 2004 due to unemployment (GE 3 at 5). He said no one from C 
contacted Applicant since May 2006. The account was transferred in January 2009; however, Applicant 
has not been contacted by the new debt holder. He emphasized that the statute of limitations expires in 
June 2009. He said that if he is not contacted by the creditor before June 2009, he does not intend to pay 
this debt.

(Tr. 58). He refused to pay more than $200 because he considered a larger payment to 
be an admission that he owed the debt (Tr. 96).7 Applicant has not received any credit 
counseling (Tr. 56).  
   
Applicant did not disclose any unpaid judgments, unpaid liens, garnishments, 
illegal drug use in the last 20 years, alcohol-related offenses, or felonies on his January 
15, 2009, security clearance application. He did not disclose any debts currently 
delinquent over 90 days, or 180 days delinquent in the last seven years.     
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
7The parties agreed that Applicant’s opening statement and closing argument could be 
considered as substantive evidence (Tr. 25, 102).  
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” “It 
is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the 
substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations under [Directive] ¶ 
E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish 
either that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.”

approximately $32,000, became delinquent in May 2006, when it was about $16,000. 
He has not made any payments since June 2006 to the creditor. The government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debt to C. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” Applicant has  
decided that he will not pay more than $200 to resolve his delinquent SOR debt owed to 
C even though he has the means to begin a payment plan and pay substantially more to 
settle this debt.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by 
unemployment, and his spouse’s illness, which caused her to leave the labor force. 
However, he has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that he acted responsibly 
under the circumstances with respect to his unresolved SOR debt. He has been 
employed for the last five years. He resolved his other three credit card accounts in 
2007. He had sufficient income to set up a payment plan for C after paying the other

three credit cards, and he chose not to do so. He has not maintained contact with C or 
with P, the collection company for C.8 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not receive financial 
counseling, he has otherwise learned about financial issues. Applicant cannot receive 
full credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he has not paid, started payment plans, disputed, 
or otherwise resolved his debt to C. There are some initial, positive “indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” He has admitted his responsibility for his 
other credit card debts, and he has resolved them. However, he has decided not to 
make a more substantial settlement offer or to negotiate a payment plan to resolve his 
debt to C.9 He also established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed 
some good faith10 in the resolution of his three large credit card debts by settling and 
payment those debts.  
 
Statute of limitations on credit card debt in Virginia 
 
Virginia Code Ann. §8.01-249(8) provides that the statute of limitations period for 
open accounts begins, “from the later of the last payment or last charge for goods or 
services rendered on the account.” An “open account” includes credit card accounts 
such as Applicant’s account with C. See Carillon Medical Center v. Ady, 77 Va. Cir. 299, 
Va. Cir. LEXIS 162 (2008) (comparing a written contract with a five-year statute of 
limitations with an open account initiated with a written contract). Under Virginia Code 
 
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
9 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Ann. § 8.01-246(4), a legal action must be brought within three years for any unwritten 
contract. An “open account” in Virginia has a three-year statute of limitations.11 Since 
Appellant signed his contract with C more than ten years ago, and his last payment was 
made more than three years ago, C will not be able to obtain a deficiency judgment 
against Applicant if he chooses to oppose the judgment with a statute of limitations 
defense.    
 
  The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and 
judicial value of application of the statute of limitations: 
 
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in 
that they stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by 
giving security and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy 
consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law 
to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of 
limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set 
period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred 
claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on 
their rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial 
system. 
   
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 
(S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence, debts that are beyond the statute of limitations for collections 
cannot be mitigated solely because they are not collectable.12  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his debt to C. He admitted he had an account with C, and that when 
he stopped making payments in June 2006 his account statements showed he owed 
about $16,000 or about $10,000. He provided two account statements from August and 
September 2005 that showed he transferred more than $16,000 in those two months 
alone from his account with C to an account with his bank, BV. After his hearing, he 
questioned the veracity of those payments in 2005 by writing notes on his account 
statements. A reasonably prudent person would have verified the transfers in 2005 or 
2006 by sending letters to C and BV asking for verification of the fund transfers before 
 
11Several internet sites provide helpful information on the statutes of limitations for various 
categories of debts throughout the United States. See, e.g., http://www.fair-debt-collection.com/SOL-by-
State.html#47; http://www.creditinfocenter.com/rebuild/statuteLimitations.shtml; http://www.debtsteps.com/debt-
collection-statute-of-limitations.html.  
 
12The statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant’s legal responsibility to 
pay the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of 
decisions the Appeal Board has rejected the statute of limitations for debts generated through contracts, 
which is the law in all 50 states, as automatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG ¶ 
20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 18, 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008). See also n. 10, supra.

defaulting on his account. He has not met his burden of showing the charges to his 
account with C are not legitimate.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
  Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant is 50 years old, and he is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit 
for serving in the Army and volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an 
employee of a defense contractor. He does not have any unpaid judgments, unpaid 
liens, garnishments, illegal drug use in the last 20 years, alcohol-related offenses, or 
felonies. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the Department 
of Defense, and his employer. He has never been fired from a job or left employment 
under adverse circumstances. His unemployment, and his spouse’s illness and inability 
to work outside their home contributed to his financial woes. He paid three large credit 
card debts, and all of his debts except one are in current status. These factors show 
some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He admitted he owed a large 
debt to C; however, he did not want to pay the charges and interest he owed the 
creditor. He was unsure about his responsibility for some of the charges to his account 
with C. He did not establish and maintain communications with his C, BV, or P about his 
debt. He had ample opportunity to send letters to C and BV and to verify the legitimacy 
of the charges to his account with C. He did not show good faith in the investigation of 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
his responsibility for his debt to C. He had sufficient income after he paid off his other 
credit cards to negotiate a fair settlement with C and make payments. Instead, he 
waited until the statute of limitations barred collection, and then he sent an offer to settle 
a debt of more than $30,000 for $200. This is not a good faith offer to pay a debt. He did 
not make adequate progress in the resolution of his debt to C.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on 
the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful 
consideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of 
the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my 
responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the 
government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
