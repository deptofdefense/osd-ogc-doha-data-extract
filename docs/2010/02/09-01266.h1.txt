Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant received alcohol-related treatment in the early 1990s. In June 2008, the 
police arrested Applicant for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and he 
admitted he was DUI. From July 2008 to September 2008, he received alcohol-related 
treatment. In September 2008, his therapist diagnosed him as alcohol dependent. 
Applicant failed to fully comply with his therapist’s recommendations. Applicant 
minimized his alcohol consumption. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising 
from alcohol consumption. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 23, 
2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended 
and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On July 16, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge (HE 3). On October 1, 2009, Department 
Counsel announced he was ready to proceed on his case. On October 8, 2009, DOHA 
assigned Applicant’s case to me. On November 13, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing 
notice (HE 1). On December 17, 2009, Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. 22-23), and Applicant offered 
two exhibits (Tr. 24; AE A-B). Applicant objected to the content of some therapy notes; 
however, the objection to admissibility was overruled with Applicant’s comments going 
to the weight given the evidence (Tr. 23). Department Counsel did not object to my 
consideration of AE A-B (Tr. 25). I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 23), and AE A-B (Tr. 25). 
Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (HE 1-3). On 
January 4, 2010, I received the transcript. No post-hearing exhibits were received.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a to 1.g, except he changed the year he began consuming alcohol from 1972 to 1977 
(HE 3). He also explained the circumstances of the offenses and provided mitigating 
information (HE 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of 
fact.   
 
 Applicant is 50 years old (Tr. 6).2 In 1997, he received a bachelor of science 
degree in computer information (Tr. 6-7). In 2004, he received a master’s degree in 
business administration (Tr. 6-7). In 1977, he married his spouse (Tr. 7). His two 
children are ages 24 and 28 (Tr. 8). He held a Secret security clearance from 1990 to 
1995 (Tr. 8). Applicant has not served in the military (GE 1).  
 
Alcohol consumption  
 
Applicant consumed alcohol, occasionally to intoxication, from about 1977 to 
August 2008 (Tr. 25; SOR ¶ 1.a—HE 2, 3). He began consuming alcohol when he was 
18 (Tr. 25). In 1979, the police arrested Applicant for illegal possession of alcohol when 
he was 19 (SOR ¶ 1.b—HE 2, 3; GE 4 at 9-10).  
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
2 Applicant’s SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. 
 
 
3 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Applicant said that when he drank alcohol he typically drank about a half pint of 
rum to make him feel relaxed (Tr. 27). He gradually increased the frequency of his 
alcohol consumption from weekends to three or four times a week (Tr. 29). He rarely 
drank alcohol outside of his home (Tr. 29). 
 
Applicant consumed a half pint of alcohol almost every day after work (Tr. 38-39). 
He tried to abstain from alcohol consumption for thirty days and was unable to do so 
(Tr. 36-37). He decided to enroll himself into an outpatient alcohol treatment program 
(Tr. 37). From around 1991 to about 1993, he received alcohol therapy and treatment 
(SOR ¶ 1.c—HE 2, 3). He was diagnosed as an alcoholic (Tr. 40; GE 4 at 9). He 
received six weeks of intensive therapy, and then less-intensive therapy for the next six 
months (Tr. 40). At the conclusion of the therapy program, he thought the diagnosis was 
that he was doing well; however, he was “pretty sure there was a recommendation there 
to continue group” therapy (Tr. 43). Applicant did not continue with group therapy 
because he believed he “had things relatively under control” (Tr. 43). He was able to 
maintain sobriety for about six months (Tr. 44). He repeatedly promised himself that he 
would stop consuming alcohol for years; however, he eventually resumed his alcohol 
consumption (Tr. 44).  
 
Applicant drank alcohol twice to four times per week (Tr. 45). On September 16, 
2007, he had a heart attack and barely survived (Tr. 18, 22; AE B at 1). His doctor 
recommended that he stop his alcohol consumption (Tr. 46-47). Applicant recognized 
that he needed to stop drinking alcohol if he wanted to live (Tr. 18, 22). He also began 
to have greater faith in God (Tr. 19, 22). He informed his employer that he did not want 
to work 70 to 80 hours a week anymore (Tr. 19, 22). He stopped consuming alcohol 
from September 16, 2007, until April 2008 (Tr. 47). 
 
In April 2008, after a contentious meeting with management, Applicant 
purchased some rum and returned to consumption of alcohol after eight months of 
sobriety (Tr. 20, 22, 47-48). He consumed alcohol from April until June 2008 (Tr. 20, 22, 
48). On June 17, 2008, after “another particularly ugly meeting” Applicant resigned from 
his employment (Tr. 20, 22, 48-51; AE B at 1). On June 22, 2008, he drove about 60 
miles to an out-of-state casino, gambled, and drank four rum and cokes (Tr. 51-56).3 On 
his way home the police stopped him for failure to maintain his lane (GE 4 at 5).  He 
failed a field sobriety test (Tr. 80-81). And he refused to consent to a breathalyzer test 
(Tr. 57, 81). The police arrested him for DUI (Tr. 20-22, 51-56; SOR ¶ 1.d—HE 2, 3; GE 
4 at 5).   
 
The court placed Applicant on a 12-month diversion program, which included 
alcohol-related counseling and a victim impact panel. He paid a $635 fine, and his 
driver’s license was revoked for one year (GE 5 at 5). He claimed he was caught for 
DUI the only time he ever drank alcohol and drove (Tr. 39; GE 4 at 9). He said he did 
not go out after consuming alcohol (Tr. 83; GE 4 at 9). Applicant had 12 meetings with 
his counselor from July to September 2008 (Tr. 73; GE 5). On July 1, 2008, his 
counselor, who is a licensed clinical social worker, indicated he was receiving individual 
 
3Applicant also provided a statement indicating he drank “a couple of drinks” (AE B at 2).  
 
4 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
treatment for alcoholism (GE 5 at 1). His counselor recommended that Applicant 
participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and that he take Vivitrol (Tr. 57, 62, 
67-68; GE 5). Applicant did not like attending AA meetings, and declined to participate 
in AA (Tr. 59-60). He did not take Vivitrol even though his counselor said it was better 
than Antabuse (Tr. 62, 67). His personal physician had little knowledge of Vivitrol (Tr. 
62). He chose to engage in church-related counseling, which he received from a friend 
who is not a pastor or church official (Tr. 61). The friend is not a certified counselor (Tr. 
61-62). He completed all of the requirements of his diversion process (Tr. 74).  
 
In July 2008, Applicant’s physician prescribed Antabuse for thirty days for 
Applicant at Applicant’s request (Tr. 63, 65, 68). Applicant took Antabuse for three 
weeks (Tr. 64).4 He stopped taking Antabuse because he felt he did not need it (Tr. 64, 
69).   
 
In August 2008, he drank alcohol twice, and on each occasion he had a couple of 
drinks (Tr. 71-73).5 He has not consumed any alcohol since then (Tr. 21, 22, 73). He 
contended that the heart attack, termination from employment, and the DUI caused him 
to stop his alcohol consumption (Tr. 21, 22). He conceded that he was unable to abide 
by two or three previous promises to abstain from alcohol consumption (Tr. 46).      
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 
September 2008, and that he continued to consume alcohol until at least August 2008 
(HE 2, 3). Applicant admitted the facts in SOR ¶ 1.g (HE 3). Applicant denied 
consuming alcohol after August 2008, and there is no evidence that Applicant 
consumed alcohol after September 2008. 
 
Applicant did not receive any alcohol-related, professional counseling after 
September 2008 (Tr. 84). He has continued to receive counseling from the friend who 
attends his church (Tr. 73, 84).6  He has not consumed alcohol for 16 months (Tr. 77-
78). 
 
July to September 2008 alcohol-treatment notes, diagnosis, and prognosis 
 
From July 2008 to September 2008, Applicant received alcohol treatment and 
counseling (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f—HE 2, 3). His primary physician prescribed Antabuse 
 
4On November 25, 2008, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he took Antabuse for about two 
weeks (GE 4 at 7). 
 
5On November 25, 2008, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he used alcohol twice in August 
2008, but his consumption was “very moderate as far as the amount the subject consumed and the 
subject did not have the desire for more at those times either” (GE 4 at 10). Applicant provided a 
statement at his hearing indicating he “had a drink twice in August 2008” (AE B at 2). Later in that same 
statement, he said he told his counselor that he had a couple of drinks but did not get drunk on the cruise 
(AE B at 3). 
  
6In his closing argument, Applicant mentioned his friend was a former cocaine addict (Tr. 86). I 
decline to draw any adverse inferences about his friend’s qualifications from this disclosure during closing 
arguments because arguments are not evidence.  
 
5 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
for Applicant. He was diagnosed as an alcohol dependent. Applicant’s therapy record 
for July 1, 2008, states he was “drinking heavily” from April 2008 until June 22, 2008 
(GE 5 at 6). “He has had nite (sic) sweats [and] mild tremors. He had been drinking 1 
pint to 1 ½ pints daily since April” (GE 5 at 6).7 The note for September 9, 2008, 
indicates Applicant “got drunk on vacation cruise Aug 8th” (GE 5 at 7). The note for the 
September 26, 2008, session indicates Applicant will find a new counselor when he 
moves to a different state for employment and continue AA (GE 5 at 10). The final 
session was on September 26, 2008 (GE 5 at 12). 
 
Applicant’s counselor diagnosed him as alcohol dependent (AE A). Her 
prognosis for Applicant was excellent (AE A). She recommended that Applicant receive 
a security clearance (AE A). Applicant’s personal physician also indicated Applicant’s 
prognosis was excellent and recommended Applicant for a security clearance (AE A).     
 
As indicated previously, Applicant’s counselor’s notes reflect that on July 1, 2008, 
Applicant told her that he drank a pint and a half of alcohol (Tr. 75). They also indicate 
she recommended he attend AA meetings (Tr. 75). Applicant denied that he ever told 
her he consumed alcohol to that level (Tr. 75). He insisted that he did not drink more 
than a half pint of rum (AE B at 2). He denied that he was a “heavy drinker” (Tr. 75). He 
denied that he got drunk on the cruise, and said he only had “a couple of drinks” (AE B 
at 2). Applicant said he told his counselor about his friend, the counselor at his church 
(Tr. 75; AE B). He contends she agreed that this counseling was sufficient in lieu of 
professional counseling and AA meetings (Tr. 75; AE B). Applicant’s counselor said 
Applicant had tremors, and Applicant denied that he did (Tr. 76; AE B at 2). He said he 
had trouble sleeping since his heart attack (AE B at 2). 
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
 
7On November 25, 2008, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, 
that after April 2008, “the frequency to which he drank corresponded with the stress at work, but when he 
did drink, it was moderately and not in excess and not to intoxication—maybe 1-2 drinks to help the 
subject relax” (GE 4 at 7). 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
administrative judge’s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with respect to the allegations set 
forth in the SOR.

Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) - 22(g) 
provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b), 22(d), 22(f), and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not consume 
alcohol at work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. His alcohol consumption 
problem was not diagnosed or evaluated “by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., 
physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist).” Although he received some alcohol 
treatment in the early 1990s, there is no clear evidence of a diagnosis of alcohol abuse 
or dependence. The file does not contain any records from that treatment. Applicant’s 
SOR response is ambiguous about the diagnosis (he describes the diagnosis as 
 
8 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
potential alcohol abuse). There is a relapse after his treatment in the early 1990s. 
Applicant has not failed to comply with a court order not to consume alcohol. 
 
Applicant had one alcohol-related incident involving police intervention or arrest. 
His DUI arrest was in June 2008. AG ¶ 22(a) applies. Applicant occasionally consumed 
a pint and a half of alcohol. This constitutes binge consumption of alcohol. AG ¶ 22(c) 
applies. A licensed clinical social worker diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent. AG 
¶ 22(e) applies. 
 
  “Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, 
there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 
F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden 
concerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant 
to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
  Four Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 23 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
AG ¶ 23(a) does not fully apply. Applicant had a DUI in June 2008. He most 
recently drank to intoxication in August 2008. He described his current alcohol 
consumption in his SOR response and at his hearing. However, the most accurate 
description of his alcohol consumption was provided in the alcohol-treatment notes of 
 
9 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
his counselor.8 Although his alcohol-related incident, a DUI, is relatively recent, it is a 
single incident and therefore infrequent. Applicant understated his alcohol consumption. 
Without credible evidence of his current rate of alcohol consumption the likelihood of 
recurrence of alcohol-related offenses cannot be sufficiently assessed to mitigate fully 
security concerns.  
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial 
alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a 
fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.9  
 
AG ¶¶ 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not fully acknowledge or 
completely describe his history of alcohol consumption. He did not provide a thorough 
and accurate description of his current alcohol consumption. A licensed clinical social 
worker diagnosed Applicant as being alcohol dependent in September 2008. He made 
statements that were inconsistent with his treatment records. A clearer and more 
forthright description of his past alcohol use would have helped to erase lingering 
concerns. I am convinced he is minimizing his alcohol consumption problem, refusing to 
fully acknowledge the extent of his alcohol consumption problem. Statements from 
colleagues, friends, or family members about his alcohol consumption would have been 
helpful. Applicant has completed an alcohol treatment or counseling program. He 
received a positive prognosis; however, he did not continue his counseling with a 
certified, professional counselor. He did not continue to attend Alcoholic Anonymous 
meetings. His history of alcohol problems and his failure to continue with any credible, 
certified, professional, or AA rehabilitation programs precludes providing full mitigating 
credit under AG ¶ 23.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g allege that Applicant was prescribed Antabuse by his 
physician, and he continued to consume alcohol after being diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent. Applicant’s last established consumption of alcohol was in August 2008. 
Sometime in the July to September 2008 period, he was diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent. His use of Antabuse is a mitigating circumstance. Accordingly, I find for 
Applicant at page 12, infra, with respect to SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g.   
  
Applicant’s statement about abstaining from alcohol consumption after August 
2008 is a positive development, showing that he recognizes the importance of 
overcoming his alcohol problems. However, after careful consideration of the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption,10 I conclude his single DUI in June 
 
8See Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) and commentary explaining why statements made to 
obtain medical treatment are deemed reliable.

(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   
 
10For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant continued to drink 
even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge’s application of MC 3.”  In ISCR Case No.

2008, his failure to be honest and forthright about his previous alcohol consumption, 
and the absence of detailed corroborating information about his current alcohol 
consumption weigh against mitigating alcohol consumption concerns.  
   
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline G in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although there is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance, 
the mitigation evidence is insufficient to resolve security concerns. Applicant knows the 
consequences of excessive alcohol consumption. He has had only one alcohol-related 
offense involving the police and the courts, a DUI in June 2008. He completed an 
alcohol-therapy program in the early 1990s and in September 2008, and received an 
excellent prognosis from his counselor and personal physician. Applicant contributes to 
his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at work of any other 
disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty, or that he would intentionally 
violate national security. His character and good work performance show some 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he 
would not have been able to retain his employment after his security clearance was 
called into question.   
 
 
05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a 
clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most 
recent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to 
intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued alcohol consumption was 
not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 
04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three 
years before hearing, and reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
11 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial.  
Applicant had a problem with alcohol use beginning in 1977, when he was a minor. He 
continued to consume alcohol at times to excess, with some periods of abstinence, until 
August 2008. He received intensive alcohol therapy in the early 1990s; however, he had 
a relapse and returned to alcohol consumption a few months after completing this 
program. He had a DUI in June 2008. He declined a breath-alcohol test and there is no 
evidence to corroborate his contention that he only had four or “a couple” of drinks 
before driving. He told his therapist that he drinks a pint to a pint and a half of alcohol 
and that he got drunk in August 2008 on a cruise. She described tremors, which she 
related to his alcohol consumption. She recommended Applicant attend AA meetings 
and continue therapy or counseling.  
 
Applicant denied that he told his therapist that he consumed up to a pint and a 
half of alcohol, and repeatedly said he stops consuming alcohol when he consumes a 
half pint of rum. In August 2008, he claimed he only had one drink or a couple of drinks 
and did not get drunk (Tr. 71-73; AE B). He told an OPM investigator that his alcohol 
consumption on the cruise in August 2008 was “very moderate” (GE 4 at 10). However, 
I find the therapist’s notes to be more credible than Applicant’s statements, which 
conflict with the contents of the therapy notes. I specifically find he told his counselor 
that he got drunk on the cruise. Applicant said the only time he ever drove after drinking 
alcohol resulted in his DUI arrest and conviction (Tr. 39; GE 4 at 9). I am convinced 
Applicant is minimizing his alcohol consumption. He stated the last time he consumed 
alcohol was in August 2008. He did not provide any corroboration from friends and 
family of his contention of alcohol abstinence. Although he received an excellent 
prognosis from his therapist and personal physician, they may not be aware that he did 
not attend AA or receive ongoing therapy or counseling from a professional, certified 
counselor after September 2008. They may not be aware that he contested the 
information in his therapy notes about the degree of his alcohol consumption and was 
minimizing his alcohol consumption. As such their opinions about his prognosis are 
discounted. Applicant’s failure to be candid and forthcoming about his alcohol 
consumption at his hearing shows a lack of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
 
I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to alcohol 
consumption. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”11 
and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
