Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant mitigated the security concern caused by her marijuana use, which last
occurred in or about August 2008. Clearance is granted. 
On September 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline H (drug involvement). Applicant’s
response to the SOR was received by DOHA on November 2, 2009. She denied the
allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.a, admitted the allegation contained in SOR
subparagraph 1.b, and she requested a decision based on the record without a hearing.
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 23,
2009, which was mailed to Applicant on November 24, 2009. Applicant was notified she

had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit her objections thereto or any additional
information she wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on
December 3, 2009. She submitted a written response to the FORM with five attachments.
On January 7, 2010, Department Counsel indicated she did not object to the admissibility
of the material submitted by Applicant. The case was assigned to me on January 20, 2010.
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admission to the one SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 26-year-old single woman who has been employed as a legal
associate by a defense contractor since November 2008. She graduated from high school
in May 2002, and she attended college from August 2002 until May 2006. She did not
receive a college degree, but she resumed part-time remote attendance at the same
college in 2009. 
Applicant worked as a desk clerk at a hotel from June 2006 until September 2006,
and as a sales associate in a retail store from December 2006 until October 2008. She was
unemployed from October 2006 until December 2006, and again from October 2008 until
November 2008.
Applicant’s project manager/team leader with her current employer attests that
Applicant is an integral part of his team who has proven herself to be a dependable,
trustworthy, and excellent worker. A family friend who is an intelligence analyst for a U. S.
Government agency considers Applicant a dependable, honest, and trustworthy individual.
Both of these individual’s believe Applicant can be trusted to safeguard classified
information if she is granted a security clearance. 
     
On December 12, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions
(SF 86), in which she admitted using marijuana about 50 times between October 2004 and
May 2006, and 25 more times between February 2007 and August 2008. She was
questioned about her use of marijuana on January 7, 2009, and she again acknowledged
that she had used marijuana as she stated in the SF 86. When questioned, she elaborated
that she used marijuana about 50 times from 2004 to 2006 with friends at parties while she
was a college student. She also stated she purchased marijuana in 2007 and 2008 from
a coworker while she was employed as a sales clerk, and she used it about 25 times at
home to reduce stress. 
Applicant does not live in the same area where she attended college and she no
longer associates with the people she used marijuana with while she was in college. She
also does not associate with the person she purchased marijuana from while she worked
as a sales clerk. Applicant has not used marijuana since August 2008. She does not intend
to use marijuana in the future, and, on January 4, 2010, she executed and submitted a
statement expressing that intent and agreeing to the automatic revocation of any security
clearance she may be granted if she abuses any controlled substance in the future.

Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1
through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition
or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.
Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines H (drug involvement), with its
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of5
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant6
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11

Analysis
Guideline H, Drug Involvement
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and
because it raises questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws,
rules, and regulations.
Applicant illegally purchased and used marijuana about 75 times between October
2004 and August 2008. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 25(a): any drug abuse; and DC
25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale, or distribution apply.
Applicant began using marijuana at a young age while attending parties with college
friends. She purchased and used marijuana while she worked as a sales clerk in a retail
store. Applicant last used marijuana in or about August 2008. Before she began working
for a defense contractor in November 2008, she committed to abstaining from future
marijuana use. Since making that decision, she has proven herself to be an excellent
worker and she has earned a reputation as a dependable, honest, and trustworthy
individual. She no longer associates with the people with whom she formerly used
marijuana, and she has executed and submitted a declaration that she will not abuse
controlled substances in the future with an agreement to the automatic revocation of her
security clearance if she does abuse a controlled substance.    
The following Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply in this case: MC 26(a): the behavior
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it
is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any
drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate
period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of
clearance for any violation.
 
I have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this
case, including Applicant’s relatively young age when she used and purchased marijuana,
the period of time that has elapsed since her last use of marijuana, the letters of
recommendation she submitted, her consent to an automatic revocation of her security
clearance if she abuses a controlled substance in the future, the whole person concept,
the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying
and mitigating conditions. Applicant has mitigated the security concern caused by her
abuse of marijuana. She has overcome the case against her and satisfied her ultimate
burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a
security clearance.

Conclusion

Clearance is granted.
