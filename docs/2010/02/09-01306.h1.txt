Decision
______________
CEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:
The Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP), on October 17, 2008.  On June 18, 2009, the Defense Office of
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the
security concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended
(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs
issued after September 1, 2006. 
The Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 3, 2009.  He answered
the SOR in writing on July 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an Administrative
Judge.  DOHA received the request on July 13, 2009, and I received the case
assignment on July 31, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 12, 2009,
and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 15, 2009.  The Government
2
offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 9, which were received without objection.  The
Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did his Supervisor, and submitted Exhibits
(AppXs) A and B, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR)
on September 23, 2009.  I granted the Applicant’s request to keep the record open until
October 13, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On October 13, 2009, he submitted
Exhibits C through L, without objection.  As the undersigned had jury duty on October
13 and 14, 2009, the record closed on October 15, 2009.  Based upon a review of the
case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
Findings of Fact
In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in all of
the allegations of SOR, with explanations.
The Applicant is retired from the Navy, and during his periods of deployment, his
former spouse was tasked with handling their bills (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 31 line
8, at page 75 line 24 to page 76 line 10, and at page 88 lines 12~23).  For the most
part, she did not pay their debts in a timely fashion, but rather gambled away much of
their income (Id).  During their two year period of a legal separation, pending their
divorce in November of 2003, unbeknownst to the Applicant, she continued to run up
bills and acquire new debt in the Applicant’s name (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 31 line
8, at page 75 line 24 to page 76 line 10, and at page 88 lines 12~23, and GX 1 at page
18).  This conduct resulted in the Applicant’s current financial difficulties.
1.z.  In May of 2000, the Applicant’s debts were discharged as a result of a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy (TR at page 48 line 6~8, at page 29 line 11 to page 30 line 14,
and GX 9).  Subsequent to this bankruptcy, however, further past due indebtedness
was incurred.
1.a.  This debt is to Creditor A in the amount of about $147.  The Applicant has
paid this debt, as evidenced by the most recent September 2009 credit report (CR) (TR
at page 32 lines 11~20, at page 34 lines 9~22, and AppX A at page 19).
1.b.  This debt is to Creditor B in the amount of about $512.  The Applicant has
also paid this debt, as evidenced by the most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page
34 line 23 to page 35 line 7, and AppX A at page 18).
1.c.  This debt is to Creditor C in the amount of about $451.  The Applicant
successfully disputed this debt as having been satisfied; and as such, it does not
appear on his most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 35 line 8 to page 36 line
14, at page 80 line 4 to page 81 line 23, and AppX A).
1.d.  This debt is to Creditor D in the amount of about $790.  The Applicant has
“paid” this debt, as evidenced by correspondence from the successor creditor to this
debt (TR at page 36 line 14 to page 37 line 3, and AppX D).
3
1.e.  This debt is to Creditor E in the amount of about $1,039.  This medical bill
has been “withdrawn” by the creditor, as it was paid by the Applicant’s secondary
insurance carrier, as evidenced by correspondence from the creditor (TR at page 37
lines 5~13, at page 69 line 18 to page 71 line 24, and AppX E).
1.f.  This debt is to Creditor F in the amount of about $223.  This medical bill has
also been “withdrawn” by the creditor, as it was paid by the Applicant’s secondary
insurance carrier, as evidenced by correspondence from the creditor (TR at page 37
line 15 to page 38 line17, at page 81 line 24 to page 83 line 12, and AppX F).
1.g.  This debt is to Creditor G in the amount of about $411.  The Applicant has
paid this debt, as evidenced by the most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 38
line 18 to page 39 line 4, at page 72 line 1 to page 74 line 3, and AppX A at pages
19~20).
1.h.  This debt is to Creditor H in the amount of about $53.  The Applicant
successfully disputed this debt as having been satisfied; and as such, it does not
appear on his most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 39 lines 5~16, and AppX
A).
1.i.  This debt is to Creditor I in the amount of about $877.  The Applicant has
“paid in full” this debt, as evidenced by correspondence from the creditor (TR at page 39
line 17 to page 40 line 4, at page 76 line 11 to page 77 line 8, and AppX G).
1.j.  This debt is to Creditor J in the amount of about $166.  The Applicant has
paid this debt, as evidenced by a most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 40 lines
9~19, and AppX A at page 14).
1.k.  This debt is to Creditor K in the amount of about $964.  The Applicant
successfully disputed this debt as having been satisfied; and as such, it does not
appear on his most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 40 line 20 to page 41 line
21, at page 83 lines 12~23, and AppX A).
1.l.  This debt is to Creditor L in the amount of about $6,531.  The Applicant has
begun to make monthly payments of $500 towards this debt, as evidenced by the most
recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 41 line 24 to page 43 line 5, at page 66 line 11
to page 69 line 17, and AppX A at page 16).
1.m.  This debt is to Creditor M in the amount of about $593.  The Applicant has
“paid in full” this debt, as evidenced by correspondence from the creditor (TR at page 43
lines 6~13, and AppX H).
1.n.  This debt is to Creditor N in the amount of about $438.  The Applicant
successfully disputed this debt; and as such, it does not appear on his most recent
September 2009 CR (TR at page 43 line 15 to page 44 line 6, at page 83 line 24 to
page 84 line 10, and AppX A).
4
1.o.  This debt is to Creditor O in the amount of about $117.  The Applicant has
paid this debt, as evidenced by the most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 44
lines 7~18, at page 84 line 11 to page 85 line 2, and AppX A at page 12).
1.p., 1.q., and 1.r.  These debts are to Creditor P in an amount totaling about
$296.  The Applicant has paid these water bills of his former spouse; and as such, they
do not appear on his most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 44 line 19 to page
45 line 9, and AppX A).
1.s.  This debt is to Creditor S in the amount of about $65.  The Applicant has
paid this debt, as evidenced by correspondence from a credit reporting service (TR at
page 45 lines 7~14, at page 50 lines 13~17, and AppX I).
1.t.  This debt is to Creditor T in the amount of about $615.  The Applicant
disputes this debt as not being his, and avers credibly that, in speaking with the creditor,
they have no record of this debt (TR at page 45 line 15 to page 46 line 13, at page 77
line 10 to page 79 line 24).  The Appellant’s credibility is attested to by his Supervisor
(TR at page 22 line 14 to page 25 line 12).
1.u. and 1.v.  These debts are to Creditor U in an amount totaling about $557.
These medical bills have been “removed” from the Appellant’s most recent CR, as they
were paid by the Applicant’s secondary insurance carrier, as evidenced by that
September 2009 CR (TR at page 48 line 21 to page 49 line 25, at page 85 line 3 to
page 86 line 15, and AppX A at pages 16 and 17).

September 2009 CR (TR at page 48 lines 9~20, and AppX A).
1.x.  This debt is to Creditor X in the amount of about $1,712.  The Applicant
successfully disputed this debt; and as such, it does not appear on his most recent
September 2009 CR (TR at page 46 line 14 to page 47 line 2, at page 86 line 16 to
page 87 line 10, and AppX A).
1.y.  This debt is to Creditor Y in the amount of about $1,091.  The Applicant has
paid this debt, which is listed as current and closed with a “0" balance, as evidenced by
the most recent September 2009 CR (TR at page 47 lines 14~23, and AppX A at page
5).
Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
5
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge’s over-arching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to
Paragraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables
known as the “whole person concept.”  The administrative judge must consider all
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and
unfavorable, in making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.
Paragraph 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  In
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical
and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to
establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,
the Applicant is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department
Counsel. . . .”  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a
favorable security decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration
of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
classified information.
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the
applicant concerned.”  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).
Analysis
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set
out in Paragraph 18:
6
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,
or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information.  An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate
funds. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under
Subparagraph 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially
disqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial
obligations@ may raise security concerns.  During his marriage, and during his legal
separation from his, now, former spouse, the Applicant was saddled with her delinquent
debts.
These are clearly countered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs
20(b) and 20 (d).  Under Subparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where “the conditions
that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., . . .
divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@
Furthermore, Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@  The
Appellant’s former spouse would rather gamble than pay their debts; and as a result, he
became responsible for the past due indebtedness.  The Applicant, with little help from
his former spouse, has made a good faith effort to address all of the alleged past due
debts.  In fact, he has paid, or resolved, all of the alleged past due debts.
Whole Person Concept
Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s
conduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of
whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense
judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person
concept.  Here, he has the unqualified support of his Supervisor, and of his Team Lead
(TR at page 22 line 14 to page 25 line 12, and AppX B).
The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
7
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
I considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and
mitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me
without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security
clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns
arising from his financial considerations.

clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
