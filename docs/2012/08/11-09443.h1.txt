Decision

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations concern. Although his 
financial situation is, in part, due to matters beyond his control, he failed to act 
responsibly under the circumstances. He failed to demonstrate that his long track record 
of financial irresponsibility is no longer a concern. Clearance is denied. 
 
Procedural History 
 
On May 9, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), setting out security concerns under Guideline 
F (Financial Considerations).1 On May 16, 2012, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.

 DOHA took this action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

 On June 27, 2012, Department Counsel indicated the Government was ready to 
proceed with a hearing. I was assigned the case on July 2, 2012 and, after coordinating 
with the parties, scheduled the hearing for July 24, 2012. At hearing, Department 
Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without 
objection. Applicant appeared at the hearing, testified, and offered Applicant’s Exhibits 
(AE) A through C. These documents were also admitted without objection. The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on August 1, 2012.2 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is in his fifties. He received his undergraduate degree in electrical 
engineering in 1984. His stepson died in 2000 and he recently divorced after 18 years of 
marriage. He currently lives with his father and is thrifty with his money, generally 
shopping at Goodwill or the 80% discount rack at a local department store. He provided 
information regarding his charitable endeavors. His family, friends, and coworkers wrote 
letters attesting to his reliability and trustworthiness.3  
 
Applicant started his own internet business in 1997 and it was successful until 
2004. He sold the business to his brother and went into real estate for the next three 
years. His income decreased sharply from around $60,000 to approximately $20,000 to 
30,000 per year.4 In March 2007, Applicant was able to land a job as a software 
developer at a yearly salary of approximately $95,000. In October 2008, Applicant 
voluntarily decided to accept an offer from a small business to become its firmware 
developer at the same yearly salary of $95,000. Five months later, in March 2009, 
Applicant quit his new job because he had not been paid his salary in approximately six 
weeks. Applicant was unemployed for the next two months. He was able to secure work 
as a tutor, which only paid him around $12 to $15 per hour. He supplemented his 
income as a tutor with other part-time work. His income from 2009 to 2011 was between 
$15,000 and $20,000. Applicant started working for his current employer in April 2012, 
at an annual salary of $105,000.5 
 
 Applicant submitted his security clearance application in March 2011. He 
disclosed that he had financial issues, to include:  (1) a $18,000 federal tax debt due to 
his failure to file his tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2009, (2) over $2,000 in state

 At hearing, Applicant raised for the first time that he had not received his investigative file. I 
offered him the opportunity to keep the record open, in order to allow him time to receive the file and 
submit additional matters for my review. Applicant declined the offer and asked that I close the record at 
the conclusion of the hearing. (Tr. at 16-21, 121, 136)

tax liens, and (3) two delinquent credit card accounts with a combined balance of over 
$37,500. Applicant stated he was in the process of settling the outstanding federal tax 
debt and the larger of the two delinquent credit card debts. He promised to resolve all 
his outstanding debt once he was back on his feet financially.6 He noted that the reason 
for his failure to pay his financial obligations on time was due to his unsteady 
employment history. He specifically stated that he had “kept in touch” with the creditor 
for “the biggest credit card debt and they have offered to settle for 10 cents on the 
dollar” – the balance owed on this credit card account exceeded $28,500.7 
 
 Applicant settled his $18,000 federal tax debt for $1,000. He satisfied the federal 
tax debt in September 2011. As part of the settlement agreement with the IRS, 
Applicant is required to file and pay his taxes in a timely fashion for five years. Applicant 
explained that he failed to file his federal tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2009 
because in about 2002 he fired his accountant in an attempt to cut back on business 
expenses and his computer, which contained tax information regarding his former 
business, malfunctioned. Applicant testified that he filed his 2011 tax return on time.8 
 
 In approximately March or April 2012, Applicant received a substantial monetary 
judgment as a result of a civil claim he filed against his former employer who had 
refused to pay him his wages. He used the money to settle and satisfy his remaining 
delinquent debts. He satisfied the state tax liens in April 2012. The liens were for unpaid 
taxes from 2005 to 2007.9 Applicant admits that he was in part motivated to satisfy the 
state tax liens because of the inquiries from DOHA regarding their status.10 Applicant 
testified that the state tax liens were related to his failed business. He previously told an 
investigator he had sold the business to his brother in 2004.11 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.c) 
 
 Applicant also used the proceeds from the monetary judgment to settle and 
satisfy the two credit card accounts that were in collection and together totaled over 
$37,500. Applicant settled the lesser of the two credit card accounts for $6,000. (SOR ¶ 
1.d) He settled and satisfied the delinquent credit card account with a balance of over

$28,500 for less than $3,500. (SOR ¶ 1.e) Applicant settled these debts, which had 
been delinquent since about 2005, two weeks before the hearing.12 At hearing, 
Applicant claimed that he had previously satisfied both these debts in 2007 but, since 
he did not have documentation to prove he had paid the debts, he went ahead and paid 
them again to satisfy the Government’s concerns.13 He did not contest the validity of the 
credit card debt for over $28,500. He previously admitted in his SCA that he owed this 
debt and claimed that he had “kept in touch” with the creditor, having received an offer 
to settle the balance owed for less than 10% prior to submitting his SCA in 2011.14  
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.  
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.  
 
The Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. On the other hand, an applicant is responsible for 
presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts 
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
In resolving this ultimate question, an administrative judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt 
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information . . . in favor 
of national security.” AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it

 GE 5 at 9-11; AE B; Tr. at 28-46, 59-60 (Applicant explained that two separate collection 
agencies claimed that they were the rightful owner of the debt alleged in 1.d. He paid $3,000 to each of 
the agencies and promised to pay the rightful owner the remaining $3,000 after the hearing. He would 
then await a refund from the other collection agency).

grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to financial problems is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
“This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of his or her 
debts.”15 The concern also encompasses financial irresponsibility, which may indicate 
that an applicant would also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in 
handling and safeguarding classified information.  
 
Applicant accumulated a significant amount of debt after his business failed in 
2004 and his income dropped to half of what he was previously earning. However, he 
was gainfully employed from March 2007 to at least December 2008 and he did not 
address his delinquent state tax debt or credit cards. He only addressed the state tax 
liens after DOHA inquired as to their status and settled the substantial credit card debt, 
which had been delinquent since at least 2005, shortly before the hearing. This history 
of financial irresponsibility raises the financial considerations concern and establishes 
the following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations.

 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). See also ISCR Case No. 10-00925 at 2 
(App. Bd. June 26, 2012) (The Guideline F concern “is broader than a concern that an applicant might 
commit criminal acts in order to pay off his debts. Rather, Guideline F requires a judge to consider the 
totality of an applicant’s circumstances–the reasons underlying his financial problems and his efforts to 
address them–in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the applicant possesses the judgment and 
self-control required of those who have access to national security information.”)

 However, an applicant’s past or current indebtedness is not the end of the 
analysis under Guideline F, because “[a] security clearance adjudication is not a 
proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant’s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.”16 Accordingly, 
Applicant may mitigate the financial considerations concern by establishing one or more 
of the mitigating conditions listed under AG ¶ 20. The relevant mitigating conditions are: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant’s financial situation was, in part, due to matters beyond his control, 
namely, two significant periods of unemployment and underemployment.17 However, 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully applicable because, as explained above, Applicant did not 
address his delinquent debts in a responsible fashion when he had the means to do 
so.18  
 
 Applicant failed to establish the applicability of the other mitigating conditions 
under AG ¶ 20. Although he has slashed his living expenses and now lives within his 
means, his long history of financial irresponsibility and less than candid explanations 
regarding his finances leaves me with significant doubts regarding his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Specifically, in assessing Applicant’s case in 
mitigation, I considered his failure to file his federal tax returns for tax years 2002 to

(App. Bd. May 9, 2011). 
 
17
 Applicant also claimed that his stepson’s death and unreimbursed medical expenses 
contributed to his financial situation. However, he did not establish that the SOR debts were related to 
these matters. ISCR Case 07-09304 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008) (applicant bears the burden of 
establishing nexus between matter outside of their control and inability to pay their debts).

2009.19 His testimony that he did not file his tax returns for the entire period because a 
computer malfunctioned in 2002, which contained tax information related to his former 
business, was uncorroborated and does not adequately explain his failure to address 
his federal tax issues for several years, including well after he had sold his business. 
Applicant did resolve his federal tax debt before the SOR was issued, but settled it for 
less than ten percent of what he owed the Government. He is now in a five-year 
probationary type period where he is required to file and pay his federal taxes on time – 
a legal obligation of all citizens that Applicant deliberately failed to abide by for a lengthy 
period of time. Applicant’s lengthy history of failing to timely file his tax returns and pay 
his taxes raises serious concerns as to whether he would comply with Government 
rules and regulations regarding the proper handling and protection of classified 
information. His timely filing of one tax return and recent satisfaction of the SOR debts, 
does not amount to a consistent track record of responsible financial conduct. 
Applicant’s long track record of financial irresponsibility leaves me with doubts regarding 
his suitability for access to classified information.  
 
 In addition, Applicant’s testimony that the tax liens for unpaid state taxes from 
2005 to 2007 were related to his former business, which he previously reported he had 
sold in 2004, appears to be, at best, misleading.20 His testimony that he had previously 
satisfied the credit card debt with a balance of over $28,500 and then paid it again, 
without contesting its validity, is implausible for it beguiles common sense that someone 
in Applicant’s shoes would not, at a minimum, raise some objection to having to pay 
such a substantial debt for a second time. Based on the evidence, I find that Applicant 
only satisfied the debts at issue in order to get a clearance, not out of any true sense of 
obligation to pay his just debts. Applicant’s less than forthright explanation regarding his 
finances and lack of true financial reform raise significant doubt regarding the extent to 
which his finances are under control and cast further doubt as to his reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment.21  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).22 I gave due consideration to all the favorable and 
                                                          
19
 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 2-3 (proper for a judge to consider tax debts, which are not alleged 
in an SOR, in assessing an applicant’s case in mitigation).  
 
20
 ISCR Case 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. July 30, 2008) (an applicant is expected to present 
documentation to substantiate his or her claim about the debts at issue). 
 
21
 ISCR Case No. 10-08650 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2011) (proper to consider an applicant’s 
inconsistent and implausible statements regarding his or her debts in assessing an applicant’s credibility 
and whether they met their burden of persuasion as to mitigation under Guideline F). 
 
22
 The non-exhaustive list of factors are:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent 
 
8 
 
 
extenuating factors in this case, including Applicant’s good works and favorable 
character references. However, this favorable evidence, as well as the other mitigating 
record evidence, does not outweigh the security concerns at issue. Security clearance 
adjudications are by their very nature predictive judgments, where an applicant’s past 
history is the best indicator of future conduct. Applicant’s lengthy history of financial 
irresponsibility continues to raise doubts as to his suitability. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings regarding the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):       AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:               Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence and for the foregoing reasons, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. 
Accordingly, Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.
