GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 9, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on August 23, 2011.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him a 
set of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on August 23, 2011.3 On 
another unspecified date, DOHA issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to

those interrogatories on December 30, 2011.4 On March 30, 2012, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), and detailed 
reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 11, 2012. In a notarized 
statement, dated April 25, 2012,5 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on May 15, 2012, and the case was assigned to 
me on May 18, 2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 6, 2012, and I convened 
the hearing as scheduled, on July 11, 2012.  
 
 During the hearing, 8 Government exhibits (GE 1-8) and 14 Applicant exhibits 
(AE A-N) were admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant and one other 
witness testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on July 20, 2012. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity, and subsequently submitted a number of documents which were collated 
into 15 groups and admitted into evidence as Applicant exhibits (AE O-AC), without 
objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., 1.f. through 1.g., 
1.i., 1.j., and 1.m. through 1.r.). He denied the remaining factual allegations. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a 
principal engineer,6 and he is seeking to retain the secret security clearance that was 
previously awarded to him in 2003.7 While he attended a university extension program

overseas from 1995 until 2002,8 it is unclear if he ever obtained a degree.9 Applicant 
served honorably on active duty with the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in an 
enlisted capacity from 1978 until 1982.10 The record is silent regarding Applicant’s 
employment status or activities from 1982 until 1984. He was employed as a field 
engineer from 1984 until 2003, before joining his current employer in 2003.11 Applicant 
was married to his first wife in 1975, and divorced in 1984.12 He married his second wife 
in 1984, they separated in early 2008, and divorced in 2012.13 He and his second wife 
have three daughters, born in 1986, 1988, and 1990.14  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about January 2008 
when he first started having financial problems, and began falling behind on his various 
payments.15 He attributed it to several factors: his second wife’s emotional instability 
and refusal to stop engaging in pyramid scams;16 her opening credit accounts and then 
ignoring the unpaid balances; extending themselves beyond their means;17 maintaining 
an expensive temporary residence across the country for one year to make his job 
easier;18 and their separation with the associated extra costs of maintaining two 
residences, including spousal support.19 As to her emotional instability, Applicant’s wife 
routinely sent money to individuals in Jamaica in the erroneous belief that she had won 
a lottery and had to send money in order to collect her winnings.20 He repeatedly tried to

during the hearing, Applicant indicated that he and his second wife had separated in early 2009. See GE 2 (Personal 
Subject Interview, dated October 25, 2010), at 1; Tr. at 41-42. However, in his answers to interrogatories, he claimed

have her stop doing so, but she rejected his entreaties.21 With the loss of her income, 
and as a result of his delayed payments to creditors, in late 2009, accounts became 
delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off.22 One account went to 
judgment.  
 
Applicant’s financial situation rapidly turned bleak. In 2009, after trying 
unsuccessfully to voluntarily relinquish his inoperable automobile because he could no 
longer afford to make payments on three vehicles and on his second mortgage, the 
automobile was repossessed.23 In 2010, because his ex-wife failed to pay the mortgage 
on the house in which she had remained, the bank foreclosed on the mortgage.24 In 
2010, his wages were garnished by a creditor in the amount of $350 per month to 
satisfy a delinquent credit card.25 Applicant’s ex-wife continued opening accounts in his 
name without his knowledge or permission, and those accounts eventually became 
delinquent.26 In late 2010, Applicant started contacting his creditors in an effort to 
resolve his accounts. He resolved some accounts and commenced payments on 
others.27  
 
In August 2011, nearly six months before the SOR was issued, Applicant 
enrolled in a free credit counseling program which furnished financial counseling, 
budget development, and debt elimination guidance.28 He enrolled in their debt 
management plan; establishing a budget and action plan, and identifying his creditors 
with a projected payment rate.29 About three months before the hearing, Applicant 
obtained a $3,000 salary advance to resolve some delinquent consumer debt.30 
Although Applicant’s employer offers free financial counseling,31 he was too proud to 
seek such assistance, but not too proud to ask for the advance.32

The SOR identified 18 purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $56,266. Each account is described below, reflecting both the original 
and present status, as follows: 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a bank credit card account with a high credit of $10,468 that 
was past due in the amount of $1,792, with an unpaid balance of $10,093.33 The 
account was charged off in September 2009.34 In June 2010, the creditor obtained a 
judgment in the amount of $10,268.35 By garnishing Applicant’s wages, the creditor 
started receiving monthly payments of $349 in September 2010, and by June 2012, the 
unpaid remaining balance had been reduced to $3,170.36 The account is in the process 
of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is an automobile loan account with a high credit of $20,445 
that became delinquent, and after the vehicle was repossessed, the unpaid balance of 
$11,652 was charged off.37 The vehicle was sold by the creditor for $1,400.38 In late 
2011, Applicant contacted the creditor’s attorney in an effort to resolve the account, and 
in January 2012, the creditor agreed to a repayment plan. Under that plan, Applicant 
made monthly payments of $150 until April 2012, at which time the payments increased 
to $300 per month.39 By June 12, 2012, because of court costs and interest, despite 
Applicant’s payments, the unpaid balance had increased to $14,559.40 The account is in 
the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a joint motorcycle loan account with a credit limit of $6,500 
that became delinquent, and $4,133 was charged off in September 2010.41 Although 
Applicant initially contended to the OPM investigator that he reached an agreement with 
the creditor to make four payments each of $650 per month beginning in October 
2010,42 he was unable to meet that obligation and it was terminated. In August 2011, 
Applicant and the collection agent for the creditor agreed to monthly payments of $161

to commence that month.43  Applicant has made his monthly payments, and as of July 
5, 2012, the remaining unpaid balance has been reduced to $1,957.44 The account is in 
the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a telephone account with a past-due balance of $793 that 
was charged off and sold to a collection agent.45 Applicant claimed it belonged to his ex-
wife and he was unaware of the account as the bills were sent to her.46 It is unclear 
what motivated him to settle the account and start making payments, but in April 2012, 
the account was settled for $476.47 Applicant made his first monthly payment of $238 in 
May 2012.48 He made his final payment in July 2012, and the account now has a zero 
balance.49 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is another telephone account with a past-due balance of $468 
that was charged off and sold to a collection agent.50 Applicant was initially unaware of 
the account and claimed it belonged to his ex-wife.51 It is unclear what motivated him to 
settle the account in January 2012, and start making payments, but the account was 
settled in full for $132.52 Applicant made his final monthly payment of $66 in February 
2012,53 and the account now has a zero balance.54 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is an employee credit union credit card account with a credit 
limit of $5,000, a high credit of $5,423, and an unpaid balance of $3,248, that was past 
due in the amount of $97.55 The balance was charged off and placed for collection.56 In

December 2011, Applicant and the creditor agreed to a repayment plan under which he 
was to make monthly payments of $150.57 By April 30, 2012, the remaining balance was 
reduced to $2,343.58 He has continued to do so, with his most recent payment being 
made on June 28, 2012.59 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a credit union credit card account with a credit limit of 
$5,000, and unpaid balance of $5,745, that was past due in the amount of $1,232.60 The 
balance was charged off and placed for collection.61 The collection agent added 
unspecified costs in the amount of $1,103, and as of June 2012, the total balance 
remaining on the account was $6,848.62  This account, as well as two others with the 
same creditor and collection agent (SOR ¶¶ 1.n. and 1.p.), were merged by the debt 
management plan,63 and Applicant has been making monthly payments of $200, 
including $66 on this account, since February 2012.64 The account is in the process of 
being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is a home repair center charge account with a high credit of 
$5,473, and unpaid balance of $5,473, that was past due in the amount of $1,276.65 The 
balance was charged off and sold to a collection agent in January 2010.66 Applicant 
contended that he and the collection agent agreed to a settlement of $3,785, as set out 
in correspondence that was supposedly attached to his Answer to the SOR,67 but no 
such document was attached. He made a payment of $185 on December 28, 2011,68

and his final payment of $3,600 on January 13, 2012.69 Although Applicant requested a 
statement from the collection agent that the account had been paid in full, no such 
statement was issued after nearly seven months.70 Nevertheless, the account is 
reported as “paid” in Applicant’s June 2012 credit report.71 The account has been 
resolved. 
  
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): Applicant’s October 2010 credit report listed a cell phone account 
with an unpaid balance of $3,387.72 In November 2011, he attempted to resolve the 
account by contacting the creditor, but was referred to the collection agent.73 The 
collection agent informed him that the account had been returned to the creditor.74 The 
creditor has no record of the account.75 Applicant has not received any responses from 
either the creditor or the collection agent since November 2011. The account is not 
listed in Applicant’s August 2011, February 2012, or June 2012 credit reports. Although 
Applicant believes he owes the money, based on the available evidence, I conclude that 
the account was either erroneously listed in the October 2010 credit report or has been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $3,000 and 
unpaid balance of $3,361 that was charged off and sold to a collection agent.76 The 
collection agent engaged the services of an attorney to collect the unpaid balance.77 
Applicant contacted the attorney in an effort to resolve the account, but the attorney 
demanded monthly payments of $580 for six months to settle the debt.78 Applicant was 
unable to commit that size payment and offered $100 per month.79 Applicant has 
agreed to furnish the attorney’s representative with financial information in an effort to 
agree to a monthly payment amount.80 If they are unsuccessful, Applicant has placed

(SOR ¶ 1.o.): This is a self-reported medical account with a medical provider with 
an unpaid balance of $873 that does not appear in any of Applicant’s credit reports.97 
Applicant was able to identify the medical provider, and he is currently negotiating a 
repayment plan with the collection agent.98 The initial request was for 6 monthly 
payments of $150 each, but Applicant countered with 12 monthly payments of $75 
each.99 Applicant is awaiting a response to his offer.100 If the negotiations are

(SOR ¶ 1.q.): Applicant’s February 2012 credit report listed an unspecified type of 
bank account with an unpaid balance of $4,505.107 The account, with no account 
number reflected, was charged off and closed at the consumer’s request.108 Applicant 
contended the account was actually one of his ex-wife’s credit cards.109 In fact, the 
account is a duplicate of the one identified in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant’s August 2011 credit 
report listed the same account as having an unpaid balance of $6,775,110 while the 
October 2010 credit report listed it as having an unpaid balance of $10,093.111 The 
diminishing unpaid balance can be attributed to the garnishment of Applicant’s wages 
that has been in place since 2010. As noted above, the account is in the process of 
being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.r.): This is an unspecified account with a high credit limit of $468 and a 
past-due balance of $137.112 The account is actually a duplicate of the telephone 
account alleged in (SOR ¶ 1.e.) that had a past-due balance of $468 that was charged 
off and sold to a collection agent.113 As noted above, the account was settled in full for 
$132.60.  Applicant made his final monthly payment of $66 in February 2012, and the 
account now has a zero balance. The account has been resolved. 
 
In July 2012, Applicant’s annual salary was $115,835, and his net monthly 
income was $6,849.114 His monthly expenses were $1,943, and his debt payments to 
his various creditors, including alimony for his ex-wife, were $4,754.115 He had a small 
balance for discretionary spending or savings. Applicant has no other debts as all of his 
accounts are current.116 Applicant intends to continue his repayment arrangements, and 
make larger payments when he is able to do so, until all of his accounts are resolved.

received the top rating of any employee in the company. Applicant has been an 
employee of the year.117 Applicant’s reputation for honesty and integrity is excellent, and 
he is trusted “implicitly.”118 He is reliable and dependable.119 
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”120 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”121   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”122 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.123  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”124 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”125 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

14 
                                      
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in about 2008 when 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or went to 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@126  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. Applicant’s financial problems commenced 
in 2008 when he began falling behind on his various payments. He attributed his 
financial problems to several factors, most of which were beyond his control: his second 
wife’s emotional instability and refusal to stop engaging in pyramid scams; her opening 
credit accounts and then ignoring the unpaid balances; extending themselves beyond 
their means; maintaining an expensive temporary residence in California for one year to 
make his job easier; and their separation with the associated extra costs of maintaining 
two residences, including spousal support. Although Applicant tried to stop his wife from 
spending money on a Jamaican lottery scam, he could not do so. Even after they 
separated, she continued to increase the unpaid balances of various accounts, and 
essentially ignored her financial responsibilities while causing Applicant’s financial 
situation to deteriorate. He finally diminished the negative impact she was having on his 
financial situation and divorced his wife, but only after agreeing to pay her significant 
                                                          
126
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

alimony. With the exception of extending themselves beyond their means, all of 
Applicant’s financial problems occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely 
to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.127  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. In late 2010, Applicant started contacting his 
creditors in an effort to resolve his accounts. He resolved some accounts and 
commenced payments on others. Nearly six months before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant enrolled in a free credit counseling program which furnished financial 
counseling, budget development, and debt elimination guidance. He enrolled in their 
debt management plan; establishing a budget and action plan, and identifying his 
creditors with a projected payment rate. He obtained a $3,000 salary advance to resolve 
some delinquent consumer debt. Applicant followed the financial guidance received, 
and continued to make his monthly payments to his remaining creditors. Circumstances 
may have been such that Applicant was unable to resolve all of his accounts by bringing 
them up-to-date or resolving them before the SOR was issued, but he did do so with 
several of his accounts. His failure with respect to his remaining accounts was not for 
lack of trying.128  
  
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a 
credit report without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit 
bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and 
“other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for 
concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, 
an individual’s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, 
the combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax credit reports and the Equifax credit 
reports referred to numerous creditors for relatively few delinquent accounts. Because 
of abbreviated names and acronyms, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, 
and have inflated the financial concerns. Likewise, the absence of account numbers or 
the true identity of the original creditors in the SOR to link an allegation to a particular 
account makes it more difficult for an applicant to track down the various creditors or 
collection agents associated with those accounts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
                                                          
127
 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
128
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside 
his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
16 
                                      
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He allowed several 
accounts to become delinquent, and they were either placed for collection, charged off, 
or went to judgment. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2008 when he began falling behind on his 
various payments because of his second wife’s emotional instability; her refusal to stop 
engaging in pyramid scams; her opening credit accounts and then ignoring the unpaid 
balances; maintaining an expensive temporary residence in California for one year to 
make his job easier; and their separation with the associated extra costs of maintaining 
two residences, including spousal support. Applicant attempted to limit the damage his 
wife was causing his financial situation, and finally divorced her, but only after agreeing 
to pay her significant alimony. Most of Applicant’s financial problems occurred under 
such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. Applicant sought guidance and 
assistance of a consumer debt counselor. He enrolled in their debt management plan; 
establishing a budget and action plan, and identifying his creditors with a projected 
payment rate. Some accounts were settled; some have been paid off; and he has 
continued to make his monthly payments to his remaining creditors. Applicant’s efforts 
pertaining to his delinquent accounts have been unrelenting, and have eliminated any 
doubt as to his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Moreover, several 
of the accounts alleged in the SOR are duplicates of other accounts alleged in the SOR. 
I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record 
evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.129 Applicant’s 
continuing good-faith efforts have been extensive, and are sufficient to mitigate security 
concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:130

In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
 Applicant has demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt reduction and 
elimination. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.
