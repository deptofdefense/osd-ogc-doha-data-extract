GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 31, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a Security 
Clearance Application (e-QIP).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on July 11, 2011.2 On February 2, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December

29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (financial considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 17, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated February 28, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
April 12, 2012, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after 
receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on May 18, 2012, and timely submitted 
additional documents to which Department Counsel had no objections. The case was 
assigned to me on August 7, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e. of the SOR). Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining 
allegations (¶¶ 1.f. through 1.j.). 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a maritime officer aboard a commercial vessel in the U.S. Merchant Marine. He 
obtained a bachelor’s degree in an unspecified discipline from a maritime academy in 
1998. He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve from 1999 until 2009, when he 
was discharged with an honorable discharge certificate. Applicant’s employment history 
between 1998 and 1999 has not been described. He joined his current employer in 
1999. Applicant was married in 1998. He and his wife have one daughter, born in 2001, 
and two sons, born in 1997 and 2002. It is unclear if Applicant ever held a security 
clearance. Department Counsel indicated that Applicant has held a top secret security 
clearance since 1988, but Applicant denied ever having a security clearance.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
As a maritime officer in the Merchant Marine, Applicant is aboard ship six to 
seven months each year. He returns home for 75 to 90 days at a time. Because of his 
travels, Applicant’s wife had control of the family finances, and, in the absence of 
information to the contrary, he generally assumed that they were being handled in a 
proper and timely manner. She had previously told him that she had an accountant help 
with the income taxes. There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2006 when he was served with a notice of foreclosure. Within a period of about two 
weeks, Applicant discovered his wife had: opened accounts and credit cards in his 
name; run up accounts without paying them; failed to make monthly mortgage 
payments for over 15 months; and failed to file or pay state income tax for multiple 
 
3 
                                      
 
years. As a result, accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or 
charged off. One account went into a pre-foreclosure status. Applicant retained an 
attorney to assist him in the foreclosure action, and an accountant to represent him with 
the state income tax issues.  
 
When interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) in February 2011, Applicant was unaware of certain accounts 
about which he was questioned. He stated his intention to find out more about each 
such account and, if it was due, to make arrangements to resolve the account. Applicant 
contacted all of the identified creditors, or collection agents, and made arrangements to 
resolve the delinquent accounts. His wife no longer has responsibility for the family 
finances, but because Applicant still travels extensively, he has enlisted his mother-in-
law’s assistance in handling them when he is away.  
 
 The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $44,737. Each account is described below, reflecting both the original 
and present status, as follows: 
 
 (SOR && 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d.): These are state tax liens for the tax years 
2001 through 2005, and 2007, totaling $60,046.3 In January 2009, more than 
three years before the SOR was issued, Applicant and the state entered into 
an offer-in-compromise agreement under which, commencing in February 
2009, Applicant agreed to 45 monthly payments in the amount of $1,000, with 
one payment in the amount of $144.4 As of June 2012, Applicant had made 
36 of the 45 payments on that account.5 On a second offer-in-compromise, 
Applicant agreed to make a $2,000 down payment and 24 monthly payments 
in the amount of $500. As of June 2012, Applicant had made the down 
payment and 3 of the 24 payments on that account.6 The accounts are in the 
process of being resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.e.): This is a medical account from an unidentified medical provider 
with a past-due balance of $209 that was placed for collection.7 Applicant 
located the creditor and in February 2012, paid the collection agent the entire 
balance.8 The account has been resolved.

 The SOR erroneously refers to the creditor as the “IRS,” but the creditor is actually the state office of 
revenue services.

 (SOR & 1.h.): This is a dental account from an unidentified dental provider 
with a past-due balance of $755 that was placed for collection with the same 
collection agent as above.9 There was apparently a snafu with the insurance, 
but it was resolved and the balance was paid in June 2011.10 The account 
has been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.f.): This is a home heating oil account with an unpaid balance of 
$276 that was placed for collection in 2006. Applicant contacted the creditor 
and paid the entire balance.11 The account has been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.g.): This is an electronics store account that was past due in the 
amount of $39 that was placed for collection.12 Applicant contacted the 
creditor and, on July 6, 2012, paid the entire unpaid balance.13 The account 
has been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.i.): This is an automobile loan from a credit union with a high credit 
of $19,263.14 According to a January 2011 credit report, where the account is 
reflected two times, and a July 2011 credit report, the account was either 
merely past due $961 with an unpaid balance of $5,100, or 150 days past due 
with an unpaid balance of $355.15 According to a January 2012 credit report, 
the account was listed two separate times, with one entry reflecting a high 
credit of $19,264 and a past-due balance of $355,16 and the other entry 
reflecting a high credit of $19,263 and a past-due balance of $5,100.17 All 
three credit reports, as well as the five separate entries therein, were 
erroneous. Applicant had actually paid off the entire account in June 200718 – 
four and one-half years before the SOR was issued. The account has been 
resolved.

 (SOR & 1.j.): According to a January 2011 credit report, this is bank credit 
card account with a high credit of $755 that was placed for collection, charged 
off, and transferred or sold to another collection agent.19 Extensive efforts by 
Applicant were made to locate the original creditor or the collection agent, and 
he finally tracked the account to a particular collection agent who indicated it 
had no record of the debt.20 The debt was apparently sold again, this time to 
the collection agent that collected the dental account with a past-due balance 
of $755 that was placed for collection and reflected in SOR & 1.h. Despite 
having paid the account in June 2011, the account still appears in a January 
2012 credit report as having a past-due amount of $25 with an unpaid 
balance of $297.21 The account has been resolved. 
 
 In July 2011, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement that reflected his 
monthly net income as $6,040,22 plus unspecified union benefits. After deducting his 
monthly expenses, including debt payments, he estimated he had a monthly net 
remainder of $1,039 available for discretionary spending or saving. He also submitted a 
weekly wage voucher reflecting a 60-hour work week at the rate of $43 per hour, 
reflecting a net weekly income of $2,130. There is no evidence that Applicant ever 
received financial counseling. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”23 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”24   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”25 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.26  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”27 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”28 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in about 2006 when some 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or, in one 
instance, went to a pre-foreclosure status. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Similarly, 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort 
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@29  
                                                          
29
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
 
8 
                                      
 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2006 
when he first discovered his accounts were delinquent. As noted above, because of his 
position as a ship’s master and his lengthy absences aboard ship six to seven months 
each year, Applicant’s wife had control of the family finances. He generally assumed the 
family finances were being handled in a proper and timely manner. His assumptions 
were not well-founded. Applicant discovered his wife had: opened accounts and credit 
cards in his name; run up accounts without paying them; failed to make monthly 
mortgage payments for over 15 months; failed to file or pay state income tax for a 
multiple year period; and lied to him about her mishandling of the family finances. It is 
clear that the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were without his 
knowledge and were largely beyond his control. Once he determined the extent of his 
financial problems, he took responsibility for the family finances away from his wife, 
enlisted his mother-in-law’s assistance in handling them when he is away, hired an 
attorney to assist him in the foreclosure action, and hired an accountant to represent 
him with the state income tax issues. Applicant’s financial problems occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Furthermore, he acted responsibly under 
the circumstances.30  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. While there is no evidence that Applicant has ever   
received counseling for his financial problems, there are clear indications that those 
financial problems are being resolved or are under control. Furthermore, once Applicant 
identified the creditors, he contacted each of them and in all but one instance, either 
obtained documentary confirmation that the account had been previously resolved, or 
he paid any remaining balance. That one exception is the one regarding the state 
income tax where he now has two offers-in-compromise and is making monthly 
payments as agreed.31  
  
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a 
credit report without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit 
bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and 
“other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for 
concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, 
an individual’s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, 
the 2011 and 2012 credit reports referred to one particular account as being delinquent 
when that account had actually been paid off in 2007. Also, because of abbreviated

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his

dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

names and acronyms, and the absence of full or, in some instances, even partial 
account numbers, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated 
the financial concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:32 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His lack of 
oversight regarding his wife’s handling of the family finances permitted accounts to 
become delinquent. As a result, accounts were either placed for collection, charged off, 
sold, or went to pre-foreclosure.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2006, when he first discovered their 
existence. As noted above, the financial problems – all of which were caused by his wife 
– were beyond his control and were without his knowledge. Upon discovering the 
situation, Applicant took control of the family finances away from his wife, contacted his 
creditors, and engaged the professional services of an attorney and an accountant. He 
has resolved all but one of his delinquent accounts and is in the process of resolving the 
remaining account.  
 
 I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.33 Applicant has 
demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt reduction and elimination. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).
