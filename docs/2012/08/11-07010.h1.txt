Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems. Applicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve the
financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about April1
9, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the
security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took
place July 10, 2012. The transcript (Tr.) was received July 25, 2012.  
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts (collection accounts) in amounts ranging
from $46 to $13,510 for a total of about $34,799. Applicant admitted these allegations in
her answer to the SOR, except for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.h. Her admissions are
accepted and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, the following
findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is seeking a
security clearance for the first time for her job as a food-service worker at a U.S. Air
Force base. She began this job in December 2010. Before that, she worked for many
years in sales and administration in local offices of a company that provides
supplemental insurance policies. Her husband has worked for the same insurance
company for many years. Married since 1979, she and her husband have five children
with birth years ranging from 1981 to 2002. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which she does not dispute.  She2
attributes the financial problems to her husband’s job several years ago, which also
resulted in multiple relocations to pursue his job with the same insurance company.3
Indeed, Applicant’s security clearance application shows residences in three different
states since 2002, and it also shows four residential addresses within their current city
and state since 2005. As a result, they fell behind on credit card accounts, which were
in her name and which her husband used for business expenses.

Their overall financial situation has improved, albeit slowly, since relocating to
their current city and state. The progress has been slow due to the weak economy. But
her husband recently moved from a district sales coordinator to a regional sales
coordinator position. Her husband’s income is irregular as the job involves sales,
multiple subordinate agents, and a complicated commission structure. But within the
next year or so, he has the potential to earn a six-figure gross income, perhaps as high
as $200,000.  The gross is before the normal deductions plus deductions for business4
expenses for operating the office, which run about $36,000 annually.5
Applicant has made good progress in addressing the delinquent debt, and she
provided documentary evidence confirming her efforts.  The debts and the current6
status of those debts are summarized in the following table.

SOR ¶ 1.m–$4,715 collection account. Making payments. (AE 3; Tr. 52)
Concerning the collection accounts with outstanding balances, Applicant’s plan is to
enter into a debt-repayment plan that consolidates the debts and allows a single
monthly payment. In addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant paid a total of $2,560 to
resolve debts owed to six creditors.7
Applicant presented the testimony of two character witnesses. Both witnesses
vouched for her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The first witness was an
active duty military officer (a full-bird colonel), and the second was a regional sales
coordinator from the same insurance company that employs her husband. Both
gentlemen traveled a substantial distance at their own expense to appear as witnesses.
In addition, she presented five letters from various individuals who support her
application for a security clearance.8
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As9
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt10
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An11

unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  12
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting13
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An14
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate15
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme16
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.17
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.18
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it19
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant20
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant21
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  22

indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline21
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  22
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Her unfavorable financial history indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within23 24
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions, and the facts also suggest a degree of financial irresponsibility.
 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a25
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort). 
 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).26

AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;25
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have considered all the mitigating conditions and two are most pertinent. The
first is AG ¶ 20(d), based on Applicant’s documented initiation of a good-faith effort to
repay the various collection accounts. Indeed, she has taken action on every debt that
she believes is valid, she has paid or settled four debts, and she is making payments on
the others, which she intends to address in the future through a debt-repayment plan
with a single monthly payment. She also resolved debts owed to six other creditors not
alleged in the SOR. The second is AG ¶ 20(e), based on the debt she is disputing as
invalid. 
Although Applicant has additional work to do, I am persuaded—based on the
actions taken to date and the favorable endorsements from the two character
witnesses—that Applicant has clearly and convincingly committed to resolving the
outstanding collection accounts. That outcome is made more probable based on the
expected increase in her husband’s income due to the recent job promotion. I am also
persuaded that she is  a good candidate for a security clearance to work in the defense
industry.  
Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I have no doubts or
concerns about Applicant’s fitness or suitability for a security clearance to work in the
defense industry. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and
considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Having done so, I26

conclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable
clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.m: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
