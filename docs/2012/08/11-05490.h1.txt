DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 21, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. 
This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
On April 20, 2012, and May 1, 2012, Applicant answered the SOR and requested 
a hearing. This case was assigned to me on May 23, 2012. DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing on May 24, 2012, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on June 7, 
2012. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 5 that were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called 
 
2 
 
one witness to testify on his behalf, and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and B that 
were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was left open until June 21, 
2012, to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional matters. He timely 
submitted documents that were marked as AE C through F and admitted into evidence 
without objection. Department Counsel’s email forwarding Applicant’s post-hearing 
submission was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on June 22, 2012. 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
At the hearing, Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement in 
Paragraph E3.1.8 of the Directive. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 42-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. In 
October 2010, he submitted a security clearance application for this prospective 
employment that would involve working in Afghanistan in support of coalition forces. 
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in management and technical operations in 
2001. He served in the Air National Guard from September 1990 to June 1998 and in 
the Air Force from July 1998 to December 2001, achieved the grade of staff sergeant 
(E-5), and received an honorable discharge. From January 2002 to July 2006, he 
served as an officer in the Air Force and received honorable discharge. Since then, he 
has been serving in the grade of captain (O-3) in the Air Force Reserve. He has been 
married twice. His first marriage was from November 1992 to March 1997. He married 
his current wife in January 2002. He has one child, a daughter who is 17 years old, and 
three step-children who range in age from 23 to 32. From approximately 1990 to 2008, 
he held a security clearance without incident.1  
 
 The SOR alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent debts totaling $598,395. In his 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied three debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o) totaling 
about $280,000 and, with comments, admitted the remaining debts totaling $318,395. 
His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.2 
 
 Applicant’s wife has been a licensed real estate agent for about 25 years. In 
1998, he obtained his real estate license. In 2005, he purchased four properties totaling 
about $787,000. These included the home in which he currently resides and a home for 
his parents in another city. In about 2006, his wife left a teaching position that she held 
for 15 years because they thought he was being reassigned to a new duty station. 
However, his stepson had a blood condition that required special medical treatment.

Because he was not offered a duty station that could accommodate his stepson’s 
medical needs, Applicant decided to leave active duty to start a real estate business.3 
 
 In the beginning, Applicant’s real estate business was successful. The real estate 
market, however, started to decline in 2007. Because his income was based on 
commissions, his financial situation was negatively impacted as the housing market 
deteriorated. He also had difficulty renting his investment properties. In January 2008, 
his mother passed away and he was saddled with the funeral expenses. He continued 
to perform Reserve duties until April 2008 when his security clearance was revoked due 
to his financial problems. In 2009, his wife was diagnosed with a Fibromyalgia and had 
knee replacement surgery. Because he fell behind on child support payments, his real 
estate license was suspended in February 2010, which further exacerbated his financial 
situation. The alleged debts are addressed below.4   
  
 SOR ¶ 1.a – charged-off account for $1,451. This is a credit card account with a 
date of first delinquency/date of last activity of September 2010. This account remains 
unresolved.5 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b – collection account for $200. This is a retail store account with a date 
of first delinquency/date of last activity of May 2009. This account remains unresolved.6 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c – collection account for $5,700. This is a credit card account with a 
date of first delinquency/date of last activity of September 2009. This account remains 
unresolved.7 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d – collection account for $22,413. This is a credit card account with a 
date of first delinquency/date of last activity of June 2009. Applicant entered into an 
agreement to make monthly payments of $230 on this debt. He stated he made only 
two of those payments, one in August 2010 and the other in May 2012. This debt 
remains unresolved.8 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e – charged-off account for $1,385. This is a telephone services 
account with a date of first delinquency/date of last activity of July 2009. The creditor

offered to settle this account for half of the delinquency, but Applicant was not able 
financially to accept that offer. This debt remains unresolved.9 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $16,454. This account is for child support 
arrearages. In his divorce, Applicant was ordered to pay $435 per month in child 
support. He fell behind in those payments. In December 2009, his ex-wife instituted 
legal action to garnish his wages and, for a period of time, his wages were garnished. 
Applicant’s real estate license and his driver’s license were suspended because of the 
child support arrearages. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided 
documentation showing he made child support payments of $707 in June 2009, $1,005 
in February 2011, and $983 in March 2012. His driver’s license was reinstated after the 
February 2011 payment. His real estate license is still suspended. This debt remains 
unresolved.10 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g – foreclosed mortgage for $36,568. This mortgage is for a house that 
Applicant purchased in January 2005. This house was purchased for $143,000 and had 
monthly mortgage payments of $1,100. From March to September 2005, he lived in this 
property and then rented it. At times, the property was unoccupied, and he began falling 
behind on payments. Foreclosure proceedings were initiated, but not completed. For the 
past six or seven months, the property has been vacant. Three short sale offers have 
been made on this property, but the mortgage holder has refused to accept those offers. 
This debt remains unresolved.11 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.p – collection accounts for $8,760 and $13,943, respectively. 
Both of these accounts are vehicle loans from the same creditor. Both vehicles were 
purchased for over $25,000 in 2005 and were repossessed in October 2007. In 2009, 
the creditor offered to settle both debts for $10,000. Under that settlement agreement, 
Applicant was required to pay $100 per month. He has made two payments under that 
agreement. The first payment was made shortly after the offer and the second was in 
the middle of 2011. These debts remain unresolved.12 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i – charged-off account for $11,991. This was a bank account with 
overdraft protection. Applicant and his wife used this account for living expenses. The 
date of first deficiency/date of last activity on this account was January 2010. This 
account remains unresolved.13

 SOR ¶¶ 1.j – mortgage past-due for $53,074 – and 1.l – charged-off mortgage 
for $49,322. These are the second and third mortgages on a house that Applicant 
purchased in 2005. This house was purchased for $235,000 and had monthly payments 
of $2,000. Applicant and his family currently reside in this home. The first mortgage was 
not alleged in the SOR as a delinquent debt. He entered into negotiations to modify the 
first mortgage. At the time he was negotiating that loan modification, the first mortgage 
holder also initiated foreclosure proceedings, but he filed paperwork to challenge that 
legal action. In November 2010, the court ordered the foreclosure proceedings to be 
held in abeyance. In December 2010, Applicant was approved for a loan modification 
trial period plan. Under the trial period plan, he was to make payments of $1,299 in 
February, March, and April 2011. He apparently made those payments and first 
mortgage was modified. However, he provided no proof of payments on the second and 
third mortgages. The third mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.j) was a homeowner equity line of credit 
that he obtained in 2005 to add a sun room to the house. The third mortgage holder has 
made him an offer to settle that debt for $5,000, but he has not been able to accept that 
offer. These alleged debts remain unresolved.14 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.k – mortgage past-due for $28,168 – and 1.m – foreclosed mortgage 
for $50,000. These are the first and second mortgages on a house that Applicant 
purchased for his parents in June 2005. This house was purchased for $184,000 and 
had monthly mortgage payments of $1,585. The original plan was for his parents to pay 
a portion of the mortgage payments, and he would pay the remainder. However, his 
parents decided they did not want to reside in this house. He then began renting it. At 
times, the property was unoccupied, and he was unable to make the mortgage 
payments. This property was sold at a short sale for $100,500 in 2010. He indicated the 
first mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.m) was satisfied in the short sale. In August 2010, he executed 
a promissory note for $16,000 to address the deficiency arising from the second 
mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.k). He stated that he was initially paying $133 per month towards 
that deficiency and later renegotiated a reduced payment of $35 per month. He 
indicated that he has been making the $35 payments for the past year, but provided no 
proof of those payments.15 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.n – mortgage for $46,000 foreclosed or paid for less than full balance 
– and 1.o – mortgage for $184,000 paid for less than full balance. These are the first 
and second mortgages on a house that Applicant purchased in 2005. This house was 
purchased for $225,000 and had monthly mortgage payments of $1,600. This was a 
rental property. At times, it was unoccupied, and he could not afford the mortgage 
payments. He indicated that the property was sold at a short sale for $170,000 in 2009,

modification trial period plan. He also provided paperwork showing the loan was modified.

Applicant provided bank statements showing he made payments of $35 on January 27, 2011, February 
14, 2011, and April 12, 2011, and a payment of $70 on September 14, 2011, but it is unknown to whom 
these payments were made.

and he received releases for the mortgages. His most recent credit report supports his 
contention that he has been released from these mortgages.16 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.q – collection account for $2,387. This is a loan that was used to 
purchase an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) for about $6,725 in 2005. Applicant’s last payment 
on this loan was two or three years ago. He still retains possession of the ATV. In 
January 2012, a collection agency offered to settle this debt for half of the amount 
owed, but he could not afford to accept that offer. This debt remains unresolved.17 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t – deferred student loans for $12,500, $21,807, and 
$32,272, respectively. Applicant is currently enrolled in a master’s degree program and 
indicated these student loans are deferred. At the hearing, he indicated one of the 
alleged debts was a duplicate. In his post-hearing submission, a document listing his 
the student loans does not contain SOR ¶ 1.r, which supports a determination that it is a 
duplicate. This document also indicated that he is $658 past due on SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.t. 
Nevertheless, I find for the Applicant on these three student loans because the SOR 
allegations did not assert that these student loans were delinquent.18 
 
 Applicant acknowledged that he has not received financial counseling. He 
estimated that his and his wife’s income was about $27,000 in 2011. In January 2012, 
he submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) that reflected his net monthly income 
was $1,701 and his total monthly expenses were $1,980, which left him with a negative 
net monthly remainder.19 
 
 In 1998, the police charged Applicant with possession of a firearm on school 
property. In May 2010, he was charged with driving while his driver’s license was 
suspended or revoked. In September 2010, he pled no contest to the driving violation 
and adjudication was withheld. At this hearing, he admitted that he committed both 
offenses. Regarding the firearm offense, he indicated that he unintentionally carried a 
loaded handgun to school in a backpack. While he was in a class, a bag holding the 
handgun fell out of the backpack unbeknownst to him, and the bag with the handgun 
was later discovered in the classroom after he departed. At that time, he did not have a 
license to carry a concealed weapon. The firearm charge was eventually dropped, and 
the handgun was confiscated. He believes the firearm charge has been expunged from 
his record. In about 2001, he disclosed the firearm offense before his security clearance 
was renewed.20

 Applicant has been awarded two Air Force Achievement Medals and three Air 
Reserve Forces Meritorious Service Medals. An officer performance report and 
education and training report reflect that his is an outstanding officer and selfless 
contributor. He has received numerous letters of appreciation or commendation for his 
professional achievements and volunteer services. At the hearing, a master sergeant 
testified that he has known the Applicant for approximately 18 years. The master 
sergeant stated Applicant was very reliable, honest, and trustworthy. Applicant also 
provided letters of reference that describe him as a dedicated, trustworthy, and talented 
individual.21 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
                                                          
21 Tr. at 24-28; GE 2; AE A, B.  
 
8 
 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to satisfy 
over a number of years. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Several Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
9 
 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant has multiple delinquent debts that remain unresolved. His financial 
problems are ongoing, significant, and cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) is not applicable.  
 
Applicant started a real estate business in 2006. At that time, his wife also was 
working as a real estate agent. In 2007, the housing market experienced a significant 
downturn. In 2008, his mother passed away, and he paid for her funeral expenses. His 
stepson had a blood disorder. In 2009, his wife was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and 
had knee replacement surgery. The downturn in the housing market, his wife’s and 
stepson’s medical problems, and the passing of his mother were conditions beyond his 
control that caused his financial difficulties. To obtain full credit under AG ¶ 20(b), 
however, both prongs of that mitigating condition, i.e., conditions beyond the individual’s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established. Of concern here are Applicant’s 
financial commitments in 2005. During that year, he purchased four properties totaling 
about $787,000, two vehicles totaling over $50,000, and an ATV for about $6,725, and 
he also obtained a homeowner equity line of credit of over $50,000. Those significant 
financial commitments over that short period of time raise questions about his judgment 
that he did not satisfactorily address at the hearing. Additionally, he failed to show that 
he took meaningful action to address the delinquent debts before he stopped working 
due to the suspension of his real estate license or the revocation of his security 
clearance. Based on the evidence presented, I cannot find that he acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
 
Applicant presented sufficient documentation to mitigate the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. Those mortgages were resolved during short sales of the applicable 
properties. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply to those debts. As noted above, I find in favor 
of Applicant on the student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t. SOR ¶ 1.r is a 
duplicate debt to which AG ¶ 20(e) applies. Although SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.t did not allege 
delinquent debts, those student loans may still be considered in assessing Applicant’s 
overall financial situation. The other 14 debts in the SOR have not been mitigated.  
 
Applicant’s financial situation remains unstable. He has not produced 
documentation showing regular payments towards his delinquent debts. He failed to 
 
10 
 
produce a realistic plan for addressing them. His financial problems continue to be a 
security concern. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has served in the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve 
for over 20 years. He has proven that he is an outstanding officer. Supervisors and 
acquaintances described him as a trustworthy and reliable individual. Although he was 
charged with criminal offenses in 1998 and 2010, those charges have limited security 
significance. The concern here is his financial situation, which remains unstable. His 
delinquent debts are not under control. In January 2012, he submitted a PFS that 
reflected he has a negative net monthly remainder. He has failed to present a realistic 
plan for resolving the delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns 
under the financial considerations guideline.
