TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has a history of delinquent debt, and he did not make sufficient 
progress resolving 15 delinquent debts, totaling about $57,000. He did not provide 
accurate information about his delinquent debts on his July 13, 2010, Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance 
application (SF-86). Financial considerations and personal conduct concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 13, 2010, Applicant submitted his SF-86. (GE 1) On May 25, 2011, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
the President promulgated on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
On August 12, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR. On December 9, 2011, 
Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On 
January 7, 2012, Applicant’s case was assigned to an administrative judge. On January 
23, 2012, Applicant’s hearing was cancelled because Applicant had medical problems. 
(Tr. 14) On March 28, 2012, DOHA transferred Applicant’s case to me. On April 10, 
2012, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for May 8, 2012. Applicant’s 
hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Applicant said he was ready for the 
hearing, and he did not request a delay in his hearing. (Tr. 15) Department Counsel 
offered four exhibits, and Applicant did not offer any exhibits. (GE 1-4) (Tr. 18-19) There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4. (Tr. 19) On May 16, 2012, I received the 
transcript. The record was held open until May 18, 2012. (Tr. 67-68) No post-hearing 
documentation was received. (Tr. 67) 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted responsibility for debts owed on the 
accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s; however, he denied that he 
owed the amounts alleged in the SOR for those debts. (Tr. 10-13) In some instances, 
he was making payments on these SOR debts. (Tr. 10-13) He explained that he 
believed the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.s for $104 should have been paid by Tricare. (Tr. 
13) He denied the other SOR allegations with explanations. (Tr. 13-14; HE 4)

1.a is a telecommunications collection debt for $198—UNRESOLVED. Applicant 
admitted responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 30) Although he remained unsure about the 
origin of the debt, he said he would pay it. (Tr. 30);  
 
1.b is a telecommunications collection debt for $391—UNRESOLVED. This debt 
is documented on Applicant’s credit reports. (Tr. 30-31; GE 3, 4) Applicant said that he 
currently has an active account with the same company, and he contended “there’s no 
way [he] could have a $391 bill.” (Tr. 30) The record was left open to permit Applicant to 
provide proof that his account was current; however, he did not provide any post-
hearing documentation. (Tr. 31); 
 
1.c is a telecommunications collection debt for $1,087—UNRESOLVED. 
Applicant denied that he ever had an account with the creditor. (Tr. 31-32) He did not 
provide evidence that he disputed the listing of this delinquent debt in his credit reports.;  
 
1.d  is a charged-off account for $9,825—UNRESOLVED. Applicant purchased a 
used 2002 Chevrolet in about 2005. He borrowed about $11,000 and the creditor placed 
a lien on the vehicle title. (Tr. 32-37) He made payments for about three or four years, 
and thought the debt was paid. (Tr. 33-36) The creditor advised him that he owed two 
more years of monthly payments. (Tr. 33) He stopped making payments, and the 
creditor repossessed the vehicle in around 2009. (Tr. 33-37);  
 
1.e is a charged-off account for $313—UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted 
responsibility for the debt, and he said he paid it with cash. (Tr. 37) However, he did not 
provide proof that he paid the debt.;  
 
1.f is a judgment filed by a bank for $22,639—UNRESOLVED. Applicant 
purchased a 2002 Dodge; he made payments on it for two or three years; and then it 
was repossessed. (Tr. 39) The debt has been delinquent since about 2005. (Tr. 40) He 
planned to pay the debt; however, he objected to the fairness of the post-repossession 
auction because he thought the creditor should have received more for the vehicle. (Tr. 
39-40);  
 
1.g is a collection debt for $300—DISPUTED. Applicant retained a cable box 
after he moved. (Tr. 41) He eventually provided the cable box to the cable company, 
and he believes the cable company erroneously failed to credit him with returning the 
cable box. (Tr. 41) He did not have a receipt for his return of the cable box. (Tr. 41);  
 
1.h is a telecommunications collection account for $991—UNRESOLVED. 
Applicant had a delinquent cell phone bill, which he thought should be about $325. (Tr. 
42) He disputed the amount of the bill; however, he did not provide documentation 
showing he disputed the debt. (Tr. 43);  
 
1.i is a past-due account for $4,015—PAYMENT PLAN. The payments are being 
taken, with Applicant’s consent, from his retirement pay. (Tr. 44, 47) The payments are 
mandatory until the debt is paid. (Tr. 46-47);

1.j is a department store collection account for $152—UNRESOLVED. Applicant 
opened an account; however, he did not purchase anything. (Tr. 47) He disputed his 
responsibility for this debt; however, he did not provide documentation showing he 
disputed the debt. (Tr. 47);  
 
1.k is a collection-insurance account for $94—UNRESOLVED. Applicant opened 
an account with the company; however, he said he made his payment up front. (Tr. 48) 
He disputed his responsibility for this debt; however, he did not provide documentation 
showing he disputed the debt. (Tr. 48);  
 
1.l is a bank collection account for $6,789—UNRESOLVED. Applicant disputed 
his responsibility for the debt because he did not recognize the name of the account 
holder. (Tr. 49) According to his credit report, the account was opened in 2004, and high 
credit was $3,440. (Tr. 48; GE 3) He did not provide documentation showing he 
disputed the debt.;  
 
1.m is a vehicle repossession collection account for $5,231—UNRESOLVED. 
The creditor repossessed Applicant’s 2005 Mercedes vehicle. (Tr. 49) Applicant 
purchased the used vehicle in December 2004 for $21,000 and his monthly payment 
was $630. (Tr. 51; GE 2 at 180) He used it for more than a year or two. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 
180) He left active duty in 2008, and he was unemployed. (GE 2 at 180) On August 2, 
2010, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he 
would pay the debt by 2011. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 180) He did not make any payments in the 
last 12 months to the creditor. (Tr. 52);  
 
1.n is a collection account for $2,498—UNRESOLVED. Applicant was unsure of 
his responsibility for the debt, and he wanted to investigate it. (Tr. 53) He did not provide 
documentation or correspondence with the creditor or credit reporting company to show 
he was diligently investigating his responsibility for the debt.;  
 
1.o is a vehicle repossession collection account for $15,649—DUPLICATION. 
This debt is a duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. (Tr. 50-51; 53);  
 
1.p is a collection account for $426—UNRESOLVED. Applicant obtained a loan 
in 2007, and it became delinquent in 2008. (Tr. 54; GE 3) On August 2, 2010, he told an 
OPM investigator that he would pay this debt in 2010; however, it remains unpaid. (Tr. 
54; GE 2 at 180);  
 
1.q is a telecommunications collection account for $2,178—UNRESOLVED. 
Applicant had an account with the creditor from 2007 to 2008. (Tr. 54) He disputed the 
amount owed to the creditor. (Tr. 55) He told the OPM investigator that he would pay 
this debt by 2011; however, it remains unpaid. (Tr. 54; GE 2 at 180);  
 
1.r is a collection account for $4,632—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said the debt 
was paid in full. (Tr. 56) He did not provide documentation or correspondence with the 
creditor to show he disputed the debt, or that the debt was paid.; and

1.s is a medical collection account for $104—DISPUTED. Applicant said his 
medical was covered by Tricare, and he was unsure of the nature or origin of this 
medical bill. (Tr. 57-58; HE 3)  
 
Applicant rented his residence with an option to purchase his residence, and his 
monthly payment is $1,920. (Tr. 58; GE 2 at 182) His payment to the creditor with a lien 
on his 2006 Mercedes vehicle is $787 a month. (Tr. 58-59) He paid a $10,973 non-SOR 
debt. (Tr. 59) His April 11, 2011 personal financial statement (PFS) shows the following 
monthly items: gross salary, including his military retirement, his 100 percent Veterans 
Affairs disability, and his spouse’s annual pay, of $5,921; deductions of $2,304; 
expenses of $3,166 (includes rent); debt payments of $1,407; and net remainder of 
negative $956. (Tr. 60-62; GE 2 at 182)2 
 
In 2012, Applicant was unemployed for three or four months, and then two weeks 
before his hearing, he became reemployed by the same employer that laid him off early 
in 2012. (Tr. 23) His interim clearance was revoked about three or four months ago. (Tr. 
26) He will likely be terminated from his employment if his security clearance is not 
reinstated. (Tr. 27) Applicant has not received financial counseling; however, he 
planned to obtain financial counseling in the future. (Tr. 66-67) He emphasized that over 
his many years of service to the Department of Defense he had been entrusted with 
substantial funds and responsibilities, and there were never any discrepancies or 
allegations of theft or misappropriation. (Tr. 73) He denied that he was a threat to 
national security. (Tr. 73) 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 In response to Section 26a of Applicant’s July 13, 2010 SF-86, which asked 
about bankruptcies filed in the last seven years, Applicant indicated he filed a petition 
for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1993 and 1994, and the 
petition was dismissed. (GE 1)  
 
Section 26m of his July 13, 2010 SF-86 asked whether in the last seven years, 
“Have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”, and Section 26n asked, 
“Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” Applicant responded, “No” 
to both questions, and he did not disclose the delinquent debts discussed in the 
previous section.  
 
In his SOR response, Applicant said his failure to disclose his delinquent debts 
was a mistake; however, he did not describe his state of mind at the time he signed his 
July 13, 2010 SF-86. (HE 4) At his hearing, he said he did not provide derogatory 
financial information because “that was my business; that was not the government’s 
[business].” (Tr. 65) He explained that if he was trustworthy enough for the Army to 
entrust him with expensive Army equipment and the lives of Soldiers, he should be 
trusted with a security clearance. (Tr. 65) Financial information is personal and many of

Applicant’s PFS is not properly completed, and the numbers on it may be unreliable. 
Accordingly, I draw no adverse inference from the information on his PFS. (GE 2 at 182)

the debts on his credit reports are disputed. (Tr. 65) He believed “it was not [for] the 
government to decide, okay, well you’ve had a poor credit history, so we know you’re 
going to do something wrong.” (Tr. 66) He admitted that he made a mistake in his 
answers on his SF-86, and he accepted responsibility for his decision. (Tr. 66)  
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Adverse clearance decisions are made “in terms of the national interest and 
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.” See 
Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision 
on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations), and E (personal conduct) 
with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SOR response, and his hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges 19 
delinquent debts, totaling about $77,000. Some debts have been delinquent more than 
four years. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts does not warrant full application of any 
mitigating conditions to all SOR debts. Four of his SOR debts are mitigated because 
they are not established, one debt is a duplication, and one debt is in an established 
payment plan. Although he did not provide proof of any payments to SOR creditors, I 
credit him with making the payments from his retirement pay to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i 
and with resolving the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, when he returned his cable box to the cable

The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

company. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.o duplicated the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. The medical debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.s for $104 should be reviewed by Tricare, and Applicant should be provided an 
explanation of benefits form from Tricare before he is deemed responsible for paying it. 
Although he did not provide any correspondence from or to creditors that he paid or 
resolved these four debts, I am crediting him with mitigating them. Except for the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.o, they are relatively modest debts, and it is reasonable for him not 
to have corroborating documentation.  
 
Applicant fell behind on his debts because of the costs of daily living, his 
spouse’s unemployment, and his own unemployment. He did not receive financial 
counseling. He showed some good faith when he admitted responsibility for some of his 
SOR debts in his SOR response and at his hearing.   
 
Applicant has not taken reasonable actions to resolve most of his SOR debts. He 
did not provide documentation proving that he maintained contact with his SOR 
creditors, and he did not provide any documentation showing his attempts to negotiate 
payment plans with his SOR creditors.4 There is insufficient evidence that his financial 
problem is being resolved and is under control. He did not establish his financial 
responsibility. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.

“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

AG  ¶ 16(a) applies. Section 26m of his July 13, 2010 SF-86 asked whether in 
the last seven years, “Have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”, and 
Section 26n asked, “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” 
Applicant responded, “No” to both questions, and he did not disclose his delinquent 
debts. Inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this 
case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
None of the mitigating conditions apply to all of the disqualifying conditions. The 
allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a that he intentionally failed to disclose derogatory information 
about his delinquent debts is substantiated. He admitted that he intentionally failed to 
disclose his delinquent debts because he did not believe it was relevant to his 
worthiness to hold a security clearance. He showed some remorse when he 
acknowledged that the omission of the derogatory financial information was a mistake, 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and he regretted his decision. His intentional falsification of his July 13, 2010 SF-86 is 
recent, serious, and not mitigated. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
There are some facts supporting mitigation of security concerns under the whole-
person concept; however, they are insufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. 
Applicant served his country as an infantry Soldier from 1988 to 2008, including in a 
combat zone during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. He is a 100 percent disabled 
veteran. He contributed to national defense while working for the Defense contractor. 
During his years of active duty service, he was entrusted with valuable and dangerous 
Army equipment, and the lives of Soldiers, and he never abused that trust. He is 43 
years old, and I am confident that he has the ability and maturity to comply with security 
requirements. He understands the importance of being honest on his SF-86. Some 
circumstances beyond his control, such as insufficient income, underemployment, and 
unemployment adversely affected his financial circumstances. He is an intelligent 
person who knows what he must do to establish his financial responsibility. There is no 
evidence of security violations, disloyalty, or that he would intentionally violate national 
security. His admission that he intentionally falsified his July 13, 2010 SF-86 is an 
important step towards rehabilitation and mitigation of security concerns.   
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial at 
this time. Applicant failed to mitigate 15 delinquent SOR debts, totaling about $57,000. 
He failed to prove that he could not have made greater progress resolving and 
documenting resolution of his SOR debts. In 2010, he told an OPM investigator that he 
would pay several debts, and he failed to do so. He knowingly and intentionally failed to 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
disclose derogatory financial information on his July 13, 2010 SF-86 because he did not 
believe the requirement to disclose such information was necessary or relevant to 
entrusting him with access to classified information. His failure to fully and candidly 
disclose negative information on his July 13, 2010 SF-86 shows lack of judgment and 
“raise[s] questions about [Applicant’s] reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information.” See AG ¶ 15.  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
and personal conduct concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude he 
is not eligible for access to classified information.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j to 1.n:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p to 1.r:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.s:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline H:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
