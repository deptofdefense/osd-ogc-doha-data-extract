ANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: 
 
 After a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I conclude that 
Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
                                                    Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on September 13, 2010. On January 5, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On February 6, 2012, Applicant answered the SOR. He elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2012. The 
parties agreed to a hearing on April 23, 2012. At the request of Applicant’s counsel, the 
 
2 
 
 
hearing was rescheduled to take place on May 2, 2012. I convened the hearing, as 
rescheduled, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no 
witnesses and introduced four exhibits (Ex.), which were marked Ex. 1 through 4 and 
entered in the record without objection. Applicant testified and called six witnesses. He 
filed a hearing memorandum with 15 attachments. I marked Applicant’s hearing 
memorandum as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1, and I marked the 15 attachments as Ex. A 
through Ex. O. Applicant’s hearing memorandum and his 15 exhibits were entered in 
the record without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 10, 
2012. 
 
                                                     Procedural Matters 
 
 The SOR alleged at ¶ 1.m. that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 
2009, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in September 2011. In his answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted the allegation but crossed out “Chapter 7” and inserted instead 
“Chapter 11.” After hearing Applicant’s opening statement, I asked the parties if they 
wished to amend the SOR allegation at ¶ 1.m. to conform to facts revealed in 
Applicant’s answer and opening statement. The parties then agreed to amend the SOR 
allegation at ¶ 1. m. to read as follows: “You filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the United 
States Bankruptcy Court of [jurisdiction deleted] in about March 2009. This bankruptcy 
was dismissed in about September 2011.” The amendment to the SOR was accordingly 
approved and entered in the hearing record.  
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR contains 13 allegations of financial conduct that raise security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.m.) In his Answer 
to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 13 allegations. Applicant’s admissions are entered as 
findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is 55 years old and employed as a senior systems engineer by a 
government contractor. He was first awarded a security clearance in 1994. In May 1979, 
he enlisted in the Army, where he served on active duty until March 1989. From March 
1989 until March 1992, Applicant served in the active reserves. He received an 
honorable discharge. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2.) 
 
 Applicant has been married three times. He married for the first time in 1977. He 
and his first wife divorced in 1992. Applicant and his second wife married in 1997. They 
divorced in 2002, as a consequence of financial disagreements. Applicant and his third 
wife have been married since 2005. Applicant is the father of two adult children, who 
were born during his first marriage. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2.) 
 
 Applicant and the woman who became his third wife purchased a home in 2003. 
They anticipated that they would be able to sell the home at a profit in about five years 
and purchase another home. In 2004, the couple refinanced the property and acquired 
 
3 
 
 
a balloon mortgage. Initially, under the balloon mortgage, their monthly mortgage 
payment was $1,700. However, it soon rose to $2,200 and then to $2,500 a month. (Ex.  
B; Ex. C; Tr. 104-105, 108-110, 151.) 
 
 In July 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased a timeshare in the Virgin Islands. 
In 2007, Applicant lost his job with a communications company. While he soon acquired 
a position with his current employer, his annual salary was considerably less than it had 
been previously. (Tr. 104-105, 1511-152.) 
 
 Applicant and his wife used savings to pay their living expenses and the balloon 
mortgage. Soon, however, they found it necessary to pay some of their monthly 
expenses with credit cards. Applicant acquired a second job, which he held from 
January 2008 until September or October of 2008. His gross pay from the second job 
was $300 or $400 a week. (Tr. 113-114, 169-171.) 
 
 Applicant’s financial situation grew more difficult. In January 2009, he sought 
legal counsel and was advised to file for bankruptcy. In March 2009, Applicant filed a 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. His counsel advised him to stop paying his delinquent debts. 
Applicant informed his security manager when he filed the bankruptcy. (Ex. 2; Tr. 113-
115.)    
 
 The amended SOR alleges Applicant’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy and 12 delinquent 
debts totaling approximately $436,751. The largest debt alleged in the SOR is 
Applicant’s home mortgage: $273,396. (SOR ¶ 1.a.) 
 
 Although the Chapter 11 bankruptcy was filed in March 2009, the majority of the 
affected creditors would not approve the payment plan proposed by the bankruptcy. 
Accordingly, the bankruptcy court dismissed Applicant’s Chapter 11 petition in 
September 2011. (Ex. 2; Ex. 4; Tr. 106-108, 148-149, 154-156.) 
  
 Applicant provided documentation showing that his home was sold at foreclosure 
in February 2010. Following foreclosure, Applicant was not responsible for a deficiency, 
and he owed nothing on the property. However, he acknowledged that at some time in 
the future he might receive a Form 1099-C and could owe federal tax on income 
imputed to him as a result of the foreclosure of the mortgage. (Ex. B; Ex. C; Tr. 108-
111; 138, 157-158.) 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant is responsible for the following unsatisfied bad 
debts owed to credit card companies: SOR ¶ 1.b. ($7,250); SOR ¶ 1.c. ($17,803, 
$20,041, and $8,365);1 SOR ¶ 1.d. ($16,566); SOR ¶ 1.e. ($32,193, $8,149, and 
$4,408); 2 SOR ¶ 1.f ($25,293); and SOR ¶ 1.i. ($933). (SOR; Ex. 2.) 
 
                                            
1
 SOR ¶ 1.c. alleges bad debts on three different accounts owed to one credit card company. (Ex. 2.) 
 
2 SOR ¶ 1.e. alleges three bad debts owed to one credit card company. (Ex. 2.) 
 
4 
 
 
 The debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.b. was closed by the credit grantor, and it remains 
unsatisfied. Applicant testified that he intends to contact the creditor and will make 
monthly payments on the debt in the future. (Ex. J; Tr. 118-119.) 
 
 Applicant had three different accounts with the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.c. 
The first delinquent account, for $17,803, was closed by the creditor and shows a zero 
balance on an April 2012 credit report provided by Applicant. Applicant stated that he 
had “negotiated a zero balance” with the creditor on the second delinquent account, 
which totaled $20,041. He further explained that the debt had been cancelled, and he 
had received a Form 1099-C from the creditor indicating that the debt had been 
attributed to him as income for Federal tax purposes. The third debt alleged under SOR 
¶ 1.c. totaled $8,365. Applicant explained that he still owed the debt and would pay it in 
the future. (Ex. A; Ex. E; Ex. K; Tr. 118-122.)  
 
 Applicant owed a delinquent credit card debt of $16,566 to a creditor identified in 
SOR ¶ 1.d.  This delinquent debt was also written off as a bad debt by the creditor. On 
Applicant’s credit report of April 30, 2012, the debt is listed with a zero balance. (Ex. A; 
Tr. 128-130.) 
 
 Applicant owed the following three delinquent debts to a creditor identified in 
SOR ¶ 1.e: $32,193, $8,149; and $4,408. All three debts were closed and cancelled by 
the creditor. (Ex. A; Tr. 131-136.) 
 
 Applicant owed a $25,293 delinquent debt to a creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.f. 
He asserted that he had settled the debt for $10,000, and he provided documentation to 
corroborate his assertion. (Ex. D; Tr. 134-135.) 
 
 Additionally, Applicant is responsible for a delinquent time share debt of $4,177 
and a delinquent maintenance fee on the timeshare of $997 (SOR ¶ 1. g. and SOR ¶ 1. 
h.). These debts have not been paid or otherwise resolved. Applicant stated that he 
would pay these debts at some time in the future. (Tr. 136-137, 152-153.)  
 
 Applicant also owes the following unsatisfied delinquencies: $933 (SOR ¶ 1.i.); 
$2,881 (SOR ¶ 1.j.); and $1,144 (SOR ¶ 1.k.). He stated that he would pay these 
delinquent debts at some time in the future. (Tr. 139-140.) 
 
 Applicant’s credit report of April 30, 2012, stated that two debts to a retail store, 
one for $7,995 and the other for $5,160, were included in his bankruptcy and had been 
discharged. These debts appear at SOR ¶ 1.l. Both debts show a zero balance. 
However, Applicant’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy was dismissed, and his debts were not 
discharged. (Ex. A; Tr. 106-108, 141.)  
 
 Applicant provided a personal financial statement dated April 29, 2012. He 
reported that his net monthly salary is $5,436. His wife’s net monthly salary is $3,981. 
The couple’s combined net monthly income is $9,417. (Ex. H.) 
 
5 
 
 
 Applicant reported the following fixed monthly expenses: rent, $1,200; groceries, 
$800; clothing, $100; utilities, $400; car expenses (insurance, repairs, gasoline), $1,000; 
life and other insurance, $150; medical expenses, $100; and miscellaneous, $500. (Ex. 
H.) 
 
 Applicant reported payments on three existing automobile debts each month. 
The three payments totaled $1,500. His net monthly remainder was $3,668. (Ex. H.) 
 
 Applicant has a plan to allocate $650 each month to pay the debts alleged at 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.c., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.k. These debts total $25,940. He had 
financial counseling associated with his bankruptcy filing in 2009. At the time of his 
hearing, he had not implemented his payment plan. (Ex. H; Ex. I; Tr.148.)  
 
 Applicant presented six witnesses who spoke on his behalf. His security officer 
testified that Applicant was open and forthcoming in informing her of his financial 
problems. Four individuals who supervised Applicant described his work performance 
as “exemplary.” Additionally, the supervisors praised Applicant’s integrity and stressed 
his value to the organization. A coworker also testified and stated that Applicant was an 
exceptional worker. (Tr. 52-96.)    
 
                                                Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and 
it has emphasized that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the 
Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, an 
administrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). 
In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative 
guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are 
used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
 
6 
 
 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 
7 
 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable 
or unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
Several Guideline F mitigating conditions could apply to the security concerns 
raised by Applicant’s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial delinquency might be 
mitigated if it “happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” (AG ¶ 20(a)) Additionally, 
unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if “the conditions that resulted in the 
financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control, (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” (AG ¶ 20(b)) Still other 
mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include evidence that “the person has 
received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” (AG ¶ 20(c)) or “the individual has 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” (AG ¶ 
20(d))  Finally, if “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of options to resolve the 
issue,” then AG ¶ 20(e) might apply.  
 
 Applicant admitted a history of financial difficulties. In 2003, he purchased a 
home and agreed to finance the property with a balloon mortgage. In 2005, he 
purchased a timeshare property. In 2007, he was laid off from his job. While he acquired 
another job, his pay was considerably lower. Applicant’s monthly mortgage obligations 
rose beyond his ability to pay. He and his wife used credit cards to pay their monthly 
expenses. His financial obligations overwhelmed his capacity to pay them. While 
Applicant experienced some financial reversals that were beyond his control, his 
response - using credit cards to meet current living expenses - was not responsible 
under the circumstances. 
 
 Applicant sought legal counsel. Upon the advice of counsel, he stopped paying 
his debts and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. Applicant’s creditors refused to 
participate in the bankruptcy proceedings. In 2011, a bankruptcy court dismissed his 
Chapter 11 petition.  
 
 Applicant and his wife have a combined monthly net income of $9,417. After 
meeting their monthly expenses and making payments of $1,500 on three automobile 
debts, they report a net monthly remainder of $3,668.  
 
 Applicant had financial counseling when he filed for bankruptcy in 2009. To his 
credit, Applicant settled one of the 12 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He also 
 
8 
 
 
received a Form 1099-C from the creditor identified at SOR ¶ 1.c when the creditor 
cancelled a debt of $20,041. 
 
  At his hearing, Applicant proposed a plan to allocate $650 each month to pay 
seven of the debts alleged in the SOR. However, at the time of his hearing, he had not 
yet initiated payment, and the debts remained unsatisfied. While he appears to have 
sufficient resources to satisfy the debts, it is not clear from the record that he will do so 
in a timely and consistent manner. In determining an individual's security worthiness, 
the Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her 
outstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 
1999). Accordingly, I conclude that while AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part to Applicant’s case, 
none of the other Guideline F mitigating conditions fully apply to the facts of his case. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person of 55 
years. His financial problems began several years ago and are ongoing. While Applicant 
acted reasonably in following the advice of counsel to withhold payment of his debts 
during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy was dismissed in September 2011, 
nine months ago. Since that time, Applicant has proposed a plan to resolve his financial 
delinquencies. He reports he has sufficient income to pay his debts, and therefore there 
appear to be no impediments to prompt resolution of debts that are several years old. 
However, the majority of Applicant’s financial delinquencies remain unresolved. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s judgment as well as his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For 
 
9 
 
 
these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from 
his financial delinquencies.  
 
                                                 Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST  APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.:  For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.b - 1.e.:  Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.f.:  For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.g. - 1.l.: Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.m.:           For Applicant     
 
                                          Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
