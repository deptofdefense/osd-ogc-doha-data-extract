GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 1, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On February 23, 2007, Applicant applied for a 
security clearance and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations 
Processing version of a Security Clearance Application (e-QIP).2 On an unspecified 
date, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on December 12, 2011.3 DOHA 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him on February 24, 2012, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February

20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 12, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated March 29, 2012, Applicant requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed on May 15, 2012, and the case was assigned to me on May 18, 2012. A Notice 
of Hearing was issued on May 25, 2012, and I convened the hearing by video 
teleconference, as scheduled, on June 13, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, 9 Government exhibits (GE 1 through 9) and 17 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through Q) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 21, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, one portion of a 
factual allegation (¶ 1.a.) pertaining to personal conduct of the SOR. He denied the 
remaining portion thereof as well as the remaining allegation. Applicant’s admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, from May 
2011, has served as a project manager.4 He was previously employed in a variety of 
positions including programmer/analyst, software project engineer, software engineer, 
systems engineer, consultant, technical project engineer, electrical designer, and 
principal systems engineer.5 Applicant served as a Private (E-2) in the U.S. Army 
Inactive Reserve from December 1987 until February 2002.6 He received a secret 
security clearance in April 1988, and again in October 2004.7 He does not currently 
have a security clearance.8

Applicant was married in December 1998, separated in December 2000,9 and 
divorced about two years ago.10 Although Applicant was not legally divorced until about 
two years ago, for many years, and at least as recently as June 2007, Applicant led his 
family to believe he was divorced.11 He and his wife have a son, born in November 
1999.12 Applicant has been in a spouse-like relationship with a woman since at least 
June 2007,13 and he and his girlfriend have a son, born in September 2004. A 1984 high 
school graduate,14 Applicant attended a university from January 1994 until May 1996, 
withdrew for a period, reenrolled in September 1996 and attended the school until 
December 1997, withdrew again, and reenrolled again and attended school from 
January 1998 until May 1998.15 He never received a degree.16 Applicant attended 
another university from January 2002 until October 2002, and in November 2002, after 
completing nine units,17 he received a Master’s Certificate in Information Technology 
Project Management.18 The certificate is not the same as a master’s degree.19 
 
Personal Conduct 
  
On April 1, 2003, Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86. The SOR 
alleges Applicant falsified material facts when he falsely stated that he had received a 
bachelor’s degree on May 20, 1996 (SOR & 1.b.).20 In fact, as noted above, he never 
received such a degree.21 In June 2007, when he was interviewed by an investigator 
from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant told the investigator 
that he had obtained his bachelor of science degree in computer science in May 1996.22

That statement was false. Applicant denied the SF 86 response was deliberate or an 
attempt to falsify the material facts, and attributed his response not to imply receipt of a 
degree, “but to support the timeline of [his] having left the University on a full-time basis 
and [his] reentering the workforce.”23 He also testified that his response in the SF 86 
was “my belief was that I'm identifying I'm going to school, identify a period of time and I 
identify the degree that I'm pursuing, not that I had completed the degree.”24 
 
On January 27, 2009, Applicant was terminated from his employment for 
“mischarging.”25 A number of e-mails were sent between Applicant’s supervisor and 
Applicant, and there were meetings and telephone calls involving the Director, Systems 
Engineering, the Director, Human Resources, and Applicant, over the period from 
December 19, 2008, to January 27, 2009, regarding Applicant’s work activities during 
an 88 hour period.26 Although Applicant contended he had performed company-related 
work during those hours, he was unable to provide proof of his activities as he had 
misplaced his thumb drive.27 Applicant eventually furnished some materials which he 
contended he worked on, but senior management determined it was old work and not 
sufficient to justify the hours Applicant claimed.28 Applicant was terminated “for violating 
company policy regarding accurate charging of labor hours.”29 He subsequently found 
his thumb drive and printed out some of the work product, but did not notify his former 
employer that he had done so.30 
 
Applicant filed a claim with the state office of unemployment insurance which 
determined his conduct:31

Applicant furnished several documents which he contended were his work product for the period in issue. The 
documents were mostly reprints of materials that were dated before the period in issue (Applicant Exhibit L, dated 
November 24, 2008; Applicant Exhibit O, dated May/June 2005; Applicant Exhibit P, dated February 1997; and 
Applicant Exhibit Q, dated October 7-8, 2004); or generic undated documents (Applicant Exhibit M and Applicant 
Exhibit N). He also provided a computer printout that reflected documents he supposedly created or modified during 
the period in issue (Applicant Exhibit K), but only two such documents were listed (at 4, 6).

was either a deliberate and willful disregard of the standards of behavior 
which the employer has a right to expect or a series of repeated violations 
of employment rules proving a wanton disregard of his/her obligations to 
the employer. Under [the state’s] unemployment insurance law, this 
constitutes gross misconduct in connection with the work. 
 
Applicant appealed the decision. The decision of the state Appeals Division was 
that the employer failed to establish a written company holiday work policy; Applicant’s 
testimony or documentary evidence was not credible; and Applicant had “engaged in 
conduct that demonstrated a deliberate and willful disregard of standards that an 
employer has a right to expect. . . .”32 
 
Work Performance 
 
 Applicant’s performance reviews indicate that his job performance is generally 
the second level from the top, or “exceeds expectations.” The quality of his work is 
generally the same or one level below – “meets expectations.” The quantity of his work 
has fluctuated from the second lowest level – “sometimes meets expectations” – to the 
second highest level. Nevertheless, in 2006 and 2007, Applicant was periodically 
promoted or given an increased salary for his contributions to the success and growth of 
his employer.33  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”34 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”35   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating

conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”36 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.37  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”38 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”39 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
                                                          
36
 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), security concerns may be raised when there is a: 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.”  
Similarly, “deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant 
facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other 
official government representative,” is potentially disqualifying under AG & 16(b). If there 
is: 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of:  
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client 
confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of 
sensitive corporate or other government protected information; (2) 
disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a 
 
8 
                                      
 
pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) evidence of significant misuse 
of Government or other employer's time or resources, 
security concerns may be raised under AG ¶ 16(d). 
In April 2003, when Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86, he falsely 
stated that he had received a bachelor’s degree in May 1996. In June 2007, when he 
was interviewed by an investigator from OPM, Applicant told the investigator that he had 
obtained his bachelor of science degree in computer science in May 1996. In fact, as 
noted above, he never received such a degree. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) have been 
established.  
 
In January 2009, Applicant was terminated from his employment for 
“mischarging,” also referred to as “violating company policy regarding accurate charging 
of labor hours.” His subsequent claim with the state office of unemployment insurance 
was unsuccessful. That office opined that Applicant’s conduct “was either a deliberate 
and willful disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has a right to 
expect or a series of repeated violations of employment rules. . . .” Applicant’s overall 
conduct pertaining to both his misrepresentation as to his education and to his working 
hours support a conclusion that there is “a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations,” and 
“evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or resources.” 
AG ¶ 16(d) has been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(a) may apply if “the individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before 
being confronted with the facts.” Similarly, if “the offense is so minor, or so much time 
has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” AG ¶ 17(c) may apply.  
 
As to Applicant’s degree issue, he eventually acknowledged that he did not have 
a bachelor’s degree, but only did so after falsely reporting it in his 2003 SF 86 and to the 
OPM investigator in 2007. It was not until he was confronted with the true facts in late 
2011 that he acknowledged the true status of his degree, but attributed his response not 
to imply receipt of a degree, “but to support the timeline of [his] having left the University 
on a full-time basis and [his] reentering the workforce.” As to Applicant’s mischarging of 
labor hours, the proof he offered his employer, the state unemployment insurance 
office, and to me, was insufficient to support any conclusion other than that it was work 
that predated the claimed period of work and not sufficient to justify the hours Applicant 
claimed.  AG ¶¶ 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
9 
                                      
 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.40       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. With the 
exception of his 2009 termination from employment, he has generally been a good 
employee.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s history includes several instances of dishonesty. Over a period of years, he 
continued to give his family the false impression that he was divorced when, in fact, he 
was not.41 He repeatedly lied to the Government in writing and during an OPM interview 
about having a degree when, in fact, he did not. And, he lied to his employer about his 
working hours. Applicant has offered explanations for his actions, and furnished 
documents in an effort to support his contentions that he did not lie about his work 
hours. However, as the state Appeals Division noted, Applicant’s testimony or 
documentary evidence was not credible. Under the evidence presented, I have 
significant questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
41 The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to reveal to his family members that he was not actually 
divorced as he led them to believe. The SOR did not allege that he provided false information to the OPM investigator 
about his degree status. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated

Formal Findings 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
