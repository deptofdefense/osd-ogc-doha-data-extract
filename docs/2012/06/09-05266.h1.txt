TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
On July 16, 2008, Applicant intentionally failed to provide accurate information on 
his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security 
clearance application (SF-86). On October 21, 2008, he made an intentionally false 
statement to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator when he lied 
about the reason he was terminated from employment. Personal conduct concerns are 
not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 16, 2008, Applicant submitted his SF-86. On December 7, 2011, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
the President promulgated on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct). The 
SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and it

recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination 
whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
On January 9, 2012, Applicant’s undated response to the SOR was received at 
DOHA.  On March 14, 2012, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed 
on Applicant’s case. On March 28, 2012, Applicant’s case was assigned to me. On April 
17, 2012, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for May 15, 2012.  
Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel offered 11 exhibits, 
and Applicant offered 26 exhibits. (Tr. 14, 26-27; GE 1-11; AE A-Z) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-11 and AE A-Z. (Tr. 14, 27, 101) The record was held 
open until May 22, 2012. (Tr. 102, 110-111) Five post-hearing documents were 
admitted without objection. (AE AA-EE) On May 24, 2012, I received the transcript. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant admitted in his SOR response that he used cocaine in about November 
2004, and he was terminated from his employment because he was positive on a drug 
test for the presence of cocaine in his urine. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b; HE 3) He also 
admitted that he was terminated from employment in about October 2007 for a safety 
violation, and on or about March 2010, he was arrested and charged with 
communicating threats. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e; HE 3) He denied the remaining SOR 
allegations. His admissions are accepted as factual findings. 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old supervisor of security personnel working for a defense 
contractor. (Tr. 15-19) He has been employed by his employer for five years. He was a 
truck driver in the civilian sector from 1987 to 2008. (Tr. 31) He graduated from high 
school in 1982. (Tr. 20) He has about 16 college credits. (Tr. 20)  
 
Applicant served in the Army on active duty from 1983 to 1986, and he received 
an honorable discharge. (AE H) He left active duty as a specialist four (E-4). (Tr. 28-29, 
38; AE H) From early 1987 to 2006, he served in the Army Reserve. (Tr. 29-30) His 
highest rank in the Army was staff sergeant (E-6). (Tr. 30, 38) He was promotable to 
sergeant first class (E-7). (Tr. 38) During his Army service, he received one Army 
Service Ribbon (ASR), one National Defense Service Medal (NDSM), two Army 
Achievement Medals (AAM), one Good Conduct Medal (GCM), and two Overseas

Applicant was initially administratively reduced from staff sergeant to sergeant 
(E-5) in June 2005, and then from sergeant to private (E-1) in April 2006, for missing 
reserve duty. (Tr. 30-35) He was not present for reserve duty because he needed to 
work in his civilian job driving trucks. (Tr. 35-40) He received an other than honorable 
(OTH) discharge from the Army Reserve. (Tr. 32-34, 36-37) He asked the Army 
Discharge Review Board to upgrade his OTH to an honorable discharge. (AE I) He 
received a negative noncommissioned officer evaluation report (NCOER) for the period

May 2004 to April 2005; however, Applicant believed it was unfair because he was not 
present in the unit for a sufficient time for the rating chain to form such a negative 
perception of his performance. (Tr. 40-41; AE L) 
 
Applicant successfully completed the Army’s Basic and Advanced 
Noncommissioned Officer courses at the top of his class. (Tr. 21, 35-36, 41-42; AE M) 
He received awards for physical fitness and leadership. (Tr. 41-42; AE O, Q, R) His 
military occupational specialty (MOS) was medical specialist or medic (91A). He 
successfully completed various training courses while in the Army and in his civilian 
employment. (Tr. 21; AE M, P)  
 
Applicant married in 1989, was separated from his spouse in 2003, and was 
divorced in 2010. (Tr. 23-24) His son is 23 years old. (Tr. 22-23) He pays his son’s 
college tuition, student loans, and $400 to $500 per month for expenses. (Tr. 24-26) His 
annual salary is about $55,000 per year. (Tr. 26)   
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 In about November 2004, Applicant used cocaine at a party. (Tr. 43; SOR 
response) He was in the Army Reserve; however, he was unsure whether he held a 
security clearance at that time. (Tr. 43) He denied that he used drugs any other time 
while in the Army Reserve. (Tr. 43) His cocaine use was experimental and recreational. 
(Tr. 43) His civilian employment involved driving a truck, and his employer prohibited 
illegal drug use. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant was caught on his employer’s random drug testing 
program, and terminated from his employment. (Tr. 44-46; SOR response) He did not 
inform his Army Reserve unit that he used cocaine “because [he] didn’t think it was 
serious.” (Tr. 46)  
 
 In about October 2007, Applicant pulled the wrong trailer out of the dock, and a 
forklift fell off of the dock. (Tr. 46) His employer fired Applicant for committing a safety 
violation. (Tr. 46, 56; SOR ¶ 1.d; SOR response)  
 
On October 21, 2008, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant about his 
November 2004 termination of employment. (GE 3 at 283-285) The summary of the 
OPM interview indicates Applicant said he was fired for driving too fast for weather 
conditions. (Tr. 48; GE 3 at 284; SOR ¶ 1.c) He denied to the OPM investigator that he 
had ever had a positive drug test. (Tr. 52; GE 3 at 285) 2  
                                            
2
Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he lied to the OPM investigator when he denied that he 
ever had a positive drug test. The facts describe several other inconsistent statements in DOHA 
interrogatories, to the OPM investigator, and at his hearing. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant’s July 16, 2008 SF-86 asked, “19: Your Military Record—Have you 
ever received an other than an honorable discharge from the military?” He answered 
“No” to this question. (SOR ¶ 1.f; GE 1) Applicant explained that he had moved, and he 
did not receive notification that he had received an other than honorable discharge until 
2006. (Tr. 66-67) This explanation is not credible because he knew of his OTH 
discharge about two years before he completed his 2008 SF-86. He said he did not 
disclose his OTH discharge because of “an oversight.” (Tr. 68)  
 
Applicant’s July 16, 2008 SF-86 asked, “22: Your Employment Record—Has 
any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years? 1. Fired from a job.” (SOR ¶ 
1.g; GE 1) He said he did not disclose his firings in 2004 and 2007 because of an 
oversight. (Tr. 68)  
 
Applicant’s July 16, 2008 SF-86 asked in section 23e whether in the last seven 
years he has been subjected to non-judicial punishment (NJP) under the Uniform Code 
of Military Justice. (GE 1) Applicant answered, “No” and failed to disclose any NJP. (Tr. 
69; GE 1) He said, “Because I didn’t understand this [NJP]. Like I said, I never had 
nothing like that happen to me. So, when you said [NJP], a reduction in rank and [NJP], 
I didn’t understand that one.” (Tr. 70) He said he did not receive a hearing. (Tr. 70-71) 
He just received a letter announcing that he was reduced in rank. (Tr. 71)3  
 
Applicant failed to disclose his 12-step alcohol treatment program from 2003 to 
2004 on his July 16, 2008 SF-86, and he attributed this mistake to another possible 
oversight. (Tr. 83-85; GE 1) 
 
Applicant’s July 16, 2008 SF-86 asked, “24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and 
Drug Activity a. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have 
you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, . . . cocaine . . . ?” Applicant 
answered, “No” to this question. (SOR ¶ 1.h) He said he did not know why he failed to 
disclose his cocaine use in 2004. (Tr. 71)  
 
                                                                                                                                            
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Consideration non-SOR allegations outlined in this decision is strictly limited to these five 
circumstances.

The allegation that Applicant received NJP is not established. Applicant’s Army Reserve orders 
indicate Applicant was administratively reduced from staff sergeant (E-6) to sergeant (E-5) and then to 
private (E-1) under Army Regulation (AR) 135-178, Army National Guard and Army Reserve Enlisted 
Administrative Separations (March 13, 2007). AR 135-178, paragraph 2-9(e)(5), states, for example, 
“When a Soldier is to be discharged under other than honorable conditions, the separation authority will 
direct an immediate reduction to private E–1, in accordance with AR 600–8–19, chapter 10.” AR 600–8–
19, Personnel—General Enlisted Promotions and Reductions (April 30, 2010), Chapter 10, permits 
administrative reductions of enlisted personnel for misconduct or inefficiency without imposing NJP under 
Article 15, UCMJ. (GE 10; AE S)

Applicant’s July 16, 2008 SF-86 asked, “28: Your Financial Delinquencies—a. 
In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?; [and] b. 
Are you currently delinquent on any debt(s)?” Applicant answered, “No” to both 
questions. (SOR ¶ 1.i) (Tr. 71-72) Applicant said he was unemployed for four to six 
months before he obtained his current employment; however, he was not aware that he 
had any delinquent debts because his debts were in one state, and he “had moved to 
two different states by then.” (Tr. 63, 72) The SOR and his August 28, 2009 credit report 
only indicated six delinquent debts totaling about $1,500 as being delinquent more than 
90 days. (SOR ¶ 1.i; GE 11) In May 2012, he paid several delinquent debts. (AE T-Z) 
 
On September 11, 2008, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant. (GE 2 at 
372-374) Applicant said he did not have any problems at any of his employments. (GE 2 
at 373) He denied being employed by the employer that fired him in November 2004, 
and he denied living in the state where that employer is located. (GE 2 at 373) He 
certified the accuracy of the OPM summary on September 9, 2009. (GE 2 at 369) 
 
On July 2, 2009, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant. (GE 2 at 370-371) 
Applicant admitted that he received an OTH discharge from the Army Reserve in April 
2006. (GE 2 at 370) He also disclosed his reduction in rank; however, he said it was for 
unsatisfactory performance and not from NJP. (GE 2 at 370-371) He certified the 
accuracy of the OPM summary on September 9, 2009. (GE 2 at 369) 
 
On August 28, 2009, Applicant responded, “No” to a DOHA interrogatory that 
asked whether he used any illegal drugs. (Tr. 54-55; GE 5 at 393) He said he attended 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings from 1987 to 1989, three times per week. (GE 5 
at 392) He admitted that his response about his illegal drug use was incorrect; however, 
he denied that he was trying to hide his illegal drug use in 2004. (Tr. 55) He said he 
“probably wasn’t thinking correctly.” (Tr. 56) 
 
On December 11, 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said he 
used cocaine on an occasional basis from 2004 to 2005 and methamphetamines three 
times. (GE 7 at 320, 323) His date of last cocaine use was when he was caught on the 
urinalysis test, which resulted in the termination of his employment. (GE 7 at 320) He 
attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings from November 2003 to February 2004. 
(GE 7 at 322) He also attended daily AA meetings in August 2006. (GE 7 at 322) 
   
In March 2010, at a local parking lot, a female made an offensive remark about 
Applicant’s gospel music, and Applicant said he would “blow that [rebel] flag off the back 
of [their] van.” (Tr. 58) Applicant denied threatening to blow a lieutenant’s head off. (Tr. 
58, 60-61) On March 21, 2010, Applicant was arrested at his current place of 
employment and charged with communicating threats. (Tr. 56) Applicant went to court, 
shook hands with the lieutenant, and the charge was dropped. (Tr. 58-60) 
 
On March 22, 2010, Applicant affirmed the accuracy of his October 21, 2008 
OPM interview summary without indicating any changes or corrections were necessary. 
(Tr. 50-51; GE 3 at 289) In that OPM interview summary, Applicant said he told the 
OPM investigator that he was fired for failure to comply with policy. (Tr. 48, 54) He 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
admitted that he was “being deceitful to myself” because he “was trying to get a job” 
when he denied that he tested positive for illegal drug use. (Tr. 52-53) He regretted not 
providing correct information to the OPM investigator. (Tr. 52) He is “on medication for 
memory loss.” (Tr. 52) He agreed with Department Counsel’s characterization that he 
lied to the investigator. (Tr. 53-54)  
 
On May 29, 2010, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. (GE 8) He 
admitted to using cocaine three times, with his most recent cocaine use being on 
November 20, 2004. (GE 8 at 268) He attended NA meetings from November 2003 to 
February 2004. (GE 8 at 269) He attended AA meetings on a daily basis in August 
1996. (GE 8 at 269)   
 
On December 13, 2010, Applicant admitted to an OPM investigator that he used 
cocaine, and he was terminated from his employment because he was positive on a 
drug test for the presence of cocaine in his system. (GE 4 at 59) He was terminated 
from employment in about 2007 for a safety violation. (GE 4 at 57) He said his failure to 
disclose information about his employment terminations on his SF-86 was unintentional. 
(GE 4 at 58) He also disclosed his alcohol treatment under a 12-step AA program from 
December 2006 to June 2007. (GE 4 at 60)  
 
Applicant was a medic in Operation Desert Shield/Storm, and he served in a 
Saudi Arabian hospital and a U.S. Army combat support hospital. (Tr. 73-74, 86; AE G) 
He was exposed to Scud missiles and enemy shelling. (Tr. 74) He assisted in the 
treatment of seriously injured people. (Tr. 75) He cleaned dead bodies. (Tr. 75)  
 
Recently, one of his friends, who was a Special Forces veteran, shot a police 
officer and then killed himself. (Tr. 80) Applicant has nightmares and was diagnosed 
with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2009 and depression. (Tr. 76, 81; AE A, 
D, BB) His PTSD and other ailments may have contributed to his decision to experiment 
with illegal drugs. (Tr. 76; AE BB) He attends his weekly PTSD treatment appointments; 
he wants to reduce his daily intake of medications; and he stays positive about his 
treatment and future. (Tr. 78, 81-82, 88; AE BB) He has a medical disability claim 
pending with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for among other ailments, sleep 
apnea, stress, fatigue, short term memory loss, and PTSD. (Tr. 94; AE A) 
 
Applicant is a youth minister. (Tr. 91) He is active in his church. (Tr. 91) He 
belongs to a Christian motorcycle group. (Tr. 91-92) He takes his job seriously, and he

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the

facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative;  
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable 
behavior . . . ; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . ; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, 
professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in 
any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in 
the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the 
foreign security or intelligence service or other group. 
 
All five conditions apply. In November 2004, Applicant used cocaine, tested 
positive for cocaine on his employer’s urinalysis test, and was fired for using cocaine. In 
October 2007, he was fired for a safety violation. In March 2010, he was arrested and 
charged with communication of a threat. On his July 16, 2008 SF 86, he failed to 
disclose: (1) his discharge from the Army with a characterization of service of OTH; (2) 
his firings from his employment in November 2004 and October 2007; (3) his November 
2004 cocaine use; and (4) his debts currently delinquent more than 90 days. On 
October 21, 2008, he lied to an OPM investigator about the reason he was fired in 
November 2004.    
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
AG ¶¶ 17(a), 17(b), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) do not apply to a sufficient degree to 
mitigate any SOR allegations. AG ¶ 17(c) applies to the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
and 1.d. The most recent event was his firing in October 2007 for a safety violation, and 
this conduct has a low level of culpability, as the damage was not intentional or 
associated with substance abuse. These three events are unlikely to recur and no 
longer cast doubt on Applicant’s trustworthiness. AG ¶ 17(f) applies to SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 
1.i. Applicant was never tried for communicating a threat, and there is insufficient 
credible evidence that Applicant sincerely intended bodily harm to anyone. The charge 
was dismissed without going to trial. Applicant’s failure to disclose debts that are 
currently delinquent more than 90 days or delinquent more than 180 days in the 
previous seven years on his July 16, 2008 SF-86 is unsubstantiated. Applicant’s claim 
that he was unaware of such debts is credible. There are only six delinquent debts 
alleged, and they total less than $1,500. He moved more than once and his mail 
seeking payment for the debts may not have been forwarded to him. Most of his 
accounts are current, and he does not appear to have financial problems.   
 
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the following derogatory information on 
his July 16, 2008 SF-86: (1) his discharge from the Army with a characterization of 
service of OTH; (2) his firings from his employment in November 2004 and October 
2007; and (3) his November 2004 cocaine use. On October 21, 2008, he deliberately 
lied to an OPM investigator about the true reason he was fired in November 2004 
(cocaine use). He was not credible at his hearing about why he did not disclose this 
information (his primary explanation was “oversight”). No one misled him into thinking 
this information should not be reported on his SF-86. The questions are clear, and his 
good character evidence shows that he is an intelligent person. He did not forget about 
his OTH discharge, his firings, the reasons he was fired, and his cocaine use. His false 
statements on his SF-86 and to the OPM investigator are serious and relatively recent. 
Personal conduct concerns are not mitigated.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline E, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. He served in the Army on active duty 
from 1983 to 1986, and he received an honorable discharge. He joined the Army 
Reserve and served on active duty in Operation Desert Shield/Storm as a medic. From 
early 1987 to 2006, he served in the Army Reserve, and achieved the rank of staff 
sergeant. During his Army service, he received one ASR, one NDSM, two AAMs, one 
GCM, and two OSRs. He now suffers from PTSD and other ailments. He supports his 
son, church, community, and employer. He is a 47-year-old supervisor of security 
personnel working for a defense contractor, who has been successfully employed by his 
employer for five years. Several character statements laud his dedication, performance 
and character. His awards for his Army service and several certificates of appreciation, 
training, and commendation are important mitigation. There is no evidence of security 
violations. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his 
employer.  
 
When Applicant denied that he tested positive for illegal drug use, he conceded 
that he was “being deceitful to myself” because he “was trying to get a job.” He 
regretted not providing correct information to the OPM investigator. He agreed with 
Department Counsel’s characterization that he lied to the investigator. His admission 
that he lied to the OPM investigator is an important step on the road to rehabilitation. I 
give Applicant substantial credit for explaining and mitigating the majority of the SOR 
allegations, and for presenting strong evidence of his good character. These factors 
show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. He has not mitigated his deliberate and intentional falsification of his 
July 16, 2008 SF-86 or his October 21, 2008 OPM personal subject interview. He knew 
he should have disclosed: (1) his discharge from the Army with a characterization of 
service of OTH; (2) his firings from his employment in November 2004 and October 
2007; (3) his November 2004 cocaine use; and (4) his firing in November 2004 for using 
cocaine. He deliberately chose not to disclose this derogatory information on his July 
16, 2008 SF-86 and to the OPM investigator on October 21, 2008. His explanations that 
these omissions were due to oversight, memory loss, being forgetful, PTSD, or 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
depression are not credible and weigh against rehabilitation and mitigation of the 
personal conduct disqualifying conditions.       
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude personal conduct concerns 
are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d to 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
