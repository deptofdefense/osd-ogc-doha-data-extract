GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 5, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On October 27, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on November 17, 2011.2 On January 6, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December

29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 18, 2012. In a notarized 
statement, dated February 2, 2012,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
April 5, 2012, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after 
receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on April 19, 2012. He timely submitted 
additional documents and other information to which there was no objection. The case 
was assigned to me on May 24, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, portions of 
seven of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.g.). He denied portions of those seven factual allegations as well as three 
other factual allegations in their entirety (SOR ¶¶ 1.h. through 1.j.). Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of two defense contractors. He has been 
serving as a security officer with one company since January 2010, and with the other 
company since July 2010.4 He was previously employed as a cashier from January 
2000 until July 2010.5 He has never served with the U.S. military,6 and has never held a 
security clearance.7 The record is silent regarding Applicant’s employment status or 
activities between 1978 and 2000. Applicant graduated from high school in November 
1972.8 He graduated from a teacher’s college in August 1978.9 Applicant was married in

August 1982, and June 1986.11  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2008 when he 
first started having financial problems, and began falling behind on his various 
payments.12 He attributed it to several factors: he was not making as much money; he 
was supporting his children; and “the rising cost of living in the area.”13 As a result of his 
delayed payments, accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or 
charged off. One account went to judgment. In May 2010, Applicant sought the 
professional guidance and assistance of a consumer debt counselor, and consolidated 
his debts with that company, and engaged the services of a contractual payment 
service.14 In September 2010, he enrolled three accounts in the program.15  
 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies. Three of those 
accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e.) refer to the same bank accounts in different 
stages of development. Two of the accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e.) were for loans 
obtained from the same bank at different times,16 and appear in an August 2010 credit 
report as three separate entries with three different account numbers, and two different 
balances.17 The account in SOR ¶ 1.d. reflects a balance of $8,599 that was charged off 
in June 2010,18 as well as an unpaid balance of $8,327 that was 180 days past due as 
of July 2010.19 An October 2011 credit report reflects the account as having been 
charged off, with a balance of $4,524,20 the amount listed in the SOR. In the August 
2010 credit report, the account in SOR ¶ 1.e. reflects an unpaid balance of $8,599 that

was 180 days or more past due as of February 2010.21 The October 2011 credit report 
reflects the account as being 180 or more days past due, with an unpaid balance of 
$2,013,22 the amount listed in the SOR.  
 
Applicant contends that those two accounts were merged in July 2010, when the 
bank filed and obtained a small claims judgment in the amount of $11,920 (SOR ¶ 
1.a.).23 Applicant and the bank attorneys agreed to a repayment plan under which 
Applicant is to make a monthly payment of $286.24 He has continued to make his 
monthly payments.25 As of November 4, 2011, the unpaid balance, including judgment 
principal, accrued interest, attorney’s fees, and court costs, was $9,699.03.26 As of 
January 4, 2012, the unpaid balance, including judgment principal, accrued interest, 
attorney’s fees, and court costs, was $9,254.41.27 As of May 2012, Applicant contends 
his remaining balance is less than $8,000.28 It is Applicant’s intention to increase his 
monthly payments to $600 now that other accounts have been satisfied.29 Applicant’s 
actions related to the three alleged accounts reflect he is making progress in resolving 
the accounts. 
  
There is a bank credit card account that was 150 days past due in the amount of 
$3,46330 (SOR ¶ 1.b.). The account was charged off in June 2010.31 This account was 
one of those enrolled in his debt consolidation with his consumer debt counselor.32 The 
creditor settled the account for $1,065, provided monthly payments were received, and 
monthly payments of $125 were made starting in November 2011, and continuing 
through at least March 2012.33 Applicant’s actions related to the account reflect he is 
making progress in resolving the account.

There is a bank credit card account with a high credit of $5,075 that became 
delinquent and was charged off and then sold to another entity.34 That collection 
company increased the unpaid balance to $5,148.35 The unpaid balance was 
subsequently increased to $5,505 (SOR ¶ 1.c.).36 This account was one of those 
enrolled in his debt consolidation with his consumer debt counselor.37 The collection 
company reduced the balance to $5,075.81, provided monthly payments were 
received.38 Applicant made the initial payment of $1,700 on October 21, 2011, as well 
as subsequent $148 monthly payments, with several more remaining, continuing 
through at least March 2012.39 Applicant’s actions related to the account reflect he is 
making progress in resolving the account. 
 
There is a bank credit card account that was 180 days past due in the amount of 
$82340 (SOR ¶ 1.f.). The account was charged off in May 2010.41 This account was one 
of those enrolled in his debt consolidation with his consumer debt counselor.42 The 
consumer debt counselor and the creditor settled the account for $301.95 on January 
28, 2011,43 provided one lump-sum payment was timely received.44 Applicant made the 
payment on January 28, 2011.45 The account has been resolved. 
 
There are two medical accounts with unidentified service providers. One account, 
with a balance of $185, was placed for collection in February 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.g.).46 The 
other account, with a balance of $101 (SOR ¶ 1.h.), was placed for collection in May 
2009.47 Applicant denied that the larger account was still unresolved, and contended it 
was settled and resolved in 2006 when he paid the creditor $187.48 He stated that his 
payment was confirmed by a letter that was supposedly attached to his Answer to the

SOR,49 but there was no such attachment found. He had previously indicated that the 
accounts were actually one account that had been handled by separate collection 
agencies, and had been settled, but acknowledged that he no longer had proof of 
payment.50 In fact, he was correct. Despite the account being listed twice in his August 
2010 credit report under different creditors, with different account numbers, and different 
balances,51 one of the collection agents confirmed that the two accounts were actually 
only one account.52 The unpaid balance was $100.80, and once the payment was 
received, the other collection agent would be notified that the account had been paid in 
full.53 The other collection agent subsequently confirmed that the account had been 
paid.54 Both accounts have been resolved. 
 
There is an unspecified account with a collection agency with a past due balance 
of $88 that was placed for collection in February 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.i.).55 Applicant 
contends that the account is actually the same as the two medical accounts previously 
discussed, and based his contention on a telephone discussion he had with the 
representative of one of the collection agents.56 He has not submitted any 
documentation, other than his own handwritten note, confirming his contention. 
Although the account was listed in the August 2010 credit report,57 it no longer appears 
in the October 2011 credit report.58 Based on the available evidence, I conclude that the 
account has been resolved. 
 
There purportedly is an account with a cable company in the approximate 
amount of $173 that was placed for collection. Applicant denied ever having an account 
with the particular creditor,59 and claimed that when he called the creditor on several 
occasions, they indicated they had no record of an account in Applicant’s name.60 The 
account does not appear in the August 2010 credit report, a February 2011 credit 
report,61 or in the October 2011 credit report. I conclude the Government has failed to

offer any evidence that the account exists, and in light of Applicant’s denials, the issue 
is resolved in favor of Applicant. 
 
As of September 2010, with an improved income, Applicant’s financial status was 
considered to be otherwise stable, and he was capable of meeting his financial 
obligations.62  Applicant intends to continue his repayment arrangements, and make 
larger payments when he is able to do so, until all of his accounts are resolved.63  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”64 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”65   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”66 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.67  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”68 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”69 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in about 2008 when 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or went to 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@70  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. Applicant’s financial problems commenced 
in 2008 when he began falling behind on his various payments. He attributed his 
financial problems to several factors: he was not making as much money; he was 
supporting his children; and “the rising cost of living in the area.” Applicant’s financial 
difficulties were in some small measure beyond his control, considering the nature of 
the overall national economic conditions and his insufficient income, and occurred under

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.71  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. In May 2010, well before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant was addressing his financial difficulties when he sought the professional 
guidance and assistance of a consumer debt counselor, and consolidated his debts with 
that company, and engaged the services of a contractual payment service. While the 
specifics of the “financial counseling” he received were not enumerated, it is clear that 
he received counseling related to debt management, debt consolidation, and debt 
repayment, etc. Commencing in 2010, some accounts were settled with the assistance 
of his consumer debt counselor, and he followed the guidance received, and has 
continued to make his monthly payments to his contractual payment service, which in 
turn has been making monthly payments to his remaining creditors. Circumstances may 
have been such that Applicant was unable to resolve all of his accounts by bringing 
them up-to-date or resolving them before the SOR was issued, but he did do so with 
several of his accounts. His failure with respect to his remaining accounts was not for 
lack of trying.72  
  
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a 
credit report without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit 
bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and 
“other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for 
concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, 
an individual’s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, 
the combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax credit report and the Equifax credit 
reports referred to numerous creditors for relatively few delinquent accounts. Because 
of abbreviated names and acronyms, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, 
and have inflated the financial concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
                                                          
71
 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
72
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He allowed several 
accounts to become delinquent, and they were either placed for collection, charged off, 
or went to judgment. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2008 when he began falling behind on his 
various payments because: he was not making as much money; he was supporting his 
children; and “the rising cost of living in the area.” Those financial difficulties were in 
some small measure beyond his control, and occurred under such circumstances that 
they are unlikely to recur. In May 2010, Applicant addressed his financial difficulties 
when he sought the professional guidance and assistance of a consumer debt 
counselor, and consolidated his debts with that company, and engaged the services of 
a contractual payment service. Some accounts were settled with the assistance of his 
consumer debt counselor, and he has continued to make his monthly payments to his 
contractual payment service, which in turn has been making monthly payments to his 
remaining creditors. Applicant’s efforts pertaining to his delinquent accounts have been 
unrelenting, and have eliminated any doubt as to his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment.  Moreover, several of the accounts alleged in the SOR are duplicates 
of other accounts alleged in the SOR. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case 
in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.73 Applicant’s continuing good-faith efforts have been extensive, and are 
sufficient to mitigate security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:74 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
                                                          
73
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
