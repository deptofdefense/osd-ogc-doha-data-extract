LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 8, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2012, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 1, 2012. DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing on May 18, 2011, scheduling the hearing for June 12, 2012. The 
hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were 
 
2 
 
admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s 
Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the 
hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 19, 2012.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since March 2010. He is applying for a security clearance for the 
first time. He attended college for a period but did not obtain a degree. He is married 
with two adult children and two minor children.1 
  
 Applicant has had financial issues for a number of years. He and his wife filed 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1994, and their debts were discharged in 1995. He stated that 
he was laid off from work on a number of occasions between 1984 and 1999.2  
 
 Applicant bought a house in about 1999. Applicant testified that he paid about 
$185,000. Credit reports show a mortgage of $152,140. If there was a second 
mortgage, it is no longer on his credit report. He refinanced the mortgage on several 
occasions. Credit reports show a $191,900 mortgage that was opened in 2001, followed 
by a $242,250 mortgage that was opened in 2002, and a $300,000 mortgage that was 
opened in December 2004. One of the refinances was in order to build a swimming 
pool.3 
 
 Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2004. The bankruptcy 
petition listed $257,000 in secured claims and $12,370 in unsecured claims. Their debts 
were discharged in November 2004. Applicant stated that his second bankruptcy was 
also related to sporadic employment and lay-offs. He has had stable employment since 
2004.4  
 
 Credit reports indicate that Applicant refinanced again with a $406,000 mortgage 
that was opened in 2005. Applicant stated that the equity obtained from his last 
refinance was to use as a down payment on his “dream house,” which he purchased in 
2005 for $650,000. He stated that he paid for the house with the $100,000 obtained 
from the last refinance of his first house and a $550,000 mortgage. Credit reports show 
a $557,439 mortgage that was opened in November 2005 and closed in September 
2006. He refinanced the mortgage, with a $675,000 mortgage that was opened in 
September 2006.5

 Applicant bought his second house before he sold his first house. The real estate 
market was still booming, and he hoped to sell it quickly. Applicant was unable to sell 
the first house, and he could not afford either mortgage. He stopped paying the 
mortgages. After about a year, he moved back into the first house. He moved to a 
nearby state with a lower cost of living in 2007. He lost the second house to foreclosure 
in 2007. The holder of the mortgage issued an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 
1099-A (Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property) for tax year 2007. The form 
indicated that the lender acquired the property on August 13, 2007. The balance of the 
principal on the mortgage at that time was listed as $675,000, and the fair market value 
of the property was listed at $734,362. He lost the first house to foreclosure in about 
2008.6   
 
 Applicant did not receive an accounting from the mortgage companies indicating 
what the mortgage companies received for the houses when they were sold or 
auctioned. He believes the mortgage company sold his second house for between 
$450,000 and $550,000. He does not know how much the mortgage company received 
for his first house. He has not received an IRS form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) for 
either property. The mortgage companies have never contacted him attempting to 
collect any deficiency owed on the mortgages.7  
 
 Applicant bought a pickup truck in November 2006 that was financed through a 
$33,170 loan. SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of $11,473 for the deficiency on the 
loan for the pickup truck after it was voluntarily repossessed in about December 2010. 
Applicant stated that his wife was making less money in their new location. He still 
worked in the state where they used to live, and he commuted between states until he 
was hired by his current employer in 2010. Applicant took out a loan to settle this debt 
and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. He negotiated to settle the pickup truck loan for 
$7,102, which he paid in about May 2011. Credit reports continue to list a $3,766 
balance, but I am convinced the $7,102 was paid as a settlement for the full amount.8 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a delinquent debt of $8,646 for a loan Applicant took out in 
about 2006 to buy carpeting for his first house. He was unable to maintain the 
payments, and the loan became delinquent in 2010. Applicant settled the debt in about 
June 2011.9 
 
 Applicant has never received financial counseling, but he stated that his finances 
are currently in better shape. He has stable employment in the area where he lives, and 
he testified that he has “learned a lesson on housing.” He bought a house in 2009 for 
about $210,000. He is current on his mortgage payments and his other accounts.10

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19. 
Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;  
 
  Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment before he 
obtained stable employment in 2004. His employment problems qualify as conditions 
 
6 
 
that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that the 
individual act responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
  Applicant’s debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 1995. He bought a house in 
about 1999. He refinanced his mortgage on several occasions, once to build a 
swimming pool. He again filed bankruptcy, and his debts were discharged in 2004. In 
2005, he again refinanced in order to obtain a down payment on his “dream house,” 
which he purchased for $650,000, before selling his first home. He refinanced the 
mortgage on his second home, with a $675,000 mortgage that was opened in 
September 2006. He bought a pickup truck in November 2006 that was financed 
through a $33,170 loan.  
 
  Applicant lost both houses to foreclosure and his pickup truck was voluntarily 
repossessed. He borrowed money and paid $7,102 to settle the deficiency owed on the 
loan for the pickup truck, and he settled another delinquent debt. When the mortgage 
company obtained the second property, the fair market value of the property was listed 
on IRS form 1099-A at $734,362, which was $59,362 more than the $675,000 balance 
of the principal on the mortgage. There is no indication that the mortgage companies 
are attempting to collect any deficiencies that might be owed on the mortgages, and the 
state has an anti-deficiency statute.11 Applicant has not received financial counseling, 
but he stated that his finances are in better shape and he is paying all his current 
obligations. 
 
I find that Applicant has a history of making questionable financial decisions. I am 
unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a 
good-faith effort to pay his debts.12 His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am 
unable to determine that they are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) 
                                                          
11 See ISCR Case No. 10-07393 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun.12, 2012): 
 
Even if a delinquent debt is unenforceable under state law, a Judge must consider the 
facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to 
satisfy the debt in a timely manner.  
 
12 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or an anti-deficiency statute]) in order to claim the benefit of [good-faith 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
 
are not applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. I find that financial concerns 
remain despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant’s financial history includes two bankruptcies, two foreclosures, and a 
repossessed pickup truck. He settled one debt, and he paid $7,102 as a settlement for 
the pickup truck loan deficiency. It is unlikely that he will ever be sued for any 
deficiencies on his foreclosed mortgages. Applicant’s finances may be currently on 
track. However, his history of questionable financial decisions raises doubts that he can 
keep them on track.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  Against Applicant 
 
8 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
