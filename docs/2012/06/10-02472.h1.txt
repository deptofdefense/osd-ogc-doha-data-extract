GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 4, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On October 20, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on November 16, 2010.2 On April 5, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR, and there is no explanation 
in the file as to why another copy of the SOR was sent to him, re-dated December 7, 
2011. Nevertheless, Applicant acknowledged receipt of the second SOR on December 
27, 2011. In a sworn statement, dated January 11, 2012, Applicant responded to the 
SOR allegations.3 In a subsequent e-mail, he elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on April 2, 2012, and he was afforded an 
opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM 
on April 12, 2012, but as of June 21, 2012, he had not submitted any information or 
documents. The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nine (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e., and 1.g. 
through 1.j.) of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR. 
Although he denied the remaining two allegations (¶¶ 1.f. and 1.k.), he based his 
denials on his contention that one was actually a duplicate of another account listed in 
the SOR, and one may have been reported in error. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor.5 He served with the 
U.S. Navy from September 1989 until December 1990, and was discharged with a 
General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions.6 He has never held a security 
clearance.7 It is unclear if Applicant graduated from high school, as his SF 86 is silent in 
                                                          
3
 Item 4 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated January 11, 2012). 
 
4
 Item 4 (E-mail, dated January 25, 2012). Applicant was the subject of a criminal investigation conducted by 
the U.S. Naval Investigative Service (NCIS) in early 1990, and he admitted stealing money from the wallet and locker 
of two other individuals in violation of Article 121, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). See Item 9 (NCIS Report 
of Investigation, dated March 7, 1990). The connection between his actions and the characterization of his eventual 
discharge was not further explained.

that regard. He attended a vocational, technical, or trade school from November 2000 
until April 2001, and received certifications as a Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate 
and a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert.8 Applicant has held a variety of positions with 
different employers over the years. He was a technician from July 1997 until April 2003, 
an IT manager from May 2003 until May 2004, a field systems engineer from May 2004 
until October 2005, a network engineer from October 2005 until March 2006, an IT 
manager from March 2006 until August 2007, a network monitor technician from 
October 2007 until December 2007, a network technician from February 2008 until April 
2008, a, IT systems specialist from April 2008 until September 2008, a data technician 
and then an install technician from September 2008 until January 2009, a data 
technician from January 2009 until February 2009, an IT manager from June 2009 until 
September 2009, a self-employed team lead in October 2009, and a part-time court 
runner and office clerk from September 2009 until November 2009. He was also 
unemployed from December 2007 until February 2008.9 He joined his current employer 
in November 2009 in an unspecified position as “federal contractor.” 10 
 
Applicant was married in April 1997 and divorced in September 2007.11 He 
married his second wife in December 2007 and they divorced in August 2009.12 Except 
for a comment in November 2010 about a “newborn son,”13 the record is silent 
regarding children. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2004. He 
attributed his financial problems to “low compensatory employment, poor money 
management, his failed marriage, and/or his initial unawareness of the debt.”14 He has 
held several odd or low-paying jobs since 2004, and although he tried to be frugal, his 
expenses “exponentially” increased and surpassed his income.15 During 2007 and 
2008, he admitted he was “living beyond [his] means.”16 He experienced periods of 
unemployment, his wife was spending too much money, and he moved out of state for 
personal reasons.17 As a result, accounts started to become delinquent, and were 
placed for collection or charged off.18

In November 2010, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting 
a net monthly income of $2,631.92.19 He claimed $2,325 in monthly expenses, as well 
as zero debt payments.20 He had $396.92 left over each month for discretionary 
spending or savings.  
 
In December 2009, Applicant indicated he would contact his creditors or 
collection agencies to determine his financial responsibilities and satisfy his debts in full 
by the end of 2012.21 He stated he had no intention of filing for bankruptcy, and 
contended his present financial situation was stable and improved.22 As of December 
2009, Applicant had not sought any financial counseling.23 In November 2010, he 
admitted he had not made payment arrangements because his financial situation had 
changed, making it “currently impossible.”24 He was also considering the possibility of 
bankruptcy.25 
 
The SOR identified 11 purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $50,880. A closer review and analysis of the SOR allegations and 
Applicant’s credit reports reveals that four of the accounts reflected in the SOR (SOR 
&& 1.d., 1.e., 1.h., and 1.k.) are actually the same account, simply under different 
creditor or collection agent names, with different account numbers, in different stages of 
collection.26 The account, regardless of which creditor or collection agent is identified, 
has not been addressed or resolved. None of the remaining accounts listed in the SOR, 
as well as in the various credit reports, have been addressed or resolved.27 Applicant

 Special attention was focused on the following sources: Item 8, wherein TransUnion lists an account with 
a national department store as 150 days past due with a balance of $5,903 (at 10), as listed in SOR & 1.k.; Equifax 
lists an account with a furniture store with a balance of $5,093 as 180 days past due and charged off (at 5), as listed 
in SOR & 1.d.); Item 7 (2010 credit report), wherein Equifax lists one account with the same furniture store in the 
amount of $5,093 that was charged off (at 1), as listed in SOR & 1.d.); and separately with a collection agent with a 
high credit of $5,903 and a balance of $7,341 (at 1), as listed in SOR & 1.h.; Item 7 (2011 credit report), wherein 
Equifax lists one account with the same furniture store in the amount of $5,093 that was charged off (at 1), as listed in 
SOR & 1.d.); and separately with a collection agent with a high credit of $7,295 and an unpaid balance of $7,453 (at 
1), as listed in SOR & 1.e.

claims he has attempted to contact some creditors, has e-mailed other creditors, or is 
working on payment arrangements with other creditors, but he has submitted no 
documentary evidence to support his claims. There is no evidence that Applicant made 
any effort to resolve these accounts, and they remain unresolved. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”28 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”29   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”30 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.31  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”32 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”33 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Commencing as early as 2004, and intensifying in 2007 and 2008, 
Applicant found himself unable to continue making his monthly payments. His accounts 
started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or sold to other 
collectors. His financial difficulties remain unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@34  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative 
recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 2004 make it difficult to 
conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” There is no evidence to 
indicate Applicant has ever received counseling in money management, debt 
management, debt repayment, or budgeting. There is no evidence to indicate that 
Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
his debts. Applicant’s continuing statements regarding his future intent to resolve his 
debts, without corroborating documentary evidence, are entitled to little weight.35 His 
declaration of future intention to resolve his debts, after so much time where no positive 
efforts were taken, does not qualify as a “good-faith” effort.  
 
                                                          
34
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant attributed his financial problems to “low 
compensatory employment, poor money management, his failed marriage, and/or his 
initial unawareness of the debt.” But, he also admitted he was “living beyond [his] 
means” in 2007 and 2008. He experienced periods of unemployment, his wife was 
spending too much money, and he moved out of state for unexplained personal 
reasons. While some of those reasons were largely beyond Applicant’s control (e.g., 
loss of employment, divorce, and separation), it is difficult to conclude that Applicant 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.36  
 
 In light of his substantial period of continuing financial problems, it is unlikely that 
they will be resolved in the short term, and they are likely to continue. Accordingly, 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under financial considerations, and 
under the circumstances, his actions do cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.37   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.38       
                                                          
36
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
9 
                                      
 
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: His financial 
difficulties were caused, in part, because of low salaries, unemployment, and a failing 
marriage.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial difficulties were also caused, in part, by living beyond his means in 
2007 and 2008. Applicant claimed he attempted to contact some creditors, e-mailed 
other creditors, or was working on payment arrangements with other creditors. He failed 
to submit any documentary evidence to support his claims, and there is no evidence 
that Applicant made any effort to resolve these accounts, and they remain unresolved. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:39 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
In this instance, Applicant has offered little evidence of efforts, other than promises, to 
resolve his delinquent debts, and his “meaningful track record” is not a satisfactory one. 
He has discussed bankruptcy before, and still entertains that possibility. Applicant could 
have made some reasonable timely efforts to resolve his accounts, but he has not done 
so. Applicant’s actions indicate poor self-control and a lack of judgment, which raise 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
