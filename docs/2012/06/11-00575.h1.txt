GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding drug involvement and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 11, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
EPSQ version of a Security Clearance Application (EPSQ).1 On June 17, 2010, 
Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).2 
On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
him a set of interrogatories. It is unclear when he responded to the interrogatories, for

 Government Exhibit 2 ((EPSQ), dated July 11, 2005). There is an unexplained inconsistency regarding the 
EPSQ. One entry indicates the form was signed on October 15, 2003 (at 1), but another entry indicates it was signed 
on “7-11-05,” which could mean November 5, 2007, July 11, 2005, or November 7, 2005 (at 6). In the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, the date July 11, 2005 has been designated the actual date.

he failed to sign the response.3 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on February 13, 2012.4 His 
response included an acknowledgment and response regarding the contents of the first 
set of interrogatories.5 DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him on March 
23, 2012, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why 
DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 28, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated April 6, 2012, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Department Counsel indicated that the Government was prepared to proceed on 
May 9, 2012, and the case was assigned to me on May 14, 2012. A Notice of Hearing 
was issued on May 17, 2012, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on June 11, 
2012. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through 4) and one Applicant 
exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and two 
witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 20, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, one (¶ 1.a.) of 
the factual allegations as well as a portion of another factual allegation (¶ 1.b.)  
pertaining to drug involvement of the SOR, and a portion of the factual allegation 
pertaining to personal conduct (¶ 2.a.) of the SOR. He denied the remaining allegations 
or portions thereof. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, from May 
2008, has served as a technician.6 He was previously employed in a variety of positions

including team lead, technician, product selector, pizza distributor, and loan officer.7 
Applicant has never served in the U.S. military.8 Although he denied ever receiving a 
security clearance,9 the facility security officer at the facility where Applicant worked until 
April 6, 2006, indicated that a security clearance was granted to Applicant, effective 
April 13, 2006.10 The previous security officer did not inform Applicant of the security 
clearance as Applicant had already left that employer.11 If Applicant had still been an 
employee of the company, he would have received the prescribed security briefing and 
signed an acknowledgment of his obligations.12 
 
Applicant has never been married.13 He has a daughter, born from a previous 
relationship in April 1997.14 A June 1989 high school graduate,15 Applicant attended a 
community college from September 1989 until May 1990, but never received a 
degree.16  
 
Drug Involvement 
 
During the period 1989 until August 2009, Applicant was a substance abuser 
whose choice of substances was marijuana.17 He first experimented with marijuana one 
time during “senior week after graduation” from high school.18 Thereafter, he sometimes 
did not use it for several months at a time, and at other times he used it about one time 
per week.19 There was no specific pattern for his frequency of use, and he characterized 
such use as sporadic.20 He used marijuana on an average of once a week or less from

October 2001 to approximately 2005, and once a month from approximately 2005 until 
August 2009.21 He used the marijuana generally while with friends at parties and social 
gatherings, but also alone at home.22 Applicant usually took two or three puffs from the 
marijuana cigarette at any given time.23 Applicant never purchased marijuana, but did, 
on about seven to ten occasions, contribute to the purchase of marijuana by someone 
else.24 He has never cultivated, manufactured, sold, or distributed marijuana or any 
other drug.25 Applicant’s use of marijuana made him feel “drained, hungry and tired.”26 
In August 2009, Applicant decided to stop using marijuana and he has abstained from 
using marijuana since that point.27 He is not proud of his past substance abuse, and has 
changed his behavior and attitude toward illegal drug use and made a conscious 
decision to avoid environments where it may occur.28 He no longer associates with the 
former friends who do continue to use marijuana.29 He intends to never use marijuana 
or any other drug in the future.30 Applicant has never been treated or diagnosed for 
using marijuana.31 
 
Personal Conduct 
  
On July 11, 2005, when Applicant completed and submitted his EPSQ, he 
responded to a question set forth therein. The SOR alleges Applicant falsified material 
facts when he deliberately failed to disclose that he had used marijuana, with varying 
frequency, between at least October 2001 and July 2005, in response to § 27: Your Use 
of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity. The question asked if Applicant had, since the age of 
16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, used a variety of illegal substances, 
including marijuana. Applicant answered “no” to the question.32 That response was 
false, for Applicant by his own admissions had been using marijuana for approximately

16 years before the date of the EPSQ, and he was still using it. He acknowledged the 
answer was a mistake made out of “some fear” of losing his job,33 but he still denied the 
response was deliberate or an attempt to falsify the material facts.34  
 
On June 17, 2010, when Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86, he 
responded to a similar question set forth therein. The question (§ 23 a: Illegal Use of 
Drugs or Drug Activity) asked if Applicant had, in the last 7 years, used a variety of 
illegal substances, including marijuana. Applicant answered “yes” to the question and 
added that he had used cannabis once a week from October 2001 until August 2009.35 
In response to another question that asked if he had done so while possessing a 
security clearance (§ 23 b), Applicant responded “no.”36 He denied the response was a 
deliberate attempt to falsify the material facts, and explained that he was not aware that 
he had previously been given a security clearance.37 
 
Character References 
 
 A coworker, who has periodically been Applicant’s supervisor and has known him 
since July 2000, as well as Applicant’s girlfriend, who has known him since the fall of 
2009 and cohabited with him since June 2010, are fully supportive of Applicant’s 
application. Both witnesses have security clearances. Applicant has been characterized 
as trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, honest, and very reliable.38 His girlfriend trusts 
Applicant with her life, and, since she has known him, has seen no evidence of any 
continuing substance abuse by him.39 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”40 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”41   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”42 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.43  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”44

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”45 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in 
AG & 24:      
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include: 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 
1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and 
(2) inhalants and other similar substances; 
(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a 
manner that deviates from approved medical direction. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 25(a), “any drug abuse (see above definition),” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 25(c), “illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,” may 
raise security concerns. Also, AG & 25(g) may apply when there is “any illegal drug use 
after being granted a security clearance.” During the period 1989 to August 2009, 
Applicant contributed to the purchase of marijuana on a number of occasions and used 
marijuana with varying frequency. AG ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) apply.  However, as to his use 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
45
 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7.

of marijuana after being granted a security clearance, technically that security clearance 
was approved, but since Applicant had already left the employ of his employer and he 
was never advised that the clearance had been granted or briefed on his 
responsibilities, the evidence fails to establish AG & 25(g). 
 The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG ¶ 26(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Under AG & 26(b), 
drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where there is “a demonstrated intent 
not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence.” 
Applicant’s substance abuse commenced when he experimented one time in 
1989 upon graduation from high school, and continued thereafter until August 2009. 
Sometimes he did not use it for several months at a time, and at other times he used it 
about one time per week. He admitted there was no specific pattern for his frequency of 
use. He used marijuana on an average of once a week or less from October 2001 to 
approximately 2005, and once a month from approximately 2005 until August 2009. He 
finally made a decision to stop using marijuana, and has abstained since August 2009. 
As noted above, Applicant has changed his behavior and attitude toward illegal drug 
use and made a conscious decision to avoid environments where it may occur; he no 
longer associates with the former friends who do continue to use marijuana; he is not 
proud of his substance abuse; and he intends to never use marijuana or any other drug 
in the future. He has exhibited an understanding of the significance of holding a security 
clearance. Considering his period of abstinence, his continuing social and professional 
relationships, and his new appreciation of the illegality of marijuana use, his behavior is 
unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  AG ¶¶ 26(a) and 26(b) apply. 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
9 
                                      
 
 
The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), security concerns may be raised when there is a: 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.”  
 
Applicant’s response to the inquiry in his 2005 EPSQ of critical information 
pertaining to marijuana use provides sufficient evidence to examine if his submission 
was a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of 
misunderstanding or a mistake made out of “some fear” of losing his job, as he also 
contends. He denied the false response was deliberate or an attempt to falsify the 
material facts. Considering the inconsistencies in Applicant’s positions, AG ¶ 16(a) has 
been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(a) may apply if “the individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before 
being confronted with the facts.” If “the offense is so minor, or so much time has 
passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” AG ¶ 17(c) may apply. Also, AG ¶ 17(d) 
may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, 
circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate 
behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.” Similarly, if “the individual has taken 
positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or 
duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. 
 
In June 2010, before the Government knew of his marijuana abuse and before 
he could be confronted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM), Applicant answered a similar question in his SF 86 truthfully. In 
July 2010, and again in October 2011, when Applicant was interviewed by OPM, he 
again answered the questions truthfully. Applicant has been characterized as honest 
and trustworthy by those who know him well. His action in 2005 – seven years ago – in 
responding falsely to the inquiry regarding marijuana use was clearly aberrant and out 
of character for him. Applicant subsequently changed his lifestyle and made a 
conscious decision to avoid environments where drug abuse may occur. The stressors, 
circumstances, and factors that led to his aberrant behavior in making the false 
response are unlikely to recur because he has clearly taken positive steps to reduce or 
eliminate any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶¶ 17(a), 17(c), 
17(d), and 17(e) apply.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.46       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He used 
marijuana from 1989 until August 2009, and in 2005, when asked if had ever used 
marijuana, he lied and said no. (See AG & 2(a)(8).)   
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant was a substance abuser who finally made a decision to stop using marijuana, 
and has abstained since August 2009. He changed his behavior and attitude and made 
a conscious decision to avoid environments where marijuana use may occur. He 
stopped associating with the former friends who do continue to use marijuana. He is not 
proud of his substance abuse, and he intends to never use marijuana or any other drug 
in the future. Considering his period of abstinence, his continuing social and professional 
relationships, and his new appreciation of the illegality of marijuana use, his behavior 
related to substance abuse is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. With respect to his personal 
conduct, Applicant’s response to the inquiry in his 2005 EPSQ was both a deliberate 
falsification, as alleged in the SOR, as well as a mistake made out of some fear of losing 
his job. Nevertheless, he denied the false response was deliberate or an attempt to 
falsify the material facts. In June 2010, before the Government knew of his marijuana 
abuse and before he could be confronted by OPM, Applicant answered a similar 
question in his SF 86 truthfully. In July 2010, and again in October 2011, when Applicant 
was interviewed by OPM, he again answered the questions truthfully. According to those 
who know him well, Applicant is honest and trustworthy. His action seven years ago in

responding falsely to the inquiry regarding marijuana use was clearly aberrant and out of 
character for him. Applicant subsequently changed his lifestyle and made a conscious 
decision to avoid environments where drug abuse may occur. Under the evidence 
presented, I have no questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability 
to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
Formal Findings 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline H:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
   
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 2.b:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
