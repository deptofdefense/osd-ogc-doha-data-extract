GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding criminal conduct 
and financial considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 13, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the 
interrogatories on August 23, 2011.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued her a 
set of interrogatories. She responded to those interrogatories on August 23, 2011.3 On

December 7, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns 
under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 13, 2011. In a written 
statement, notarized but undated, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on February 28, 2012, and the case was 
assigned to me on March 2, 2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 14, 2012, 
and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on April 3, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, eight Government exhibits (GE 1-8) and two Applicant 
exhibits (AE A-B) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one 
other witness testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the only factual allegation 
pertaining to criminal conduct (¶ 1.a.) of the SOR, as well as several of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial obligations (¶¶ 2.a., 2.i., and 2.j.) of the SOR. 
Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the 
remaining allegations (¶¶ 2.b. through 2.h., and 2.k. through 2.m.) of the SOR. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a financial analyst.4 She is seeking to obtain a security clearance. She has never 
previously held a security clearance.5 An August 1990 high school graduate,6 she has 
been enrolled in several colleges and universities over the years and received an

associate degree in an unspecified discipline in July 2010.7 Applicant has never served 
with the U.S. military.8 
 
While in high school, Applicant worked part-time as a cashier at a fast-food 
restaurant, and earned money baby-sitting. Following graduation, she held a variety of 
positions with different organizations. She was a counter-person at a jewelry store from 
November 1990 until late 1993; a dispatcher for a trucking company from 1993 until late 
1996; an administrative assistant for a medical center from 1997 until 1999; a human 
resources assistant for an advertising agency from 1999 until 2000; an executive 
assistant for an investment firm from 2000 until 2001; an administrative assistant for a 
non-profit foundation from May 2001 until July 2005; and a financial analyst with two 
different companies form October 2005 until October 2006 and from October 2006 until 
January 2011. She joined her current employer in January 2011.9 She also went 
through a period of voluntary unemployment (July 2005 to October 2005) while moving 
from one city to another.10  
 
Applicant was married the first time in August 1995, and divorced in May 2004.11 
She and her first husband had two daughters, born in July 1993 and August 1996, 
respectively.12 As part of the divorce, she was awarded physical custody of both 
children, while both parents shared legal custody.13 Applicant married her second 
husband in June 2004.14 She and her second husband separated in April 2009, but 
reconciled in September 2010.15  
 
Criminal Conduct 
 
In June 2009, while separated from her husband, Applicant met another 
individual (Ralph), who told her that he had been falsely accused of sodomy with a 16-
year-old female when he was 30 years old, and that he was fighting the charges.16 
Applicant attempted to verify his story with the state police, but could not do so because

the records were sealed.17 She spoke with Ralph’s mother, sister, and pastor, and they 
all agreed that Ralph was wrongly accused.18 She accepted their comments and was 
inclined to believe Ralph because he had two daughters and granddaughters.19 She 
also confirmed with a state trooper that Ralph had no restrictions.20 Applicant began 
dating Ralph in November 2009.21 In May 2010, Applicant left her youngest daughter 
alone to drive her older daughter from church. Ralph came over to her house 
unannounced and asked the younger child if he could paint her toes. She agreed. While 
he was painting her toes, Ralph pulled the child’s foot to his groin two times when she 
objected. He stopped the entire process.22 Applicant was not aware of the situation until 
the child told social services in August 2010.23  
 
Applicant’s ex-husband, her sister, and mother, learned of the episode as well as 
Ralph’s true status as a sex offender. They informed the authorities, while keeping 
Applicant in the dark about it. Subsequently, Ralph was arrested in August 2010 for 
violation of his restrictions related to being around children.24 Despite what Applicant 
had previously been told about him, Ralph had, in fact, molested young girls on three 
other occasions, and he was a designated sex offender with restrictions.25  
 
In June 2011, Applicant was charged with two counts each of gross, wanton, or 
reckless care for child, reduced to contributing to delinquency, abuse of child, commonly 
referred to as contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor.26 She was 
arrested a week later. Custody of the children was taken from Applicant and given to 
her ex-husband.27 Applicant eventually entered a plea of guilty, and in July 2011, she 
was sentenced to a total of 24 months in jail, with 24 months suspended, two years of 
supervised probation, completion of a parenting class, participation in individual or 
family counseling, and payment of court costs. Moreover, the Court ordered her to have 
no contact with her younger child until deemed appropriate by Applicant’s treating 
therapist or the court, and to have no contact with her older child until deemed

classes in July 2011, and successfully completed the parenting program in September 
2011.29 Applicant’s supervised probation ends in July 2013, unless terminated earlier by 
the court. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2002. Although 
Applicant’s divorce took place in May 2004, Applicant claims she was separated and 
going through a divorce from her first husband at the time and was earning as little as 
$25,000 to $27,000 per year. His debts supposedly became her debts.30 She was 
supporting herself and her two daughters, and was unable to make her monthly 
payments. Accounts became delinquent. On February 8, 2002, she filed for bankruptcy 
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and on May 15, 2002, her 36 debts, with 
an unspecified total balance, were discharged.31 Following the discharge of her debts, 
Applicant was debt-free. Nevertheless, within a few short years, Applicant’s financial 
situation began to deteriorate once again. Accounts became delinquent and were 
placed for collection or charged off, a vehicle was voluntarily repossessed, and tax liens 
were filed. 
 
In August 2011, nearly four months before the SOR was issued, Applicant 
engaged the professional services of a credit repair company to assist her in resolving 
14 of her delinquent accounts.32 The company disputed those accounts purportedly 
because they were either outstanding or outdated on her credit report, and was 
prepared to work on settlements for each of the accounts.33 Several accounts were 
apparently resolved as a result of the dispute process, but Applicant has not submitted 
any documentation to reflect payments to creditors by the company. 
 
The SOR identified 12 delinquent accounts in collection and one deficiency 
related to the repossession of a vehicle, in the total amount of approximately $15,648, 
as reflected by three credit reports. Those accounts listed in the SOR, and their 
respective current status, according to the evidence, are properly consolidated and 
categorized, as follows: those which are not resolved, and those which have been 
resolved.

Among those accounts which have not been resolved are the following: There is 
a medical account for an unspecified medical provider, in the amount of $100 (SOR ¶ 
2.b.), that was placed for collection with a collection attorney.34 The account was initially 
disputed because Applicant did not recognize it.35 As of February 16, 2012, an 
investigation by the credit reporting agency was in progress.36 She subsequently 
contended the account had been paid, and referred me to a letter from a collection 
attorney.37 Her contention is erroneous, for the letter actually refers to another 
delinquent medical account, discussed below (SOR ¶ 2.e.). There is no evidence that 
the delinquent $100 account has been resolved. 
 
There is an unspecified account with a partially identified bank in the amount of 
$966 (SOR ¶ 2.c.), that was placed for collection with a collection agency.38 The 
account was initially disputed because Applicant claimed it did not belong to her.39 As of 
August 5, 2011, an investigation by the credit reporting agency was in progress.40 
However, a subsequent Equifax credit report restored the listing as unpaid.41 There is 
no evidence that the delinquent account has been resolved. 
 
There is a medical account for an unspecified medical provider in the amount of 
$100 (SOR ¶ 2.d.), that was placed for collection.42 The account was initially disputed 
because Applicant did not owe anything.43 As of August 5, 2011, an investigation by the 
credit reporting agency was in progress.44 She subsequently contended the account 
had been paid, and referred me to the same letter from a collection attorney, as 
discussed above.45 Her contention is erroneous, for the letter actually refers to another 
delinquent medical account, discussed below (SOR ¶ 2.e.). While the account no longer 
appears on Applicant’s 2012 credit report, there is no evidence that the delinquent $100 
account has been resolved.

There is an account with DirecTV in the amount of $267 (SOR ¶ 2.f.), that was 
placed for collection with a collection agency.46 The account was initially disputed 
because Applicant did not owe the amount cited and claimed the account was unknown 
to her.47 As of August 8, 2011, an investigation by the credit reporting agency was in 
progress.48 She subsequently contended the account had been resolved when she 
advised the creditor that she had returned the cable equipment and received a receipt.49 
Although Applicant indicated she would furnish me that receipt, as of this date, she has 
not done so. While the account no longer appears on Applicant’s 2012 credit report, 
there is no evidence that the delinquent account has been resolved. 
 
There are two credit card accounts in the respective amounts of $494 and $513 
that were placed for collection and charged off (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.h.).50 The accounts 
were initially disputed because Applicant claimed that she had previously paid the 
accounts in full, but the creditor was unable to find the accounts in order to furnish her 
receipts.51 Applicant’s 2012 credit report lists one of the accounts as having been paid 
for less than full balance and paid charge off, and the other as simply charged off.52 
Applicant subsequently acknowledged the accounts had not been paid because the 
creditor was unable to find records of them and she did not have sufficient money to pay 
them.53 She later changed her claim and stated the accounts had been paid off. 
Although Applicant indicated she would furnish me receipts, as of this date, she has not 
done so. There is no evidence that the delinquent accounts have been resolved. 
 
There is a gasoline credit card in the amount of $669 (SOR ¶ 1.i.), that was 
placed for collection.54 Applicant initially acknowledged the account and explained that 
she simply did not have sufficient funds to pay the bill.55 She claimed to have an 
agreement with the creditor to make a full payment by February 14, 2011.56 Applicant 
later claimed that she did not make a payment because the creditor did not know to

which company the account had been transferred.57 She disputed the account. As of 
August 8, 2011, an investigation by the credit reporting agency was in progress.58 She 
subsequently contended the account had been paid.59 Although Applicant indicated she 
would furnish me a receipt, as of this date, she has not done so. While the account no 
longer appears on Applicant’s 2012 credit report, there is no evidence that the 
delinquent account has been resolved. 
 
There is a telephone account in the amount of $1,493 (SOR ¶ 1.j.), that was 
placed for collection and charged off.60 Applicant initially acknowledged the account and 
explained that she may have missed a payment and forgotten to pay the bill.61 She 
claimed she paid the bill in full in February 2009.62  Applicant later denied owing $1,493 
and disputed the account.63 As of August 8, 2011, an investigation by the credit 
reporting agency was in progress.64 A reinvestigation was still in process as of February 
16, 2012.65 Applicant subsequently acknowledged that she was working on a possible 
settlement and was prepared to pay up to $700 to resolve the account.66 She did not 
furnish any documentary evidence to support her claim that negotiations were taking 
place, and there is no evidence that the delinquent account is being resolved or has 
been resolved. 
 
There is an automobile loan account, with a high credit of $17,101 and an unpaid 
balance of $9,527 (SOR ¶ 1.k.), on a vehicle that was voluntarily repossessed.67 
Applicant initially acknowledged voluntarily returning the vehicle after she purchased 
another vehicle, and wanted to use the first vehicle as a trade-in. The creditor refused to 
release the vehicle’s title and Applicant arranged for the creditor to sell it.68 Applicant 
contended there was an unpaid $2,933 balance at the time, but that amount was 
actually the past due balance.69 Applicant claimed to have made arrangements to make

monthly payments starting March 2011, with a final pay-off after she received her 
income tax refund.70 She has not furnished any documentation to support any such 
arrangement or any such payments. The account was disputed because Applicant 
claimed she did not owe $9,527.71 As of August 5, 2011, an investigation by the credit 
reporting agency was in progress.72 The dispute was apparently denied for the debt was 
restored to her 2012 credit report as unpaid.73 Applicant subsequently explained that a 
dispute took place over the unpaid balance, a pay-off amount, a penalty for an early 
pay-off, and the auction sale price, and she will continue to dispute the account until it is 
resolved.74 She has not submitted any documentation to support her contention that she 
has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt or to substantiate the basis 
of the dispute. There is no evidence that the delinquent account has been resolved. 
 
There is a loan with a community college in the amount of $422 (SOR ¶ 2.l.), that 
was placed for collection with a collection attorney on behalf of the state.75 Applicant 
initially denied knowing anything about the account, but indicated she would look into it 
and resolve it if it was hers.76 She subsequently disputed the account and contended 
that it had been satisfied.77 However, the documentation she submitted refers to a 
December 2002 judgment obtained by the state, in the amount of $1,017.64, plus 
attorney fees of $164.56, with no reference to the particular college.78 The account 
listed in the January 2011 credit report refers to an account that was opened in April 
2005.79 There is no documentation to indicate that the paperwork regarding the 
judgment refers to the account listed in the SOR. Accordingly, I conclude that there is 
no evidence that the delinquent account has been resolved. 
 
There are only two SOR-related accounts that have apparently been resolved: a 
medical account and an account stemming from a payday loan. The medical account 
with an orthopedic surgery center for service provided in September 2009, totaling 
approximately $192 (SOR ¶ 2.e.), was placed for  collection with a collection attorney.80

The account was initially disputed because Applicant did not owe $192.81 As of August 
8, 2011, an investigation by the credit reporting agency was in progress.82 Applicant 
finally paid the account in full on October 27, 2011.83 The account has been resolved. 
 
The payday loan account (SOR ¶ 2.m), totaling $905, was placed for collection 
and charged off. Applicant has consistently denied having any knowledge of the 
account,84 but was aware that it was for a payday loan.85 This account was one of those 
disputed by Applicant’s credit repair company, and it no longer appears on her 2012 
credit report. The account has apparently been resolved. 
 
In August 2011, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a 
net monthly family income of $7,794.82; monthly expenses of $2,628, not including child 
support to her ex-husband of $696;86 and debt repayments of $1,093.87 She estimated 
she has a monthly remainder of $4,073.82 (or actually $3,377.82 once the child support 
is deducted) available for discretionary spending.88  
 
Applicant has never received any “formal” financial counseling or debt 
management guidance either as part of her bankruptcy or elsewhere.89 She did, 
however, receive some financial guidance from her pastor who is an accountant.90 
Although Applicant indicated she would obtain a letter from her pastor to confirm her 
financial counseling,91 as of this date, she has not done so.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”92 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”93   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”94 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.95  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”96 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”97 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern under the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 
30:       
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 31(a), “a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 31(d), where an Aindividual is currently on parole or 
probation,@ may raise security concerns. As noted above, Applicant was convicted of 
two counts each of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor, and was 
sentenced to a total of 24 months in jail, with 24 months suspended, and two years of 
supervised probation. The period of probation ends in July 2013, unless terminated 
earlier by the court. AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(d) have been established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG ¶ 32(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
                                                          
96

happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.@ Similarly, AG ¶ 32(d) may apply where “there is evidence of successful 
rehabilitation: including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of 
criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good 
employment record, or constructive community involvement.”  
 
AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) only partially apply. Applicant was convicted in July 2011 
for actions that contributed to the delinquency of her two minor children. She lost 
physical custody of her daughters and remains on supervised probation until July 2013, 
unless terminated earlier by the court. It appears that Applicant has already complied 
with some of the court-imposed sentence, and is currently complying with her probation 
requirements. She has avoided any participation in additional criminal enterprises, but 
has offered minimal evidence of successful rehabilitation, a good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement. It has been less than one year since her 
conviction, a period too brief a period to conclude that such conduct will not recur.  
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until about 2002, when her debts were discharged under a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. Following the discharge of her debts, Applicant was debt-free, but within a 
few short years, her financial situation began to deteriorate once again. Accounts 
became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off, a vehicle was 
voluntarily repossessed, and tax liens were filed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
 
14 
                                      
 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@98 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. Applicant’s initial financial problems commenced 
sometime in 2002.  However, in that year, her debts were discharged in bankruptcy. 
She became debt-free, but within a few short years, her financial situation again began 
to deteriorate, with accounts becoming delinquent. She joined her current employer in 
January 2011, with a substantial salary. Applicant’s financial difficulties, regardless of 
causation, commenced in 2002, and with the exception of a brief debt-free period, have 
continued to the present. While she has attributed those difficulties in general terms to 
insufficient funds, she never fully described why she could not maintain her monthly 
payments. In the absence of more specific explanations, and considering her minimal 
attention to most of her accounts, her financial problems are likely to recur. The 
combination of factors casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.99  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies because there were several conditions beyond 
Applicant’s control that may have had a negative impact on Applicant’s financial 
situation. She went through a separation and divorce from her first husband, a 
temporary separation from her second husband, the loss of custody of her children, and 
the trauma of an arrest and conviction. It is unclear why Applicant’s first husband’s 
debts became her debts, as she never explained the situation. The basic question is 
whether or not Applicant eventually acted responsibly to address the debts that 
resulted. Based on the evidence supported by documentation, the answer is no. 
 
                                                          
98
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

15 
                                      
 
AG & 20(c) minimally applies because Applicant supposedly received informal 
financial counseling from her pastor, but failed to submit any documentation to support 
her claim. There is evidence that Applicant sought assistance in making strategic 
disputes regarding all of her delinquent accounts, but there is no clear evidence that 
Applicant’s financial problems are being resolved and are under control. Moreover, 
although she has presented a personal financial statement, there is little evidence that 
she is following any repayment plans in reducing her delinquencies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies. Nearly four months before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant engaged the professional services of a credit repair company to assist her in 
resolving 14 of her delinquent accounts. The purpose of the effort was not to simply 
resolve legitimate accounts, but rather to make strategic disputes against all the 
accounts purportedly because they were either outstanding or outdated on her credit 
report. Several non-SOR accounts were apparently resolved as a result of the dispute 
process, but Applicant has not submitted any documentation to reflect payments to the 
creditors listed in the SOR other than to the one medical provider. Applicant’s monthly 
remainder available for discretionary spending is substantial. Yet, rather than initiating a 
good-faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts, she has 
relied on the dispute process and made numerous inconsistent statements regarding 
each of the accounts and their current status. She indicated some accounts had been 
paid, but failed to furnish supporting documentation; then acknowledged they had not 
been paid; then claimed that because they were no longer on a current credit report, 
they had been paid. Over the years, Applicant had resolved some non-SOR accounts, 
but with the exception of the one medical account discussed above, she has not  
attempted to do so regarding the SOR accounts.100 Applicant has served as an 
administrative assistant, a human resources assistant, an executive assistant, and a 
financial analyst. Armed with financial knowledge from those positions, she should have 
exercised better judgment in addressing her debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  As noted above, Applicant, through her credit repair 
company, strategically disputed her debts but failed to furnish documentation to 
substantiate the basis for each dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue. Some accounts were disputed and deleted from her credit report. Other debts 
were disputed but remained.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
                                                          
100
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside 
his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
16 
                                      
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has a 
history of financial delinquencies commencing in 2002. She went through a separation 
and divorce from her first husband, a temporary separation from her second husband, 
the loss of custody of her children, and the trauma of an arrest and conviction. In 2011, 
she engaged the professional services of a credit repair company to assist her in 
resolving her delinquent accounts. Some of her non-SOR accounts were resolved. In 
addition, following her conviction, she complied with some of the court-imposed 
sentence, and is currently complying with her probation requirements. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant was convicted of two counts each of contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to a total of 24 months in jail, with 24 
months suspended, and two years of supervised probation. The period of probation 
ends in July 2013, unless terminated earlier by the court. Applicant’s debts were 
discharged in bankruptcy in 2002. She became debt-free, but within a few short years, 
her financial situation again began to deteriorate, with accounts becoming delinquent. 
She sought assistance in making strategic disputes regarding all of her delinquent 
accounts, but failed to establish a meaningful effort to resolve her SOR debts. I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.101 There is a continuing period of 
supervised probation, as well as a relative lack of good-faith efforts to actually resolve 
her delinquent debts. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:102 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
                                                          
101
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her criminal 
conduct and financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline J:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
   
Paragraph 2, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.h:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.i:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.j:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.k:    Against Applicant

18 
                                      
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
