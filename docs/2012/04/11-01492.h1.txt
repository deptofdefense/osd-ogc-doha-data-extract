GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 14, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on April 15, 2011.2 On July 14, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 27, 2011.3 On an unspecified 
date, Applicant submitted an undated statement and an attached Joint Parenting 
Agreement.4 In a sworn statement, dated November 8, 2011,5 Applicant responded to 
the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on January 12, 2012, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on January 24, 
2012, and as of April 12, 2012, he had not submitted any information. The case was 
assigned to me on April 17, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 11 of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.k.). Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since 
September 2008, has been serving as a principal engineer.6 He has never served with 
the U.S. military.7 Applicant has held a secret security clearance since June 2002. 8 He 
attended high school from August 1982 until May 1985, but did not graduate or receive 
a diploma.9 No information was provided regarding Applicant’s early employment 
history. He was an engineer from December 1998 until December 2003; and a technical 
engineer from December 2003 until September 2008.10

Applicant was married in March 1989 and divorced in August 2010.11 He married 
his second wife in November 2010.12 He has two children from his first marriage, born in 
December 1989, and September 1997, respectively.13 His eldest child is emancipated, 
but his youngest child resides with Applicant’s ex-wife under a Joint Parenting 
Agreement.14 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial problems. In November 
2010, he acknowledged having such problems “for several years,” and attributed those 
problems to his first wife’s extravagant spending habits.15 According to Applicant, she 
felt that the children should have whatever they wanted, and she spent money 
needlessly. A consequence of her actions was that Applicant would borrow money from 
his 401(k) retirement plan to help pay the bills.16 He would repay the loan only to go 
through the entire cycle repeatedly. In addition, although his first wife had a bachelor’s 
degree in teaching, she refused to work.17 Eventually, Applicant started missing monthly 
payments and accounts became delinquent.  
 
In 2001, after over-extending themselves because of a family vacation, Applicant 
decided to pay a variety of bills, but not one for his family’s third automobile.18 After 
missing three payments, the vehicle was repossessed.19 In 2004, after missing 
payments for another automobile for three months, that vehicle was also repossessed.20 
In early 2010, after missing payments, a piano was repossessed.21 In December 2009, 
Applicant stopped making mortgage payments for the family residence, and in March 
2011, the foreclosure process commenced.22 As a result of being chronically financially

overextended, accounts started to become delinquent, and were placed for collection or 
charged off.23 Because of the “vicious cycle” pertaining to his wife’s spending habits and 
their irreconcilable differences, Applicant and his wife decided to divorce.24 
 
In November 2011, Applicant’s annual gross salary was $89,900, with a monthly 
net salary of about $5,200.25 He estimated his take home pay for every two weeks to be 
about $2,600. He claimed $3,418 in monthly expenses, including $1,020 for child 
support, and $500 for ex-spousal maintenance.26 Using his numbers, he should have 
had approximately $1,782 left over each month for discretionary spending or savings. 
As of November 2010, Applicant was current on all of his newer accounts.27 
 
The SOR identified 11 continuing delinquencies, totaling approximately $70,709. 
One of those accounts is a delinquency of $17,717 on a home mortgage that is in a 
foreclosure status with a total loan balance of approximately $69,991. Two medical 
accounts have delinquent balances of $53 and $100, respectively. There is no dispute 
regarding any of the accounts, as Applicant has made no payments to any of the 
creditors.28 During his 2010 interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant indicated he would contact his creditors to set 
up repayment arrangements to satisfy his debts.29 He has not submitted any 
documentary evidence to confirm that he did so. He recently noted:30 
 
I am prepared to start the process to recover the listed debts. . . . Over the 
next two years I plan to recover all of the debts under $5000.00 dollars 
and will work with the other institutions to make agreed restitution and 
payments until all debts are recovered. 
 
Furthermore, because he has repeatedly promised to address his delinquent 
accounts in the future, and has not yet done so, there are no indications that his 
financial problems are being resolved or are under control. There is no evidence that 
Applicant has received any financial counseling regarding money management, debt 
consolidation, or repayment plans.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”31 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”32   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.34  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”35 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”36 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems go as far back as 2001, when a 
vehicle was repossessed. In 2004, another automobile was repossessed. In 2010, a 
piano was repossessed. In March 2011, the foreclosure process on his residence 
commenced. His financial difficulties remain unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.

7 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@37  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative 
recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since about 2001 make it difficult 
to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” There is no evidence 
to indicate Applicant has ever received counseling in money management, debt 
management, debt repayment, or budgeting. His declaration of future intention to 
resolve his debts, after so much time where no positive efforts were taken, not even the 
payment of a small $53 debt, does not qualify as a “good-faith” effort, and are entitled to 
little weight.38 In light of his substantial period of continuing financial problems, it is 
unlikely that they will be resolved in the short term, and they are likely to continue.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his 
first wife’s extravagant spending habits. In a way, Applicant continued to enable her 
spending sprees when he repeatedly borrowed money from his 401(k) retirement plan 
to help pay the bills. He also participated in decisions regarding overspending during a 
vacation.  His history of delinquent debt extends over many years and although his ex-
wife’s spending adversely affected his finances, he did not act responsibly under the 
circumstances. At some point he should have set up separate accounts and managed 
his own finances. 
 
                                                          
37
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

The evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. Accordingly, Applicant failed to mitigate his financial situation, 
and under the circumstances, his actions do cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.39   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.40       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His financial 
difficulties were caused, in part, because of his first wife’s extravagant spending habits. 
His newer accounts were current, as of 2010.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant encountered numerous delinquencies since 2001, and some of them resulted 
in repossessions and a residence in a foreclosure status. His track record for 
addressing his delinquent debts is unsatisfactory. Applicant could have made some 
reasonable timely efforts to resolve some of his SOR accounts, but he has not done so. 
Applicant’s actions indicate poor self-control and a lack of judgment, which raise 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
         
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
