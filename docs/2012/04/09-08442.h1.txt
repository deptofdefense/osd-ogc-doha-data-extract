Decision

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct and Financial Considerations 
concerns. He was recently involved in a motor vehicle accident while under the 
influence of alcohol and narcotic medication. He left the scene and, after being stopped 
by police, cocaine was discovered in his car. He was also recently involved in a 
domestic incident, where he violently assaulted his wife. He only recently completed 
probation for the domestic violence offense. He failed to establish that his past criminal 
behavior is no longer a concern. Applicant accumulated over $29,000 in bad debt that 
he has continuously promised to resolve, but failed to start paying until recently. He 
failed to establish that his financial situation is under control. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 15, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), setting out security concerns under Guideline 
 
2 
 
 
J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations).1 On September 15, 
2011, DOHA received Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.2 
 
 On November 1, 2011, Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
ready to proceed with a hearing in the case. After coordinating with the parties, I 
scheduled the hearing via video teleconference for December 5, 2011.3  
 
 At hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, 
which were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel also 
submitted a chart of the debts at issue as a demonstrative aide. Applicant appeared at 
hearing with counsel, testified, and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through J. These 
exhibits were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant’s request to keep the 
record open to provide him additional time to submit matters for my consideration. He 
timely submitted six additional documents relating to his past-due debts and completion 
of probation. These documents were marked as AE K through P, and admitted without 
objection. Applicant also submitted his performance reviews from 2009 to 2011, which 
were collectively marked and admitted as AE Q. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
December 14, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 56 years old. He is a welder by training and was originally hired by 
his current employer in 1980. He was laid off in 1995, but was rehired by his employer 
in 2002. He was then promoted to his current position of foreman. He was first granted 
a security clearance in 1980. He is a good worker, and is described by his union 
representative as an “honest, responsible, and trustworthy person.”4 
 
 Applicant is legally separated from his wife, who he married in 1975. They have 
three adult children. His middle child is handicapped. He financially supports his family.5 
 
 Applicant’s legal and financial problems started in about 2006 when he was 
diagnosed with Hepatitis C. He got depressed, and started abusing alcohol and his 
                                                          
1
 DOHA took this action acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on 
September 1, 2006.

prescription medication. Applicant moved out of his house and began dating his current 
girlfriend, who also used to drink heavily and has mental health issues. Applicant’s 
drinking, coupled with his abuse of narcotic medication, contributed to his commission 
of several criminal offenses, including a violent attack on his wife for which he recently 
completed probation. Applicant also disregarded his financial obligations and amassed 
over $29,000 in bad debt, which he only recently started to tackle.  
 
Criminal History 
 
In December 2006, Applicant was living with his current girlfriend and they had 
an alcohol-induced argument. Applicant asked her to leave and, when she did not, he 
physically removed her from the house. The police were called and Applicant’s girlfriend 
claimed that Applicant had assaulted her. Applicant and his girlfriend were arrested. 
Applicant’s girlfriend later recanted her claim and a restraining order was issued against 
her. Applicant was told the charge against him for domestic violence would be dropped 
if he remained on good behavior for three months. The charge was eventually dropped 
and Applicant petitioned the court to have the restraining order against his girlfriend 
lifted. After this incident, Applicant reconciled with his wife and moved back into their 
home.6 (SOR ¶ 1.b) 
 
 In December 2008, Applicant was out of work due to a work-related injury. He 
was taking percocet and vicodin while drinking alcohol.7 After stopping to pick up beer 
at a store, Applicant hit another car. He left the scene and was later stopped by police. 
He lied to the police when he claimed he had not used percocet prior to the accident. 
The police searched his car, and uncovered a weapon and “two rocks of cocaine.”8 
Applicant was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, illegal weapons 
possession, and illegal drug possession. He denies the cocaine found in his car was 
his. He had not driven the car in about two months and his son had been using it. At 
hearing, Applicant testified that he did not confront his son about the illegal drugs found 
in his car, because he did not believe the drugs belonged to his son. Applicant decided 
not to contest the charges in court to avoid the possibility of conviction. He entered an 
accelerated rehabilitation program and was placed on probation. Applicant maintains 
that the other car suffered no damage and the other driver is exaggerating his injuries. I 
find that Applicant committed the charged criminal offenses.9 (SOR ¶ 1.a) 
 
 Applicant submitted his current security clearance application (SCA) in April 
2009. He disclosed the above criminal matters and then discussed them with a 
government investigator in August 2009. He also discussed his history of alcohol use.

He started drinking in his teens and drank responsibly until his 40’s, when he started 
binge drinking. He claimed to have not used alcohol since December 2008.10  
 
In December 2009, Applicant was again arrested for domestic violence. He had 
been drinking alcohol and had taken percocet earlier in the day. He got into an 
argument with his wife and physically assaulted her. Applicant’s wife had to be 
hospitalized for her injuries. Applicant was arrested and charged with strangulation and 
disorderly conduct. He was placed on probation and a restraining order was issued 
against him. He completed the terms of his probation in June 2011. The restraining 
order is still in effect.11 (SOR ¶ 1.c) 
 
 Applicant’s domestic violence arrest in December 2009 resulted in court-
mandated anger management and alcohol and drug treatment. He completed the court-
mandated anger management program in October 2010. On his own initiative, he 
sought out and has been in treatment with a private psychologist to resolve his long 
term anger issues. He testified that the last time he drank alcohol was in December 
2009. He has been consistently going to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) since the 
December 2009 incident, but had not gone in the two weeks leading up to the hearing 
because he was a “nervous wreck.”12  
 
Applicant has been legally separated from his wife since the December 2009 
domestic violence incident. His relationship with his wife and his family has improved 
over the past year. His girlfriend lives with him on occasion. Applicant and his girlfriend 
no longer drink alcohol, and he does not allow any alcohol in his home. They both 
realize that their use of alcohol was a problem and attend AA meetings together. 
Applicant refuses to take any narcotic medication and will only take over-the-counter 
aspirin for his work-related medical issues.13 
 
Financial History 
 
 After being diagnosed with Hepatitis C, Applicant started spending his money on 
alcohol and, to a lesser extent, on gambling. He stopped paying his bills.14 He disclosed 
his delinquent debts on his April 2009 SCA, including a delinquent credit card debt 
totaling $7,686. He claimed in his SCA to be paying this credit card debt. In August 
2009, Applicant told a government investigator that he had been paying $50 a month 
towards the debt for a year.15 In November 2010, DOHA asked Applicant about this

delinquent credit card debt. He promised to start paying $200 per month towards the 
debt starting in February 2011.16 He made a single payment of $50 towards this debt on 
the day of the hearing.17 He did not submit proof of any other payments towards this 
debt. (SOR 2.a) 
 
Applicant also disclosed on his April 2009 SCA that he had a car repossessed. 
The creditor secured a judgment for over $21,000 in February 2011. Applicant was 
required to start paying $35 per week starting in March 2011. He did not make the 
required payments and claims that he did not receive the court paperwork. In his 
interrogatory response to DOHA from November 2010, Applicant stated that he would 
satisfy this judgment once he received an anticipated money award for injuries he had 
sustained on the job. After the hearing, Applicant agreed to start paying $100 every two 
weeks to satisfy the judgment and submitted proof of one payment.18 (SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 
2.e) 
 
Although he made no payments towards the delinquent credit card debt and 
judgment until recently, Applicant did purchase a high-end motorcycle in March 2011. 
He returned the motorcycle to the lender after several months, because he could no 
longer afford the monthly payments. The motorcycle was sold by the lender for more 
than Applicant owed and he is no longer liable on this account.19 (SOR ¶ 2.f) 
 
Applicant did satisfy a $270 debt shortly before the hearing.20 (SOR ¶ 2.f) He has 
not satisfied the two minor debts for $881 and $98, which he previously promised to 
pay.21 (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c) Applicant also owes back taxes from 2007. He has been 
paying per an agreement with the IRS.22 His most recent credit report notes additional 
delinquent debts that he claims to have paid.23

manage the family’s finances and he is now figuring out how to manage his money. He 
has not taken a financial counseling course.24 
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.  
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.  
 
The Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. On the other hand, an applicant is responsible for 
presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts 
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.25 An 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
In resolving this ultimate question, an administrative judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt 
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information . . . in favor 
of national security.” AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. “A 
clearance adjudication is an applicant’s opportunity to demonstrate that, prior to being 
awarded a clearance, he (or she) actually possesses the judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness essential to a fiduciary relationship with this country.”26

 ISCR Case No. 11-00391 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 2011) (“Once an applicant’s SOR admissions 
and/or the Government’s evidence raise a security concern, the burden of persuasion shifts to the 
applicant to mitigate the concern.”).

 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, 
consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
 The criminal conduct concern is addressed at AG ¶ 30, as follows: 
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
 Applicant’s December 2008 arrest for leaving the scene of an accident and 
December 2009 domestic violence incident implicates the above concern.27 These 
offenses also establish the following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 31: 
 
(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  
 
(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.28 
 
 An applicant may mitigate the criminal conduct concern by establishing one or 
more of the mitigating conditions listed under AG ¶ 32. I have considered all the 
mitigating conditions and only the following were potentially raised by the evidence: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and 
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited 
to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or 
                                                          
27
 See ISCR Case No. 11-03025 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2012) (Appeal Board upholds judge’s finding 
that applicant committed domestic violence incident despite the lack of a conviction). 
 
28
 I do not find that Applicant’s December 2006 arrest for domestic violence implicates the 
Guideline J concern or any of the disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 31, because the evidence supports 
a finding that Applicant did not commit the charged offense. However, Applicant’s judgment to remain in a 
relationship with the individual who falsely accused him of a violent crime, had a restraining order issued 
against her after the 2006 incident, and has her own issues with alcohol, undercuts Applicant’s favorable 
evidence. See generally ISCR Case No. 10-00922 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2011). 
 
 
8 
 
 
restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement. 
 
 Applicant’s criminal conduct was tied to his substance abuse and anger-
management issues. He has sought treatment for these underlying issues. He recently 
completed his probation for his violent assault on his wife. However, the assault did not 
occur under unusual circumstances and a restraining order remains in place as a result 
of this criminal conduct. Further, Applicant continues to deny culpability and does not 
truly appreciate the significant danger that he created when he decided to drive after 
abusing alcohol and his prescription medication. His actions resulted in an accident that 
he refuses to acknowledge caused serious injury to the other driver and damage to his 
vehicle. He also refuses to admit that the cocaine seized in his car was his. Under the 
circumstances, the passage of time and Applicant’s recent completion of probation do 
not mitigate the security concern raised by his criminal conduct. AG ¶ 32(a) and (d) do 
not apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the criminal conduct concern. 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to financial problems is articulated at AG ¶ 18, as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
One aspect of the concern is that an individual who is financially irresponsible 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Applicant’s accumulation of a significant amount of 
delinquent debt over a lengthy period of time, which was in part due to his alcohol 
abuse, directly implicates this concern. It also establishes the following disqualifying 
conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling 
problems, or other issues of security concern.  
 
 An applicant may mitigate the financial considerations concern by establishing 
one or more of the mitigating conditions listed under AG ¶ 20. The relevant mitigating 
conditions are:  
 
9 
 
 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant decided not to pay his bills after finding out about his medical condition. 
He started spending his money on alcohol and, to a lesser extent, on gambling. His 
feeling of despair at finding out about his medical condition is understandable, but his 
decision not to pay his financial obligations is not. He has promised to resolve his 
delinquent debts throughout the security clearance process and failed to follow through 
until recently. He still has not paid an old bill for less than $100 that he has been on 
notice of since at least November 2010. He currently has over $29,000 in bad debt. The 
majority of this debt is for a $21,000 judgment that was secured by his creditor in 
February 2011. He did not pay the $35 monthly payment required by the terms of the 
judgment and, instead, purchased a high-end motorcycle. Applicant did pay other debts 
and financially supports his family. However, Applicant’s effort to put his financial house 
in order is far too recent to mitigate the security concerns raised by his finances. None 
of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant’s finances remain a security concern. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).29 I gave due consideration to Applicant’s possession of 
a security clearance for over 25 years without incident and the potential ramification this 
                                                          
29
 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; 
(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. 
 
 
10 
 
 
decision may have on his family.30 However, the protection of national security is the 
paramount concern in assessing an applicant’s security suitability. Further, security 
clearance adjudications are “not an exact science, but rather predictive judgments” 
where an applicant’s past history is the best indicator of future conduct.31 Applicant’s 
past history of criminal activity and financial irresponsibility leaves me with serious 
doubts that his recent positive changes are permanent. Accordingly, I find that the 
favorable whole-person factors present in this case do not outweigh the security 
concerns at issue. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts 
about Applicant’s continued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings regarding the SOR allegations: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):       AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:          For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c:        Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a – 2.e:         Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 2.f and 2.g:        For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence and for the foregoing reasons, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.
