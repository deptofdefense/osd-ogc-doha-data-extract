Decision 
______________ 
 
 
MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant owes about $17,373 in delinquent debt. Although he was on disability and 
more recently unemployed for short periods, he has been consistently employed since 
October 2009. He has made little progress toward resolving his past-due accounts. 
Clearance denied. 
 
 Statement of the Case  
 
On October 17, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)
1
 to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations, why it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him a security clearance. DOHA took action under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security

In response to interrogatories (Gov. X 6), Applicant corrected his name to note that he is a junior. The SOR 
does not include the suffix.  
 
 
 2 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on November 4, 2011, and he requested a 
decision without a hearing. On January 16, 2012, the Government submitted a File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of ten exhibits (Items 1-10).
2
 DOHA forwarded a copy 
of the FORM to Applicant on January 24, 2012, and instructed him to respond within 30 
days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on January 31, 2012. He elected not to 
respond by the February 29, 2012 due date, and on March 21, 2012, the case was 
assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleged under Guideline F that as of October 17, 2011, Applicant owed 
$23,488 in delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.y), including a $1,147 unpaid credit card judgment 
(SOR 1.j). Applicant admitted the debts without explanation. After considering the 
Government’s FORM, including Applicant’s Answer (GE 3), I make the following findings of 
fact. 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old composite fabricator, who has been employed by a 
defense contractor since October 2009. Applicant previously worked for the company from 
July 2007 to January 2008, but there is no indication that he held a DOD security clearance 
during that time. (GE 4.) 
 
Applicant pursued college studies from January 1997 to May 2001, although he did 
not earn a degree. Since September 2001, Applicant has been cohabiting on and off with 
his girlfriend, with whom he has had some relationship problems. As of December 2009, 
Applicant was spending most weekends with her and their three children. They have a 
daughter born in October 2002 and sons born in June 2005 and June 2008. (GE 4.) 
 
From January 2002 to February 2003, Applicant was a runner for a private 
company. For the next nine months, he worked in the warehouse for a furniture retailer. He 
then worked as an installer for a garage door company until May 2007. Following a brief 
period of unemployment, in July 2007 he entered the defense industry as a fabricator for 
his current employer, although he stayed only six months. Applicant worked as a “CNC 
operator” for a succession of private well-drilling companies between January 2008 and 
October 2009, excepting some additional unemployment from March 2009 to July 2009, 
and September 2009 to October 2009. He has been consistently employed by his defense 
contractor employer since October 2009. (GE 4.) 
 
On December 7, 2009, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He responded affirmatively to a couple of financial

The exhibits were pre-marked as Gov. X 1-10, respectively. The exhibits are referred to as GE 1-10 in this 
decision.

record inquiries covering the last seven years: 26.g, any bills or debts turned over to a 
collection agency, and 26.h, any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or 
cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. He answered “Yes” as well to question 26.n 
concerning any debts currently over 90 days delinquent. Applicant listed the debts in SOR 
1.a, 1.c, 1.e-1.h, 1.m-1.n, 1.q, and 1.u (duplicated in SOR 1.r). Although Applicant 
responded “No” to question 26.b, whether he had any possessions or property voluntarily 
or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed within the last seven years, he indicated that he 
had a car repossessed for failure to make his loan payments (SOR 1.u). Applicant 
attributed the vehicle repossession to the lender setting a monthly payment beyond what 
had been promised in a refinancing. Applicant explained that he fell behind on his other 
bills when he was out of work on disability for six months after he was assaulted in 2006. 
He indicated that now that he had a job, he would be able to make payment arrangements 
with his creditors. (GE 4.) 
 
A check of Applicant’s credit on December 22, 2009, revealed a previously 
undisclosed court judgment of $1,147 (SOR 1.j) filed in August 2008, and some medical 
debts in collection, including a $789 debt (SOR 1.x). (GE 5.) On January 20, 2010, 
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the DOD about the adverse 
credit accounts on his e-QIP and his credit report. Applicant explained that he utilized his 
credit cards to make payments on some credit card accounts and living expenses while he 
was out of work on disability. Applicant denied any knowledge of the outstanding judgment 
against him, although he admitted that he had an account with the credit lender at one time 
that went delinquent. He indicated that he incurred the debt in SOR 1.h, knowing that he 
did not have the funds in his account, and the debt in SOR 1.d consisted of overdraft 
charges. Applicant did not deny the medical or consumer credit card debts on his record. 
He asserted he was able to meet his current obligations, and he intended to use his 
income tax refund to make payments on his past-due debts. (GE 6.) 
 
In January 2010, Applicant paid off a $700 fine for a March 2009 domestic violence 
incident involving his girlfriend. (GE 6.) As of October 2010, he owed $900 in child support. 
While the debt had not been paid as of November 2011, there is no indication that he owed 
any additional arrearage. (GE 9.) 
  
At DOHA’s request, Applicant detailed efforts to address his debts as of April 14, 
2011. He provided documentation showing a balance of $68.27 due on the account in SOR 
1.c due to interest. He planned to pay the debt in $20 installments. He had also arranged 
to make monthly payments of $20 toward SOR 1.n and of $25 to another creditor.
3
 Initial 
payments were due by April 27, 2011. (GE 7.) 
 
Subsequent credit checks of July 13, 2011, and January 16, 2012, reflected no 
progress toward resolving his past-due accounts. (GEs 8, 9.) The delinquency history of 
the debts in the SOR is set forth in the following table.

Applicant provided information about contacts with a collection agency, but it is unclear which debt is currently 
held by that assignee.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
 
 7 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Guideline F notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. The 
Government alleged that as of October 2011, Applicant had 25 accounts that were past 
due in the aggregate $23,488. Applicant admitted all of the debts as alleged, although the 
evidence shows that some of the accounts were alleged in the SOR more than once. The 
loan for the repossessed car was apparently refinanced, and DOHA alleged the debt under 
the names of the original lender, the refinancing lender, and the current holder. Based on 
the latest available debt information, Applicant owed about $17,373 in delinquent debt as 
of the end of 2011. AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), 
“a history of not meeting financial obligations,” are established. 
 
  Concerning potentially mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so 
long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment,” cannot reasonably apply, given the absence of any demonstrated progress 
toward resolving his past-due debt balances. AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in 
 
 8 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,” applies to the extent that his 
financial problems can be attributed to medical issues or unemployment. About $1,375 of 
his delinquent debt is clearly medical or dental. Applicant submits that another $3,267 of 
his debt (SOR 1.h, 1.m) is medical. The debt was incurred on consumer credit accounts, 
which could have been used to pay medical expenses. Applicant was apparently out of 
work on disability for six months in 2006, and he was unemployed from May 2007 to June 
2007, March 2009 to July 2009, and September 2009 to October 2009. The evidence 
corroborates the negative impact of his disability in 2006. Several non-medical accounts 
went delinquent in 2006 (SOR 1.d, 1.f, 1.l-1.n, and 1.w). However, AG ¶ 20(b) does not 
mitigate Applicant’s failure to address the debts, including a court judgment, once he was 
gainfully employed. The apartment debt in SOR 1.b and the telephone debt are from the 
January to February 2009 timeframe, when Applicant had employment income. 
 
 Applicant is credited with making repayment arrangements with three of his creditors 
or their assignees around April 2011. Yet, with no evidence of any payments in the record 
before me, I cannot conclude that the financial concerns are fully mitigated under either AG 
¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts,” or AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.” AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
applies only in that some of the alleged debts (SOR 1.p, 1.r-1.t, 1.v, and 1.y) were shown 
to be duplicate listings and not additional balances. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
6
 
 
Applicant was candid from the outset about his financial difficulties, which were 
caused in part by factors outside of his control. While he has a responsibility to repay his 
creditors, he is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged 
in the SOR. Applicants for security clearance need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that 
                                                 
6 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 9 
an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 
at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant indicated on his e-QIP in December 2009 that he 
could begin repaying his debts, now that he was fully employed. He has provided no 
reasonable explanation for why he has not satisfied any of his past-due debts as of 
January 2012. His January 2012 credit report shows a $900 child support balance. A 
substantial child support obligation could explain a lack of progress in resolving his old 
debts, but even so, a couple of his medical debts are under $100, and the telephone debt 
is only $105. The evidence falls considerably short of showing that he has done all that he 
can to address his financial problems. Based on the record before me, I am unable to 
conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant security 
clearance eligibility.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
