TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s Statement of Reasons (SOR) lists 17 delinquent debts totaling 
$44,518. Applicant has not made sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts 
since he became employed by a Government contractor in September 2010. He 
intentionally failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his October 6, 2010 Electronic 
Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF-86) because he wanted to 
obtain employment. Financial considerations and personal conduct concerns are not 
mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.   
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 6, 2010, Applicant submitted an SF-86 (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). 
On September 15, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him. (Hearing Exhibit) HE 2) The action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which were promulgated by 
the President. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a 
determination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
DOHA set forth the basis for its action in the SOR, citing security concerns under 
Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct). (HE 2) 
 
On October 10, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On December 21, 
2011, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On February 8, 2012, the case 
was assigned to me. On February 14, 2012, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the 
hearing for February 29, 2012. (HE 2) The hearing was held as scheduled. Applicant 
waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of his hearing. (Tr. 6-
7) At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 19-20; GE 
1-4) Applicant offered seven exhibits. (Tr. 20-21; AE A-G) I admitted GE 1-4 and AE A-
G. (Tr. 19-21) Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR, and the hearing 
notice. (HE 1-3) On March 15, 2012, I received the hearing transcript. I held the record 
open until March 16, 2012. (Tr. 95-96) I received three exhibits after the hearing, which 
were admitted without objection. (AE H-J) 
 
Findings of Fact1
 
 
Applicant admitted responsibility with explanations for the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, 1.n, and 1.o. (HE 3) He denied the remainder of the SOR 
allegations with some explanations. (Id) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 58-year-old marine diesel mechanic, who has been employed by a 
defense contractor since September 2010. (Tr. 21; GE 1) He worked for a large 
corporation from 1985 to 2007 until he was offered and accepted a “buy-out package” 
wherein he receives a monthly $1,995 pension from that corporation. (Tr. 30-31, 34, 88) 
In 1989, he earned a general equivalency diploma (GED). (Tr. 21-22) He has attended 
three trade schools. (Tr. 22-23) Applicant married in 1985, and his spouse passed away 
in July 2003. (Tr. 24) He has been living with a woman since 2004 or 2005. (Tr. 25) He 
has one stepchild from his first marriage. (Tr. 26) He has never served in the military. 
(GE 1) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling $44,518 as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a is a 
judgment, alleging a delinquent debt for $2,696; SOR ¶ 1.b is a federal tax lien, alleging 
a delinquent debt for $19,996; SOR  ¶ 1.c is a medical collection debt for $175; SOR ¶ 
1.d is a utility debt for $260; SOR ¶ 1.e is a medical collection debt for $34; SOR ¶ 1.f is 
a telecommunications debt for  $346; SOR ¶ 1.g is a telecommunications debt for $787; 
SOR ¶ 1.h is a telecommunications debt for $43; SOR ¶ 1.i is a medical collection debt 
for $95; SOR ¶ 1.j is a telecommunications debt for $378; SOR ¶ 1.k is a charged-off 
                                            
1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations 
in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.

account owed for a vehicle for $6,035; SOR ¶ 1.l is a charged-off account owed to a 
financial company for $12,349; SOR ¶ 1.m is a telecommunications collection debt for 
$230; SOR ¶ 1.n is a collection account for $99; SOR ¶ 1.o is a medical collection debt 
for $34; SOR ¶ 1.p is a telecommunications collection account for $219; and SOR ¶ 1.q 
is a collection account for $742. (HE 2)  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant’s debt consolidation plan went into effect or was 
established. (AE A) On January 2, 2012, Applicant was in “prerepresentation” status 
with the debt consolidation company. (AE A at 7) On January 23, 2012, Applicant 
signed a release of information form on his debt consolidation plan. (AE A at 1) 
Applicant planned to pay $410 monthly into a debt consolidation plan. (Tr. 56; AE A at 
7) His first payment was scheduled for January 14, 2012. (AE A at 7) He listed five 
creditors in this plan, and four of the creditors are listed in the SOR ¶¶: 1.c ($175); 1.d 
($260); 1.k ($17,856); and 1.l ($12,349). (AE A at 7) On February 29, 2012, the debt 
consolidation company wrote that the new monthly payment is $453, which will address 
11 debts totaling $33,950, and the first payment will be due on March 14, 2012. (AE J at 
1, 2)  
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $2,696 resulted from a dispute Applicant had with his 
landlord over repairs and the habitability of a house Applicant rented. (Tr. 37-38) 
Applicant made necessary repairs. (Tr. 39) After Applicant left the rental house in June 
2009, the landlord filed a lawsuit for damage to the property, and Applicant went to 
court. (Tr. 40-44) Applicant thought the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a was included in his debt 
consolidation plan; however, it was not actually included. (Tr. 45-46; AE A, J) There is 
no evidence he made any payments to address this debt. 
 
 Applicant included the tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.b for $19,996 in his debt consolidation 
plan. (Tr. 45) However, it is not one of the five debts listed for payment in his first plan, 
and it is not one of the 11 debts listed in his second plan. (AE A, J) On January 24, 
2012, Applicant’s tax counselor wrote that the tax debt may be dramatically reduced or 
eliminated because it may have been miscalculated by the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). (Tr. 48; AE B) Applicant paid $5,000 to the IRS, when a $3,500 tax refund and a 
$1,500 refund were intercepted by the IRS. (Tr. 49-50) His counselor hoped to have a 
payment plan with the IRS where Applicant would pay $200 per month. (Tr. 50) 
Applicant has not made any voluntary payments to address his IRS debt. (Tr. 51) 
Applicant said he has paid his counselor $200 towards a $1,400 bill for assistance on 
his debts. (Tr. 52) As of February 27, 2012, Applicant tax debt stands at $13,495 for his 
2008 1040A. (AE I at 1) 
 
 The medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is now $175. (Tr. 53-54; GE 4; SOR response) 
Applicant declined to accept responsibility for the utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.d for $260. (Tr. 
54-55; SOR response) He included both of these debts in his debt consolidation plan. 
(Tr. 53-55; AE A at 7) Applicant said he paid the $34 debt described in SOR ¶ 1.e using 
a debit card. (Tr. 56-57) Applicant thought the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o for $34 is the same as 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $34. (Tr. 78-79) Applicant admitted responsibility for the 
medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.n for $99. (Tr. 77-78) Although it is not part of his debt 
consolidation plan, he plans to have it added later. (Tr. 78)

Applicant denied knowledge of and responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m for 
$230, 1.p for $219, and 1.q for $742. (Tr. 57-58, 77, 79) For the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f for 
$346 and 1.g for $787, Applicant said he had a telecommunications account; however, 
he remained unsure of his responsibility for this debt. (Tr. 58-60) If these debts are 
established, he plans to add them to his debt consolidation plan. (Tr. 59-60)  
 
Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h for $43 to install a telecommunications 
device was paid using a credit card or debit card. (Tr. 60-61) He accepted responsibility 
for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i for $95; however, he did not include it in his debt consolidation 
plan because he did not provide the SOR to the debt consolidation company. (Tr. 61-62, 
73)  
 
 On February 29, 2012, one creditor (M) agreed to settle a debt with a balance of 
$18,096 for $8,143 to be paid by making 30 monthly payments of $278. (Tr. 75-76; AE 
J; SOR ¶ 1.k) This debt resulted when Applicant cosigned for his live-in girlfriend’s 
vehicle, and it was repossessed. (Tr. 73-74) Applicant voluntarily returned the vehicle to 
the creditor. (Tr. 73) Applicant said he did not learn about the resulting debt until he 
reviewed his credit report. (Tr. 75)  
 
 Applicant thought the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k for $6,035 and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l for 
$12,349 might both be combined in the collection action by creditor M. (Tr. 76) 
However, he conceded that the two debts resulted from the repossession of two 
vehicles and were listed with two different collection companies on his credit report. (Tr. 
76-77) There is insufficient evidence to conclude the two debts are combined in the 
collection debt by creditor M.  
 
Applicant receives $370 per month from a survivor insurance policy. (Tr. 34) His 
monthly salary from the Government contractor is $2,800, and his gross salary is about 
$4,250. (Tr. 34)  
 
Circumstances Beyond Applicant’s Control 
 
Over that last nine years, five events beyond Applicant’s control adversely 
affected his finances. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by his spouse’s 
illness and death in July 2003, his head injury and resulting medical bills in 2007, his 
two years of unemployment ending in September 2010, the bad tax advice he received 
about receipt of funds from his 401K account being tax free, and his dental bills. 
  
Applicant said he had a large debt of about $92,000 that he paid off over four 
years, which resulted from credit cards and his spouse’s illness and death in July 2003. 
(Tr. 33, 80-84) His finances were damaged due to the loss of his spouse’s income. (Tr. 
34) She was making about $200,000 per year, and Applicant was making about 
$35,000 per year. (Tr. 84) He did not provide evidence of any payments to address his 
spouse’s debts after he became employed by a defense contractor in September 2010.

In 2006 or 2007, Applicant had a head injury, which required surgery. (Tr. 26-27) 
He was out of work for about six months because of residual dizziness from the head 
injury. (Tr. 27) In 2008, Applicant took out a $40,000 loan against his 401K retirement 
account. (Tr. 28-30) Applicant was incorrectly advised that there would not be any 
federal income tax penalty for the early withdrawal of funds from his 401K account. (Tr. 
29) There was not a penalty; however, Applicant was unaware that the funds 
themselves were taxable. (Tr. 29) Part of the $40,000 was withheld for taxes when 
Applicant received the funds. (Tr. 29-30) 
 
Applicant indicated he was actually unemployed for “over two years,” and this 
included six months before he attended the trade school. (Tr. 32-33) He attended a 
marine-related trade school from February 2009 to August 2010 while he was 
unemployed, and he received a certificate of completion from the trade school. (Tr. 24, 
32-33; GE 1) Applicant lived on student loans, the remainder of his 401K funds, and his 
corporate pension while he was attending the trade school. (Tr. 32) He now owes about 
$26,000 in student loans, and he said he made two $150 payments in August and 
September 2010. (Tr. 84-87) He said he put his student loan payments on hold. (Tr. 84-
87) He said the student loans were deferred; however, he could not explain the basis or 
terms of the deferral. (Tr. 86-87) He said he could provide the deferral documentation 
after his hearing; however, he did not do so. (Tr. 87)  
 
Applicant generated substantial debts from his dental bills. (Tr. 35) Most of his 
teeth were replaced with implants. (Tr. 35) He did not have dental insurance. (Tr. 35-36) 
He did not provide documentation showing the status of the debts resulting from his 
dental bills.   
 
Personal Conduct 
 
Applicant’s October 6, 2010 SF-86 asked five relevant questions concerning his 
finances as follows: (1) section 26d asked, “Have you had a lien placed against your 
property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?”; (2) section 26f asked, “Have you 
defaulted on any type of loan?”; (3) section 26m asked, “Have you been over 180 days 
delinquent on any debt(s)?”; (4) section 26n asked, “Are you currently over 90 days 
delinquent on any debt(s)?”; and (5) section 26p asked, “Are you currently delinquent on 
any Federal debt?”. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a to 2.e)2
 
 
Applicant defaulted on two vehicle loans, and both vehicles were voluntarily 
repossessed (Applicant was a cosigner for one vehicle). (Tr. 65-66) Applicant said he 
thought it was not a default because he voluntarily returned the vehicles, and he was 
unfamiliar with repossessions. (Tr. 66) He did not believe the tax lien was a true lien 
because it was not attached to his bank accounts. (Tr. 67) He made two payments to 
IRS when the IRS intercepted his tax refunds.  
                                            
2For sections 26c-26m, Applicant’s SF-86 sought financial information in the last seven years. 
(GE 1) The SOR did not cite Applicant for answering “No” to section 26e which asked, “Have you had a 
judgment entered against you?” (GE 1) I draw no adverse inference against Applicant for his answer to 
section 26e. 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
In regard to his failure to provide information about delinquent debts, Applicant 
explained, “I tell you[,] I swear I needed a job so bad. I just—I didn’t think I was 
defaulting or I didn’t think I was saying anything direct. I was trying to find a job and I 
was t[r]ying to get a job.” Department Counsel asked Applicant, “Were you concerned 
that if you represented that you had debt you might not get the job?” He responded, 
“Yes, sir, I was. I was concerned about one thing, that I needed a job.” (Tr. 68) He 
added that he disclosed his financial problems to the investigator from the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM). (Tr. 68)   
 
Character Evidence 
 
The contract compliance director for the contractor employing Applicant 
described him as an excellent employee, who performed well beyond expectations.3
 
 He 
was the site manager who observed Applicant’s work performance from September 22, 
2010 to June 11, 2011. He lauded Applicant for being a diligent, responsible, and 
trustworthy employee. He recommended approval of Applicant’s security clearance 
without reservation.  
Applicant was selected as Employee of the Year for 2011 because of his 
“sustained exceptional performance.” (AE D) He exemplified the attributes of being 
diligent, methodical, positive, dedication, goal oriented, and focused on safety. (AE D-F) 
He was previously the Employee of the Quarter for first and third quarters of 2011. (AE 
E, F) He completed training courses in basic fire fighting, first aid, personal survival, and 
social responsibility on September 22, 2010. (AE G) 
  
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
                                            
3 The information in this paragraph is from a letter of recommendation written by Applicant’s 
contract compliance director on November 29, 2011. (AE C) 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Adverse clearance decisions are made “in terms of the national interest and 
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.” See 
Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct). 
  
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
SF-86, credit reports, his OPM interview, his SOR response, and his hearing. 
Applicant’s SOR lists 17 delinquent debts totaling $44,518. The Government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants limited application of AG ¶¶ 
20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).4
 
 Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by his spouse’s 
illness and death in July 2003, his head injury and resulting medical bills in 2007, his 
two years of unemployment ending in September 2010, his bad tax advice about receipt 
of funds from his 401K account, and his dental bills. However, Applicant did not act 
responsibly under the circumstances. He did not establish sufficient progress resolving 
his delinquent debts after he obtained employment in September 2010. He is credited 
with paying the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($34) and 1.h ($43). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($34) is 
mitigated because it is a duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($34). He reduced his 
federal tax debt from $19,996 to $13,495 when the IRS intercepted his tax refunds. 
Applicant is credited with some financial counseling through his generation of a 
budget and receipt of advice from his debt consolidation company. He showed some 
good faith when he admitted responsibility for some of his SOR debts in his SOR 
response and at his hearing. He has not provided sufficient information about efforts to 
start paying his SOR creditors before 2011 to fully establish any mitigating conditions.  
 
Although Applicant said he did not accept responsibility for several debts, he did 
not provide documentary evidence that he disputed any debts or any entries on his 
credit report, and AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. He maintained contact with some of his 
SOR creditors, and he attempted to negotiate some payment plans;5
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 nevertheless, 
there are no receipts or account statements from creditors, establishing any payments 
to the SOR creditors. Even if he had made one or two payments to the debt 
consolidation company, to creditor M, and to the IRS, this would not be enough to 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

establish a sufficient track record of debt payments in this case. There is insufficient 
evidence that his financial problem is being resolved and is under control. The file lacks 
evidence that he has acted responsibly on 14 of his 17 SOR debts, and there is 
insufficient evidence of a track record of voluntary payments to his SOR creditors to 
support a conclusion that he will resolve his delinquent SOR debts in the near future.  
  
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative;  
 
Both disqualifying conditions apply. When Applicant completed his October 6, 
2010 SF-86, he falsely denied that he was had been delinquent over 180 days on any 
debts; and he denied that he was currently delinquent for more than 90 days on any 
debts. (SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.d) He was aware that he had multiple debts that were 
currently delinquent over 180 days. He deliberately failed to disclose information about 
his delinquent debts because he was worried that the contractor would not hire him. I 
have credited Applicant with mitigating SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, and 2.e because he may not 
have understood the definitions of terms such as liens, defaults, and repossessions. He 
made two payments on his IRS tax lien, and he may not have fully understood the 
status of his IRS debt as delinquent after the IRS intercepted two of his tax refunds.      
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
None of the mitigating conditions apply to SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.d. Applicant’s 
deliberately false statements on his October 6, 2010 SF-86 that he did not have any 
delinquent debts over 180 days delinquent and over 90 days currently delinquent are 
not mitigated. No one misled him into thinking this information should not be reported on 
his SF-86. The questions are clear, he is intelligent and he understood that the negative 
financial information was reportable. He did not report his delinquent debts because he 
wanted to obtain employment from a defense contractor. His false statements on his 
October 6, 2010 SF-86 are serious and relatively recent. Personal conduct concerns are 
not mitigated.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those two guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There are some facts supporting mitigation of security concerns under the whole-
person concept; however, they are insufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. There 
is no derogatory information concerning Applicant’s police records, illegal drug 
possession or use, or alcohol-related incidents. He is loyal to the United States. 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who is sufficiently 
intelligent and mature to understand and comply with security requirements. He 
understands what he must do to establish his financial responsibility. Over the last nine 
years, five events beyond Applicant’s control adversely affected his finances: (1) his 
spouse’s illness and death in July 2003; (2) his head injury and resulting medical bills in 
2007; (3) his two years of unemployment ending in September 2010; (4) the bad tax 
advice he received about receipt of funds from his 401K account being tax free; and (5) 
his dental bills. He received an award for being Employee of the Year in 2011. His 
character references and evaluations establish that he is a dedicated, reliable, and 
trustworthy employee. He is knowledgeable, patriotic, and professional, and he made 
substantial contributions to his employer. 
 
The financial circumstances and personal conduct evidence tending to support 
denial of Applicant’s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing towards 
approval of his clearance at this time. His SOR lists 17 delinquent debts totaling 
$44,518. Applicant currently has 14 delinquent SOR debts. Those 14 debts have been 
delinquent for more than two years. Applicant’s financial circumstances have been 
relatively stable since he obtained employment with a Government contractor in 
September 2010. He paid two debts totaling $77. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.h) He also paid the 
IRS $5,000 towards his tax lien when the IRS intercepted two of his tax refunds.  
However, he cannot receive full whole-person credit for resolving the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b 
because his payments were not fully voluntary. It is unclear why he did not more 
aggressively address some of his smaller SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.c for $175; 1.d for 
$260; 1.i for $95; 1.n for $99; and 1.p for $219) when he had the means to do so. He 
had an obligation to begin serious negotiations with his creditors and set up and start 
making payments towards some voluntary payment plans or to save up sufficient funds 
to make some lump sum payments to creditors. If he reduced his standard of living and 
expenses, he could increase his net funds available to address his SOR debts. There is 
no documentary evidence, such as receipts or cancelled checks, that any of the 14 
SOR creditors (except for the IRS) have received any payments. Applicant has failed to 
provide sufficient evidence of progress resolving his 14 delinquent SOR debts to 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
establish his financial responsibility. Applicant’s intentional failure to disclose derogatory 
financial information on his October 6, 2010 SF-86 is recent, serious, and not mitigated.    
   
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not fully 
mitigated the financial consideration and personal security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i to 1.n:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q: Against Applicant  
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    Against APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.c and 2.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.e:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
