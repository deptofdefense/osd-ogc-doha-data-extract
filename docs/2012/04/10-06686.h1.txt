Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of federal tax liens and more than
$100,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS. He has made payments to the IRS, and he
currently has an offer in compromise pending with the IRS. Looking forward, it is too
soon to predict if or when he will resolve his federal tax problems. Applicant failed to
present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns stemming from his
problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about1
October 20, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant
a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the
security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took
place March 12, 2012. The transcript (Tr.) was received March 23, 2012.  
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence in
addition to his Exhibits A–P, which were admitted at hearing. He made a timely post-
hearing submission and those matters are admitted, without objections, as follows:
• Exhibit Q–two letters of recommendation;
• Exhibit R–documents related to the state tax matter;
• Exhibit S–documents related to the federal tax matter;
• Exhibit T–document related to a 401(k) loan;
• Exhibit U–military retiree account statement;
• Exhibit V–two recent paychecks;
• Exhibit X–copy of nursing license for his wife;
• Exhibit Y–copy of a bachelor’s degree, awarded in 2009, for his daughter; and
• Exhibit Z–credit report, dated March 2, 2012.
Ruling on Procedure
Under ¶ E3.1.17 of the Directive, ¶ 1.f of the SOR was amended to conform with
the evidence admitted during the hearing; namely, to reflect the correct state jurisdiction
in which Applicant was indebted on a state tax lien for about $5,000.2
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged the following six matters: (1) four federal tax liens filed against
Applicant in the amounts of $76,573, $12,024, $36,024, and $664; (2) a past-due
account for $502; and (3) a state tax lien filed against Applicant in the amount of $5,000.

In Applicant’s reply to the SOR, he admitted the federal tax matters and the past-due
account, but he denied the state tax matter, explaining he had no such debt with that
particular state. His admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated herein as
findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial
evidence.
Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been
continuously employed by that company since 1999. He is seeking to retain a security
clearance for his current job as an engineering technician. His employment history
includes nearly 24 years of active duty military service in the U.S. Army, which
concluded in 1991 with his retirement as a senior noncommissioned officer (pay grade
E-7).  He served as a communications electronics maintenance chief and as an3
infantryman during his more than two decades of honorable military service. His
educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in computer information systems
awarded in 1998.4
Applicant completed a security clearance application in March 2010, and it is that
application under review here.  In completing the application, he reported his federal tax5
matters as well as a state tax lien filed by a state department of revenue. Also in March
2010, he was interviewed as part of his background investigation.  He explained during6
the interview that the tax liens were the result of reduced income, student  loans that he
was paying, and that he had insufficient income to pay his taxes. He discussed and
admitted the three federal tax liens for $76,573, $12,024, and $36,024. He stated that
he was working with the IRS to resolve the matters. There was no mention of the
federal tax lien for $664. He also discussed and admitted the state tax lien for about
$5,000 for tax year 2008. He explained he had been making monthly payments of $300
to $400 and intended to pay it in full. 
At present, Applicant has resolved three of the six matters alleged in the SOR.
First, the federal tax lien filed in February 2006 for $664 is resolved, because it was paid
in September 2006 and then released.  In addition, although not alleged in the SOR, the7
documentary evidence shows a federal tax lien filed in 2006 for $14,846 was released
in July 2007.  Second, the past-due account for $502 is resolved. The account was paid8
in full in February 2011, before the SOR was issued.  Third, the state tax lien for about9

security clearance).

$5,000 is resolved.  Applicant’s employer received notice of the tax lien in December10
2009, and the notice indicated an amount due of $8,946. A garnishment or wage
attachment action started the same month resulting in semimonthly deductions from his
paycheck. His employer received notice that the state tax lien was released in August
2010, before the SOR was issued. The information from Applicant’s employer is
corroborated by credit reports from March 2010, March 2011, and March 2012, none of
which report a state tax lien for any amount.   11
For the three unresolved federal tax liens in the amounts of $76,573, $12,024,
and $36,024, Applicant is attempting to resolve these matters by working with the IRS.
He has paid approximately $13,000 to the IRS during 2011 and 2012.  He proposed an12
offer in compromise to the IRS to settle the back taxes for $20,000.  The IRS13
responded to him in August 2011, indicating that they had received his offer in
compromise, but required additional paperwork before it could be further considered.14
The most recent information from the IRS is a letter, dated January 18, 2012, indicating
the offer in compromise had been assigned for investigation.  The letter also tasked15
Applicant to provide additional information and documentation with a deadline of
February 17, 2012. It was not established at hearing if Applicant had met the deadline.
Applicant estimates he owes the IRS about $160,000 in back taxes.  At present, his16
offer in compromise is pending with the IRS.  
  
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As17
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt18

about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An19
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting21
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An22
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate23
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme24
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it27
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant28
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline29
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  30
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. The federal and state tax matters along with the past-due
account raise security concerns. These matters indicate inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of31 32
Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions, and
the facts also suggest a degree of financial irresponsibility.   
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a33
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;33
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
None of the mitigating conditions, individually or in combination, are sufficient to
overcome and mitigate the security concerns stemming from Applicant’s largely
unresolved and ongoing federal tax liens and back taxes. With that said, the federal tax
lien for $664, the past-due account for $502, and the state tax lien for about $5,000 are
resolved and no longer a concern. Accordingly, SOR ¶¶ 1.d–1.f are decided for
Applicant. 
For reasons not entirely clear from the record, Applicant fell behind on his federal
income tax obligations. The result was five tax liens, three of which are still in effect for
more than $100,000 in back taxes. He has not ignored this problem, as shown by the
release of two of the five liens and by paying about $13,000 during 2011–2012.
Nevertheless, his offer in compromise is pending, the IRS is under no obligation to
accept his offer, and the likelihood of the IRS accepting it is unknown at this time.
Applicant is facing more than $100,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS, and this is a
problem that will not be easily solved. Looking forward, it is too soon to predict if or
when he will resolve his federal tax problems. Indeed, during the hearing, Applicant did
not demonstrate that he had a firm command of the details of his financial situation.
Accordingly, SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.c are decided against Applicant. 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).34
8
The evidence of Applicant’s ongoing federal tax problems justifies current doubts
about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-
consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  In particular, I gave Applicant substantial34
credit for his many years of honorable military service, his good employment record,
and his favorable letters of recommendation. Although these matters weigh in his favor,
they are not enough to mitigate and overcome the security concerns. Based on the
evidence before me, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.c: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.d–1.f: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
