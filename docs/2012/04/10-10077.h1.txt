TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges seven delinquent accounts, 
totaling $90,167. His financial problems were caused by unemployment, separation, 
divorce, and the decline in real estate values. He paid two debts; two debts are 
disputed; two debts are in established payment plans; and one debt is under 
investigation. Applicant is financially responsible. He showed self-discipline and good 
judgment, and he made payments to his creditors. Financial considerations are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 2, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
May 11, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge 
for a determination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On July 28, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On October 6, 2011, 
Department Counsel completed a f ile of relevant material (FORM). The FORM 
amended SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. (Tr. 8-9; HE 2) On November 3, 2011, after receiving the 
FORM, Applicant requested a hearing. On December 21, 2011, Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On February 8, 2012, DOHA assigned 
Applicant’s case to me.  
 
On February 15, 2012, DOHA issued a hear ing notice, and on March 1, 2012, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. Applicant received 15 days of notice of the time and place 
of his hearing. (Tr. 9-11) At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits 
(GE 1-7), and A pplicant offered three exhibits. (Tr. 17-18; AE A-C) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 and AE A-C. (Tr. 18) Department Counsel did not 
object to my consideration of the additional exhibit that Applicant submitted on March 9, 
2012, and I admitted it. (Ex. D) On March 12, 2012, I received the transcript of the 
hearing. I held the record open until March 16, 2012, to permit Applicant to provide 
additional evidence. (Tr. 71-72, 80)   
 
Findings of Fact1
 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied responsibility for the seven debts 
listed in the SOR, and he provided explanatory documentation. (HE 3) After a thorough 
review of the evidence, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old field terminal operator, who maintains maintenance 
data on ships. (Tr. 25-26, 67) He graduated from high school in 1990, and he has 18 
college credit hours. (Tr. 19-21) He joined the Army in 1995. (Tr. 21) His initial military 
occupational specialty (MOS) was anti-armor infantry soldier (11I); he transferred to the 
MOS of unit level supply specialist (92Y); and in 2009, he reverted to his infantry MOS 
(11B). (Tr. 23-25) Applicant served in the active Army for a total of nine years and for 5 
½ years in the Army Reserves and Army National Guard. (Tr. 23-28) He married in 
1993, and his three children are ages 8, 12, and 16. (Tr. 31; GE 1) He was separated 
from his spouse in 2006, and they were divorced in January 2010. (GE 1) He pays $900 
per month in child support, using an allotment from his bank. (Tr. 31-32, 52-53) His child 
support is current. (Tr. 32) He has held an interim Secret clearance. (Tr. 29-30) He has 
worked for his current employer since February 2010. (Tr. 68; GE 1)

Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges seven delinquent accounts, totaling $90,167 as follows: 1.a is a 
telecommunications debt for $385; 1.b is a collection account for $668; 1.c is a debt to 
the Defense Finance and Accounting Office (DFAS) for $10,261; 1.d is a c ollection 
account, resulting from a repossessed vehicle for $14,480; 1.e is a collection account, 
resulting from a vehicle loan for $1,994; 1.f is a deficiency balance after a foreclosure of 
$17,279 (as amended); and 1.g is a second mortgage collection account for $45,100 
(as amended). (Tr. 8-9; HE 2) 
 
In April 2011, Applicant paid the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $385. 
(Tr. 34-36; HE 3) On February 8, 2011; March 14, 2011; and April 4, 2011, Applicant 
wrote the current collection agent for the account in SOR ¶ 1.b for $668 and asked for 
documentation to validate the collection action. (Tr. 36; HE 3) Applicant expressed an 
interest in settling the debt if valid and asked, in the alternative, for removal of this debt 
from his credit reports. (HE 3) He took responsibility for the debt; however, he was 
unsure which collection company currently held the debt. (Tr. 36-38) 
   
Applicant disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, which resulted from overpayments of 
his pay and allowances. (HE 4) DFAS intercepted Applicant’s tax refund, and his debt 
was paid down from $10,261 to $6,414. (Tr. 39-40, 43-44; HE 4) Applicant wrote his 
U.S. Senator and objected to DFAS’ handling of the debt. DFAS responded and 
admitted mistakes in the processing of the debt. DFAS explained to Applicant how he 
could apply for a DFAS waiver of the debt. (HE 3) If his request for a waiver is denied, 
Applicant will establish a payment plan. (Tr. 40-42; HE 3) A letter from DFAS indicated 
the debt was not being actively collected through the Internal Revenue Service. (Tr. 45; 
HE 3) On January 23, 2012, DFAS wrote that the debt was being audited, and then it 
would be evaluated for a waiver. (AE D at 14)  
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d for $14,480 resulted from a delinquent vehicle loan. (Tr. 
45) Applicant’s former spouse turned in the vehicle to the creditor. (Tr. 47) Applicant 
settled the debt for $5,200, and he has been paying $50 per month for 12 months. (Tr. 
45-46; HE 3; AE D at 8) On April 6, 2011, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e for $1,994 wrote 
that the debt was satisfied. (Tr. 47-48; HE 3)  
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f for $17,279 and 1.g for $45,100 resulted from two 
mortgages on hi s foreclosed residence. In 2004, Applicant purchased his and hi s 
spouse’s residence for about $255,000. (Tr. 48) The purchase did not include a down 
payment, and the loans were interest-only conventional loans. (Tr. 49) Applicant lived in 
the residence for about two years before he separated from his spouse. (Tr. 49) He 
unsuccessfully attempted to sell his residence. (Tr. 54) 
 
On March 28, 2011, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f wrote that a settlement agreement 
had been reached. (HE 3) The settlement agreement indicates that the original amount 
of the debt owed to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f was $180,400. (Tr. 55-63, 66; HE 3) The 
property was foreclosed, and the balance owed after the foreclosure on the note was 
$13,320. (HE 3) The agreement specified that Applicant’s debt for $17,279 was settled 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
for $5,000 to be paid at the rate of $55.51 per month for 10 years. (Tr. 55-63; HE 3) As 
part of his SOR response, Applicant provided proof of five payments on M arch 30, 
3011; April 22, 2011; May 24, 2011; June 21, 2011; and July 22, 2011. (HE 3) He has 
continuously made all of his payments for a year. (Tr. 58-59; AE A; D at 7) Applicant 
erroneously believed that both mortgage accounts were merged into the same debt, 
and he planned to find out what he needed to do to start payments on the second 
mortgage account of about $45,100. (Tr. 55-63)    
 
Several circumstances beyond Applicant’s control damaged his finances. 
Applicant and his wife separated, and she moved to another state with their three 
children. He was unable to sell the marital home because of the decline in real estate 
value. Without his spouse’s income and due to the requirement to provide child support, 
Applicant was unable to make payments. His residence went into foreclosure. Applicant 
was unemployed from May 2009 to February 2010. (Tr. 32)  
 
Applicant received financial counseling in February 2011. (Tr. 63) He assessed 
the possibility of using a debt consolidation company to make restitution to his creditors. 
(Tr. 64-65) Applicant decided he could best address his debts directly without the paid 
assistance of a third party. (Tr. 65) 
 
Applicant updated his personal financial statement (PFS) on March 3, 2012. (Ex. 
D at 2) His PFS showed gross monthly income of $4,125; net monthly income of 
$2,942; expenses of $1,450; debt payments of $1,226; and net remainder of $267. (Tr. 
69-70; GE 3 at 4; AE D at 2)  
 
Character Evidence2
 
 
Applicant was an Army staff sergeant. He provided military diplomas, academic 
evaluation reports, certificates of training, state National Guard awards, and numerous 
noncommissioned officer (NCO) evaluation reports. He is airborne and air assault 
qualified. He earned an expert infantryman badge, and he served in Kosovo. He earned 
various military awards, including two Army Commendation Medals, two Army 
Achievement Medals, two Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Service 
Medals, one Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, one Kosovo Campaign Medal, 
one Army Service Ribbon, one Overseas Service Ribbon, and one NATO Medal.  
 
As additional character evidence, Applicant included four letters of 
recommendation from past and current supervisors or coworkers. Applicant’s file 
establishes that he is a dedicated, honest, responsible, loyal, trustworthy, and reliable 
NCO, who provided excellent leadership to subordinates and contributed to mission 
accomplishment.

reports, award nominations, award certificates, diplomas, certificates of release or discharge from active 
duty (DD Form 214), training certificates, and letters of recommendation. (AE B, C)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 ( 1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a n exus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and r egulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a hi story of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR and credit reports allege seven delinquent accounts, totaling 
$90,167. Several of Applicant’s debts became delinquent at least four years ago. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on t he individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a b usiness 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a deat h, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Unemployment, separation, divorce, and the precipitous decline in real 
estate values had a negative effect on Applicant’s financial circumstances and caused 
several debts to become delinquent. He paid two debts: 1.a for $385, and 1.e for 
$1,994. He has established payment plans on two debts: 1.d for $14,480, and 1.f for 
$17,279. He is disputing two debts: 1.b for $668, and 1.c for $10,261. He is 
investigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g for $45,100.3
 
 Circumstances largely beyond his 
control caused his financial problems. He is acting responsibly under the circumstances.    
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the applicant had $41,000 in delinquent 
credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. 
Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month the administrative judge 
issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently 
divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her 
former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child support. The Appeal Board 
determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that 
applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the administrative judge’s decision was 
                                            
3Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because a substantial amount of his DFAS 
debt was paid when the IRS intercepted his federal income tax refund, and he did not establish his 
payment plans in a timelier manner.

issued. The Appeal Board also decided that the record evidence raised the applicability 
of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence4
  
 of irresponsible behavior, poor 
judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant who had been sporadically unemployed 
lacked the ability to pay his creditors, noting that “it will be a long time at best before he 
has paid” all of his creditors. That applicant was living on unemployment compensation 
at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a circumstance was 
not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a 
serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3

ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the administrative judge’s decision denying 
a security clearance to the applicant because it did not “articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the administrative judge did “not explain[] 
what he believes that applicant could or should have done under the circumstances that 
he has not already done t o rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach 
taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light of his limited circumstances.” Id.

5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good -faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a l egally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

understands how to establish his financial responsibility and eliminate delinquent debt. 
Although he did not maintain contact with all of his creditors,6
 
 Applicant established that 
he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He attempted to sell his residence 
before it went into foreclosure. Due to separation, divorce, unemployment, and lack of 
income, and the decline in real estate values, his residence was foreclosed, resulting in 
$62,379 of the $90,167 SOR debt (69%). His financial problem is being resolved or is 
under control. He is taking reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his debts, 
showing some good faith.  
AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to the two debts he is disputing: 1.b for $668, and 1.c for 
$10,261.  Applicant assures if his disputes are unsuccessful, he will establish payment 
plans. DOHA can reassess his compliance with his promises at any time. See n. 7, 
infra. 
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts because of separation, divorce, 
unemployment, and the decline in real estate values. After he became consistently 
employed, he made substantial progress investigating and pay ing his debts. He has 
paid over $7,000 to address his SOR debts. It is unlikely that financial problems will 
recur. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. 
Assuming, financial considerations concerns are not mitigated under AGs ¶ 20, security 
concerns are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and r ecency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an ov erall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
                                            
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old field terminal operator. He is a high school graduate 
with 18 college credit hours. He served in the active Army for a total of nine years and 5 
½ years in the Army Reserves and Army National Guard. He has three children, and he 
is current on his $900 per month child support payments. He has worked for his current 
employer since February 2010 w ithout security violations. He is a dedicated, honest, 
responsible, and trustworthy NCO, who provided excellent leadership to subordinates 
and contributed to mission accomplishment. He is sufficiently mature to understand and 
comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering 
to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor and an Army Soldier. 
There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. His 
separation, divorce, unemployment, and the decline in real estate values contributed to 
his financial woes.  
 
Applicant has paid over $7,000 to address his SOR debts, and the majority of his 
debts are either paid or in established payment plans. The Appeal Board has addressed 
a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an appl icant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted). Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands how to budget 
and what he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. Moreover, 
he has established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident he 
will keep his promise to pay his delinquent debts7
                                            
7Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a c learance now does not bar the 
 because of his track record of

financial progress shown over the last two years since becoming employed by his 
current employer. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 ( 1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are fully mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.

to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional 
clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case
