Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant had an automobile repossessed and he lost his house through foreclosure.
He has numerous unpaid delinquent debts that he lacks the financial resources to satisfy.
Clearance is denied.
On April 13, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on May 9, 2012. He admitted
all SOR allegations, and he requested a hearing.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS
2 Applicant waived any potential lack of compliance with the 15-day notice requirement on the record
(Tr. 13-14).

The case was assigned to me on July 18, 2012. A notice of hearing was issued on
August 6, 2012, scheduling the hearing for August 22, 2012.2 The hearing was conducted
as scheduled. The Government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant
testified and submitted nine documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits
(AE) 1-9 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on
September 7, 2012.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor
since August 2010. He previously worked with the same defense contractor through a
temporary agency from September 2009 until August 2010. Applicant’s current work
assignment is as a range technician responsible for setting up test sites. Applicant was paid
$10 an hour when he worked through the temporary agency. He was hired at $13 an hour
by the defense contractor, and he received a pay increase to $15 an hour about four
months ago. Applicant’s performance evaluations and letters of recommendation from
supervisors and co-workers establish that he is a valued employee who is considered to
be hard working, dependable, trustworthy, and dedicated to his family and community.  
Applicant graduated from high school in June 1997. He was self-employed doing
carpentry work from July 1999 until November 2006. He worked as a customer service
representative in a retail store from April 2006 until November 2006. He was employed as
a carpenter from November 2006 until he was laid off sometime in or about 2008. He
worked with his brother doing whatever carpentry work they could find from May 2008 until
September 2009. 
Applicant was first married in December 2000. That marriage ended by divorce in
September 2007. He has been remarried since August 2010. Applicant has one child and
one step-child who both live with him. 
Applicant lost his house through foreclosure in or about 2008. He had an automobile
repossessed in 2007. His credit reports disclose 20 other delinquent accounts owing in the
combined amount of almost $8,000. His delinquent accounts date as far back as March
2005, when a cable television bill became delinquent in the amount of $224. Applicant has
not made any payment on any of his delinquent debts. Although not alleged in the SOR,
Applicant still has not filed his federal income tax returns for the 2010 and 2011 tax years.
He does not know if he owes the Government anything or if he has a refund due, and he
could not provide any reason for not filing the returns.

Applicant attributes his delinquent accounts to the unemployment and
underemployment he experienced beginning in or about 2008. He testified his net monthly
pay is currently about $900 every two weeks, and that he used to net about $900 per week
before he lost his full-time carpentry job. He currently lacks the financial resources to make
any payment toward any account. Applicant testified he has consulted with an attorney
about filing for bankruptcy and is in the process of saving money to accumulate the $1,800
required before the attorney will file a petition. He presently has saved $600 toward the
attorney’s fee and the court costs.   
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision must be a fair
and impartial decision based upon relevant and material facts and circumstances, the
whole-person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive.
Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against
clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Guideline F (financial
considerations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case.
  The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.3 The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.4 The burden of
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.6 “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the
evidence.”7 Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
her.8 Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable
clearance decision.9
No one has a right to a security clearance10 and “the clearly consistent standard
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
11 Id. at 531.
12 Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.

denials.”11  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to
classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.12     
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant had a vehicle repossessed in 2007, and he lost his house through
foreclosure in 2008. He has numerous delinquent accounts, owing in the combined amount
of almost $8,000, that date as far back as March 2005. He has not made any payment on
any of those accounts, and he lacks the financial resources to make any payment toward
them or to even seek bankruptcy protection. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability
or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations
apply.
Applicant attributes his financial problems to periods of unemployment and
underemployment he experienced from sometime in or about 2008 until he acquired
replacement full-time employment in September 2009. His financial problems have only
been partially alleviated due to his current income being only about one-half of what he
earned when he worked as a full-time carpenter. However, Applicant allowed several
accounts to become delinquent when he was working full time and earning a net weekly
income of about $900, and did nothing to resolve those accounts while he maintained that
full-time employment. He was single from September 2007 until August 2010, and he did
nothing to resolve any of his accounts during that time period. Applicant has only relatively
recently decided to pursue bankruptcy protection, and, based upon the fact that he appears
to be living paycheck to paycheck, it is uncertain how long it will take him to accumulate the
needed funds to pursue a bankruptcy option.
Based on the above, Applicant is entitled to limited application of Mitigating
Condition MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly
under the circumstances.
Applicant’s financial problems are long-term, ongoing, and unlikely to be resolved
in the foreseeable future. There is no evidence to suggest he has obtained any sort of
financial counseling. Although not alleged in the SOR, his failure to file his most recent
5
federal income tax returns, not even knowing if he is due a refund, demonstrates a
complete disregard of his financial responsibilities. Nothing in the record indicates Applicant
will assume a financially responsible lifestyle in the foreseeable future.  I have considered
the following mitigating conditions and conclude they do not apply: MC 20(a): the behavior
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. The remaining mitigating conditions
have no applicability to the facts of this case. 
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, the whole-person concept, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the
financial considerations security concern. He has neither overcome the case against him
nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-v: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
