MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant owes less than $1,000 in past-due medical debt, but his evidence falls 
short of disproving his liability for a $25,000 judgment awarded a former landlord in 
September 2010. He has made no payments toward the judgment. Applicant is paying his 
current debts on time, but his handling of the landlord-tenant dispute continues to raise 
doubts about his financial judgment. Clearance denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 14, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him security clearance eligibility. DOHA took 
the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
 
 
 2 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department 
of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant submitted an undated Answer to the SOR allegations, and he requested a 
hearing. On June 6, 2012, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to consider 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. On June 7, 2012, I scheduled a hearing for June 25, 2012. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Seven Government exhibits (GEs 1-7) and 
two Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted without objection. Applicant also testified, 
as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 2, 2012. The record was held open 
following the hearing. As noted below, four additional Government exhibits (GEs 8-11) and 
ten additional Applicant exhibits (AEs C-L) were admitted. 
 
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings 
 
I held the record open after the hearing, initially until July 17, 2012, for Applicant to 
submit additional documents. Applicant timely forwarded through Department Counsel 
seven exhibits, which were accepted into the record without objection as AEs C-I. 
 
Review of AEs C-I led me to reopen the record for clarification. On August 2, 2012, I 
notified both parties of my intent to consider pertinent sections of the state’s landlord and 
tenant statutes,
1
 subject to objections and comments within 15 days of receipt of the Order. 
Applicant was granted 15 days from receipt of the Order to submit clarification and if 
appropriate, documentation addressing the judgment award and his appeal. Applicant 
received the Order on August 4, 2012. On August 5, 2012, Applicant submitted an email 
message addressing some of the issues in the Order. His email was marked and entered 
as AE J. On August 19, 2012, Applicant provided information in an email message (AE K). 
Documents submitted via a separate email were admitted collectively as AE L. Applicant 
exhibits AE J-L were admitted without objection. 
 
On August 21, 2012, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 8-11) for 
inclusion in the record. One copy of each document was forwarded to Applicant for his 
review and comment by August 31, 2012. Applicant did not file a response by the due date. 
On September 6, 2012, Applicant objected to proposed GE 8, a contemporaneous 
newspaper article dated January 28, 2010, reporting Applicant’s involvement in the 
landlord-tenant dispute that led to the judgment in SOR 1.a. Applicant objected in that the 
reporter was not present in the courtroom, never spoke to him, and did not clearly identify 
the source of the information. Given the article’s relevance and its preparation in the 
normal course of business by a reporter, who indicates he reviewed the court documents, I 
admitted GE 8 as a full exhibit for consideration in light of all the evidence before me for 
review. GEs 9-11 were admitted without objection.

were set forth in my Order of August 2, 2012.

Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of February 14, 2012, Applicant owed a 
judgment debt around $25,000 from 2010 (SOR 1.a), six medical debts in collection 
totaling $1,453 (SOR 1.b-g, 1.i), and a $238 utility debt in collection (SOR 1.h). Applicant 
indicated that he had legal counsel to contest the judgment. He denied the debts in SOR 
1.b-1.c, and 1.g-1.i on the basis that they had been paid, and the hospital debt in SOR 1.e 
without explanation. Applicant admitted the medical debts in SOR 1.d and 1.f, which were 
copay obligations on which he was making payments. After considering the pleadings, 
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 47 years old, divorced, and has a graduate equivalency diploma. He has 
been employed by a defense contractor since January 2011 (Tr. 50), and he requires a 
confidential security clearance for his present duties. (GEs 1, 3.) He started as an 
assembler and now drills cabinets. (Tr. 39, 50-51.) 
 
Applicant was married from May 1990 to September 2002. He and his ex-wife had 
two children together. Applicant raised the children from when their daughter and son were 
six and nine years of age. (Tr. 35.) Applicant’s son is now 21 and serving in the U.S. 
military. (GE 1; Tr. 38.) Applicant’s daughter moved in with her mother two years ago, when 
she turned 16. (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant was ordered to pay child support of $87 per week in 
June 2011 because of his reemployment. He paid an additional $75 per month toward an 
arrearage of $658, which has been satisfied. (GEs 1, 2.) Applicant is no longer required to 
pay child support because his daughter turned 18 in June 2012. (Tr. 38.) 
 
In June 2005, Applicant began employment as a yard worker with a lumber 
company. He cohabited with his then girlfriend in her home. In 2006, Applicant injured his 
shoulder at work. (Tr. 35.) He was out of work approximately four months after shoulder 
surgery. (GE 3.) Applicant incurred medical debt at a local hospital, of $428.80 in May 2006 
(SOR 1.d) and $383.04 (SOR 1.f) in February 2007, for which he had payment 
responsibility (amounts applied to deductible) that went unpaid.
2
 (GE 4.) 
 
In May 2007, Applicant took over the mortgage on his girlfriend’s home. He took out 
a loan of $140,000 to be repaid at $1,157 per month. Applicant paid the mortgage on time 
through October 2007. In November 2007, Applicant sustained a second shoulder injury on 
the job (Tr. 35, 53), and he could not afford the monthly mortgage payment on his 
workmen’s compensation income.
3
 (Tr. 53.) He returned to work on light duty around 
March or April 2008, when the owner of the business “snapped” on seeing Applicant’s arm 
                                                 
2
Applicant testified that the debts were for his daughter’s care. (Tr. 36.) Hospital billing records show that 
Applicant was the patient. (GE 4.) Applicant incurred charges for his daughter in May 2008, for which he had a 
$15 copayment. (GE 2.) 
 
3
Applicant may well have prevailed in a workmen’s compensation claim against his former employer. Applicant 
indicated in an email to Department Counsel on July 8, 2012, that he had $45,000 from a workmen’s 
compensation case. (AE D.) 
 
 
 4 
in a sling, and he threw a paint can at him. Pending a workmen’s compensation settlement, 
Applicant remained an employee until October 2008. (GEs 1, 3.) Applicant made no effort 
to resume the mortgage payments, and in January 2010, the mortgage holder waived any 
claim for deficiency against Applicant, who surrendered the deed in lieu of foreclosure. 
(GEs 3, 6, 7; Tr. 35, 54.) 
 
In June 2008, Applicant moved with his children into a basement apartment in a 
house rented by his brother and sister-in-law. His sister-in-law leased the home at rent of 
$1,600 per month. (GE 8.) Applicant had no written lease.
4
 (GE 3; Tr. 65-67.) In October 
2008, he began working part time as a security guard. (GE 1; Tr. 55.) Around December 
2008, water penetrated the basement walls. Applicant contacted the absentee landlord, 
who he asserts told him to repair the problem and take the cost off the rent. Applicant paid 
$600 per month in rent from July 2008 through January 2009 to the property owner. (GE 3; 
AE G.) Copies of the checks confirm they were cashed, but it is unclear by whom in that 
the checks do not bear the endorsement of the landlord. One check made out to the 
property owner bears Applicant’s endorsement, which he attributes to his own error. (AE J.) 
 
Starting in February 2009, neither Applicant nor his brother paid any rent to the 
landlord. (GE 8.) Applicant claims he spent between $9,000 and $15,000 for repairs to the 
property.
5
 (GE 3; AEs D, K.) He provided no corroboration by way of contractor bills or 
proof of payments, but photos of the property showed significant need for repairs. (AEs H, 
L.) Applicant asserted that his brother vacated the home in February 2009 (GE 3), but 
according to a news report, Applicant’s brother and sister-in-law remained in the property 
until November 2009, when the property owner issued an eviction notice. (GE 8.) 
 
According to Applicant, on February 23, 2009, he was authorized by the property 
owner to move upstairs at a rent of $600 per month, and the property owner promised to 
reimburse him for repair costs.

Under § 540:1 of the pertinent state law, every tenancy or occupancy is deemed to be at will, and the rent 
payable upon demand, unless a different contract is shown. Under § 540:1-a(I), single-family houses rented 
for residential purposes are considered “nonrestricted property” if the landlord did not own more than 3-single 
family houses at any one time. Pursuant to § 540:2, the lessor or owner of nonrestricted property may 
terminate any tenancy by giving to the tenant or occupant a notice in writing to quit the premises in accordance 
with § 540:3 (requiring 30 days notice) and § 540:5 (requiring service of notice of demand for rent or eviction). 
 
5
Applicant admits that he did not pay rent, but only for six or seven months before he vacated under court 
order. (Tr. 82.)

On Monday February 23, 2009, someone (author and recipient redacted in AE F) sent the following message: 
“The water bill to the amount of $600 was paid today in accordance with RSA 540:2 check #200 and your 
balance is $35.” Later that day, the landlord reportedly sent the following message to Applicant regarding the 
water bill: 
 
Thank you for taking care of this, today. You can if you want to move upstairs where i made a 
mistake on the apartment where you rent now i am sorry for all of the problems i have caused 
I took out the anger i had with joe and put it on you and for that i am sorry. U can live in the 
house till you get out and do pay $600 per month for house I will pay all reimbuse [sic] you 
have pade [sic] for repars [sic]. (AE F.) 
 
 
 5 
checks through January 2009 (AE G), then refused to cover some repair costs, some of 
which were unrelated to the water damage (AEs H, L; Tr. 66) and not expressly authorized. 
Around April 2009, Applicant filed a lawsuit in superior court for almost $50,000 against his 
landlord for the repair costs and for renting him an apartment in a single-family residence in 
violation of zoning regulations. (GEs 3, 8; Tr. 65-66.) 
 
In October 2009, the landlord began eviction proceedings against Applicant’s 
brother and sister-in-law after they failed to pay their $1,600 monthly rent for eight 
consecutive months. On November 16, 2009, the court ordered Applicant, his brother, and 
his sister-in-law to show cause why they should not be evicted. (AE L.) After an eviction 
notice was issued, Applicant failed to vacate the property. Applicant contested the eviction 
in court, contending that he had repaired the property in lieu of rent, and that the landlord 
had told him he would reimburse him for repairs. The landlord denied ever agreeing to pay 
Applicant for work done on the house. On January 6, 2010, a district court part-time special 
justice found that Applicant had misrepresented to the court that he had a signed lease 
executed by the property owner. Since Applicant was not a party to the lease, he had no 
legal or equitable right as a tenant. The justice ordered Applicant to vacate by January 14, 
2010.
7
 Under state law, any decision rendered by the court related to a money judgment 
was limited to a maximum of $1,500 at that time, although either party could file a 
subsequent claim for any additional amounts. No money was awarded the landlord at that 
time. (AE K.) 
 
 In late January 2010, Applicant withdrew his lawsuit against the property owner. (GE 
8.) During his background investigation, Applicant indicated that the justice dismissed his 
suit in superior court against the landlord because it was the same case as the landlord’s 
dispute. (GE 3.) Applicant’s current explanation is that his case against the landlord “fell 
apart” because an intended witness died of a drug overdose, and the justice and the 
landlord were friends.
8
 (Tr. 37.) 
                                                                                                                                                             
In response to my inquiries about the author of the first message and who bore responsibility for paying the 
water bill, Applicant indicated the water bill was the landlord’s responsibility. (AE I.) Yet, Applicant testified at 
his hearing that he paid a water bill because the landlord owed “$800 and something.” (Tr. 65.) If Applicant 
sent the initial email of February 23, 2009, to inform the landlord that he had paid the water bill, it shows he 
was aware of his rights as a tenant under the law.  Section 540:2 referenced in the email provides that no 
tenancy shall be terminated for nonpayment of rent if the tenant was forced to take over the landlord’s utility 
payments in order to prevent utility services, which the landlord agreed to provide, from being terminated. The 
reply presumably from the landlord is evidence of Applicant’s rent being $600 per month.  Applicant has no 
evidence of an agreement other than the email, which he asserts was addressed in court but dismissed by the 
judge after the landlord claimed he sent it in error. (AE K.) Even if I accept the email as a binding agreement 
between the parties, it indicates that the landlord would reimburse Applicant what he had paid for repairs, but it 
does not address whether the landlord would cover any future repairs. Nor does it authorize Applicant to make 
repair decisions at his discretion. It requires Applicant to continue his $600 monthly payments. Applicant did 
not present any receipts verifying the nature, cost, or date of repairs. It is insufficient for Applicant to provide 
the telephone number and address of a contractor to whom he indicates he paid over $9,000. (AE K.) 
 
7 
Shortly before vacating the property, Applicant apparently put a sign in the front yard stating that the landlord 
owed more than $15,000 in delinquent real estate taxes. The tax collector’s records showed that $15,944 in 
back taxes were owed. (GE 8.) 
 
8 
When asked later by Department Counsel about his lawsuit against the landlord, Applicant testified that he 
 
 6 
 
 Applicant paid no rent after January 2009, even though he lived in the house until 
January 2010, when he vacated under court order. (GE 3.) The property owner 
subsequently sued Applicant in district court for unpaid rent and for removing two trees 
from the property without authorization. (GEs 3, 8.) Applicant testified that the landlord 
wanted $5,000 in back rent, and on the estimate of an arborist, $20,000 to replace the 
trees. On September 1, 2010, after a hearing on the merits, the justice entered a judgment 
for the property owner in the amount of $25,000 plus costs (SOR 1.a). The justice decided 
the landlord was entitled to 12 months of rent at $1,600 per month or $19,200, $20,000 to 
cure the damage to the trees, and $500 in costs for replacement of a camper and trailer, 
although the total damage award was limited to the statutory recovery amount of $25,000.

(AE E.)  
 
 In 2008, Applicant became a member of his town’s conservation commission, 
devoting his spare time to stopping illegal dumping, reporting violations of wildlife 
conservation laws, and working on the community garden. (GE 9.) In September 2009, 
Applicant took a second job as a substitute custodian for a school district to supplement his 
income as a security guard. In January 2011, he began working as an assembler for his 
defense contractor employer. (GE 1.) By then, medical debts totaling $1,454 from 2006 
and 2007 had been placed for collection due to nonpayment. (GE 5.) On December 9, 
2010, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) for a security clearance. Applicant responded “Yes” to 26.e concerning any judgments 
against him in the last seven years and 26.m concerning whether he had been over 180 
days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years. He listed the $25,000 judgment 
awarded the landlord, who he indicated was abusive. He also listed the delinquent 
mortgage that was resolved through surrender of the deed. (GE 1.) 
                                                                                                                                                             
“just dropped it,” as the landlord’s wife was “wanted for a $100,000 fraud case” and others told him he was 
“nuts” to pursue the landlord, who had reportedly “stiffed everybody . . . owed $27,000 in property taxes.” (Tr. 
72.) The justice was apparently reprimanded by the state’s judicial conduct committee in July 2011 for making 
inappropriate comments or inquiries to defendants and the local prosecutor in three cases unrelated to 
Applicant’s problems with the property owner. (AE C.) 
 
9
The evidentiary record does not contain the transcript of the hearing or any explanation from the justice 
explaining his rationale for his decision. It is unclear what evidence Applicant presented on his behalf before 
the district court, although Applicant testified as follows: 
 
When it came time for my attorney to speak, the judge says I don’t want to hear about it, 
you’ll receive my decision in the mail . . . . [The opposing attorney] said that [I] failed to pay 
rent and [I] never did this and he wasn’t—he said [I] was an illegal tenant. How was I an 
illegal tenant, you cashed my checks, and the judge didn’t want to hear it. That’s what, when 
we left, my lawyer said something is wrong here. [Attorney name omitted], my attorney, he 
goes something is wrong here. Then all of a sudden, probably three, four, five weeks later we 
get a notice in the mail, and he says he ruled against you for 25 grand. I don’t know how he 
ruled against you for 25 grand, he goes there wasn’t $25,000 involved. (Tr. 83.)  
 
There is no indication that Applicant’s sister-in-law or brother was named as a defendant, even though his 
sister-in-law was the signatory to the lease, and the justice had previously ruled that Applicant had no rights as 
a tenant. 
 
 
 7 
 
 A check of Applicant’s credit on December 28, 2010, revealed the unpaid medical 
debts in collection and a $238 utility debt in collection since June 2010 (SOR 1.h). Also, 
Applicant owed credit card balances of $382 and $2,175 on which he was making 
payments according to terms. (GE 5.) 
 
 On January 18, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the OPM 
about the $25,000 judgment and mortgage delinquency that led to the loss of his home. 
Applicant indicated that his attorney advised him not to make any payment on the 
judgment before the landlord could be reached. Applicant expressed his intent to do 
whatever his attorney advises. On January 25, 2011, Applicant was re-contacted to 
complete his interview. When reviewing the financial inquiries on his e-QIP, Applicant was 
asked to confirm whether he had owed any delinquent debts other than the judgment and 
mortgage in the last seven years. Applicant responded, “No.” He was then informed about 
the collection debts on his credit report. He disputed their validity, in that the medical debts 
were to have been paid by workmen’s compensation, and he believed he paid the utility 
debt in full when he vacated the rental unit where the charges were incurred. Applicant 
expressed his intent to pay any medical bills proven to be legitimate. (GE 3.) 
 
 After his interview, Applicant verified the utility debt and all but one of the medical 
debts (SOR 1.e) on his credit record. (GE 4.) Between July and September 2011, he paid 
$148 toward his medical debts. (GE 3.) On September 7, 2011, Applicant provided DOHA 
with evidence of the $148 payments. He also indicated that he had “nothing new” 
concerning the judgment. Medical debts of $80, $125 (SOR 1.c), $468 (SOR 1.d), $265 
(SOR 1.e), and $383 (SOR 1.f) were on his list to be paid. Applicant indicated that a $99 
debt for radiology services (SOR 1.i) was paid by workmen’s compensation on June 12, 
2011. Concerning the $238 utility debt (SOR 1.h), Applicant averred that the current 
balance was $38 and would be paid in full his next pay period. (GE 2.) On November 12, 
2011, Applicant informed DOHA that he intended to have all his old medical debts satisfied 
by April 2012. (GE 3.) 
 
 In January 2012, Applicant paid the debt in SOR 1.c. (GE 4.) On February 14, 2012, 
DOHA issued an SOR alleging that Applicant owed $1,691 in outstanding collection 
balances and the $25,000 judgment debt. By then, Applicant owed only two outstanding 
medical debts, $428.80 (SOR 1.d) and $383.04 (SOR 1.f), and the judgment (SOR 1.a). 
(GE 4.) Applicant intends to pay the $383.04 in a lump sum and the $428.80 in two 
payments once he has a $633 federal tax debt paid off. (Tr. 63-64.)  When Applicant filed 
his federal income tax return for 2011 in April 2012, he did not have the funds to pay the 
taxes owed. The IRS has given him until early August 2012 to pay his past-due tax debt in 
full. (Tr. 75-78.) As of late June 2012, Applicant had made one payment of $250. (Tr. 63.) 
  
 As of July 2012, Applicant had made no payments toward the judgment, reportedly 
on the advice of his attorney, and he did not intend to make any payments until directed to 
do so by his lawyer. (GE 3; AE G; Tr. 38, 70-73.) On June 12, 2012, the attorney confirmed 
his legal representation, but he shed no light on any advice given to Applicant regarding 
appealing or paying the judgment. (AE A.) The attorney agreed to represent him in return 
 
 8 
for some work Applicant had done for him. (Tr. 84.) In an email of July 5, 2012, Applicant 
informed Department Counsel that his attorney had advised him that since the landlord had 
moved out of the area, “we should let the issue die.”
10
 (AE C.) 
 
 Post-hearing, Applicant was asked to document his appeal of the September 2010 
monetary judgment to the district court. Applicant learned that his attorney, who was not 
returning his calls, did not file an appeal. (AE K.) There is no evidence that the landlord is 
attempting to collect the judgment. Should Applicant be required by the court to pay the 
judgment, he understands that the state would assess an amount for automatic deduction 
directly from his wages. (Tr. 89.) 
  
Applicant lives with his mother and stepfather. He pays rent of $150 per week. (Tr. 
41-42.) A shift worker for the defense contractor, Applicant is paid $16.26 per hour, time 
and a half on Saturdays, and double time on Sundays. Applicant worked two Sundays and 
one Saturday in the weeks before his hearing. He plans to put the extra earnings toward 
his bills. (Tr. 87-88.) Applicant also works one to two days per month on average as an on-
call custodian for the school system at $9.75 an hour. (Tr. 47, 89.) Applicant drives a 2004 
model-year pickup truck that he owns outright after paying off a $14,924 loan in 2007. (GE 
5; Tr. 44.) As of late June 2012, he had two credit card accounts, which were both current, 
on which he owed balances around $2,200 and $600. (Tr. 44.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence

According to the landlord and tenant writ (AE L), the landlord was a nonresident of the state when he filed for 
eviction in November 2009. The landlord, who operates a property management and home improvement 
business in his state of residence (GE 10), remains a nonresident owner of the property. (GE 11.)

contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns for Financial Considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Guideline F notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, including 
AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not 
meeting financial obligations.” As of January 2011, Applicant owed about $1,150 in medical 
debt and $238 in utility debt in collection. A $25,000 judgment was issued against him in 
September 2010 for unpaid rent and property damage. Security concerns are established 
under AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). 
 
 Concerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior 
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply in light of the relatively recent 
judgment award that has yet to be resolved. The two largest medical debts, which total 
$811.84, also have not been satisfied. 
 
 
 10 
 Applicability of AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem 
were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” is limited to the medical debts arising from 
Applicant’s unforeseen injury at work. That being said, Applicant had a responsibility to 
ensure that copay and deductible balances were paid by him or by his workmen’s 
compensation benefit. He was awarded around $45,000 for his injury claim and apparently 
just assumed that all medical expenses would be covered. As for the judgment debt, 
Applicant had no control over whether his brother and sister-in-law paid their rent. Yet, in 
the absence of any evidence that the landlord waived rent in return for repairs, it is difficult 
to find that Applicant acted responsibly, even if I accept that the landlord agreed to pay for 
repairs made to the premises. Applicant lived in the home without paying any rent from 
February 2009 to January 2010 after the landlord expressly directed him to continue to pay 
rent at $600 per month. His obligation to pay rent is legally distinguishable from a claim for 
reimbursement of repair costs from the landlord. AG ¶ 20(b) does not fully mitigate the 
financial judgment concerns. 
 
 Applicant’s satisfaction of the smaller medical debts and the utility debt implicate AG 
¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there 
are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 
20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.” Yet, it is difficult to fully apply either AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d) in mitigation 
when he has an outstanding judgment debt of $25,000 against him on which he has made 
no payments. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
applies to the debt in SOR 1.e, which Applicant denies. The debt appears on Applicant’s 
December 2010 credit report (GE 5) as a collection debt, but the hospital’s statement of 
account show only the debts alleged in SOR 1.d and 1.f are owed. (GE 4.) 
 
 Applicant’s challenge to the validity of the judgment debt warrants considerable 
discussion. The property owner’s deposit of the rent checks from Applicant between July 
2008 and January 2009 could be construed as giving Applicant a tenancy-at-will, even if 
Applicant lacked the standing of a lessee. Under the state’s landlord and tenant statutes, 
the owner could terminate any residential tenancy by giving 30 days’ notice in writing to quit 
the premises. See RSA §§ 540:2, 540:3. If Applicant paid the water bill for the landlord in 
order to prevent his water from being shut off,
11
 his tenancy was still subject to termination 
because his rental arrearage would have exceeded the $600 or so paid to the water 
company on the property owner’s behalf. Applicant paid no rent between February 2009 
and January 2010, when he vacated the premises pursuant to court order. Applicant 
contends that since the landlord offered to reimburse him for repairs, he was somehow 
                                                 
11
The evidence as to whether Applicant paid the water bill is problematic. The author and recipient of the email 
are redacted without explanation. The email indicates that $600 was paid by the author, and that the 
recipient’s balance was $35.00. (AE F.) 
 
 11 
justified in not paying the rent. However, nothing in the email of February 23, 2009, cited as 
proof of the rent by Applicant, gave him the legal right to live in the premises rent free or to 
repair the premises in lieu of paying rent. At best, it authorized Applicant to remain in the 
house at rent of $600 per month and promised reimbursement of repair costs that he had 
already paid. Various photos of the property submitted by Applicant show the premises still 
in need of repair as of April 2009, June 2009, and January 2010, well after the February 
2009 email. Nothing in the email can be construed as a promise by the landlord to pay for 
future repairs or as authorization for Applicant to make repairs at his discretion. It appears 
that Applicant made repairs at his own risk. 
 
Applicant was held liable for the full $1,600 per month in unpaid rent, and he was 
not a lessee. There is no indication that the property owner filed for a judgment against 
Applicant’s sister-in-law for the unpaid rent from February 2009 until November 2009, when 
the landlord and tenant writ was issued for failure to vacate by November 16, 2009. 
Nonetheless, claims of the district court justice’s bias against him were not established by 
substantial evidence, which the DOHA Appeal Board has defined as “such relevant 
evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in 
light of all the contrary evidence in the record. Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1. ‘This is something less 
than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions 
from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s finding from being 
supported by substantial evidence.’ Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 
620 (1966).” See e.g., ISCR 07-15434 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009.) 
 
Applicant had an attorney that failed to appeal the judgment on his behalf. (AE A.) 
Applicant has not paid the attorney, who apparently took the case in return for repairs 
made by Applicant. I cannot speculate as to the extent of the lawyer’s professional 
responsibility to Applicant, who, if Applicant is to be believed, told him not to pay the 
judgment. Applicant indicated on July 5, 2012, that his attorney advised him that the 
property owner had moved away from the area, and they should let the issue die. (AE C.) 
Yet, as of August 19, 2012, Applicant appeared to be surprised at finding out that this 
attorney had “NEVER filed an appeal as he claimed he would.” (AE K.) Having filed a legal 
complaint against the landlord in the past, Applicant knew enough about the legal process 
to understand that he had an obligation to ensure that the judgment was either being 
appealed or being repaid. Photographs of property deterioration and repair do not satisfy 
Applicant’s burden in overcoming the financial concerns raised by an outstanding financial 
judgment of $25,000 that is yet to be resolved. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
12
 
                                                 
12 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
 
 12 
 
Applicant allowed several medical debts to go to collection. Yet, his medical debts 
were not discretionary, and he has satisfied many of them. The greater concern is raised 
by his ongoing disregard of the $25,000 judgment debt. Court records and a news report 
indicate that Applicant and other family members resided in the home without paying rent 
for ten months before the court granted possession to the property owner. Applicant 
contested his eviction without success. The judge found that Applicant misrepresented to 
the court that he had an agreement with the property owner that granted him legal tenancy. 
 
Applicant’s claims of a vindictive landlord, who reneged on promises to cover repair 
costs, and of a biased judge, cannot be summarily dismissed. The judge held Applicant 
responsible for the entire amount of the back rent, despite evidence that Applicant’s 
brother and sister-in-law also resided there until November 2009, and she was on the 
lease. Yet, as outlined above, the evidence proffered by Applicant is problematic in several 
aspects (email redacted without explanation; Applicant-endorsed check deposited to 
property owner’s account; repair expenses unsubstantiated by bills or payments on 
accounts; attorney’s failure to appeal judgment; conflicting testimony from Applicant about 
whether he had been in arrears on rent and about the circumstances of his lawsuit against 
the property owner). Photographs of the premises are not enough to legally justify his 
ongoing disregard of the judgment. Applicant presented no corroborating evidence that 
would sustain a finding that he relied reasonably to his detriment on legal advice to ignore 
the judgment. It is not enough to merely assert that his attorney is not returning his calls. 
 
The evidence does not show the property owner in a positive light. He owed $15,944 
in back taxes when Applicant was evicted. He assented to Applicant’s tenancy if he cashed 
the rent checks from Applicant covering the months from June 2008 through January 2009, 
and several of the photos from Applicant substantiate possible code violations. However, 
the property owner is not applying for a security clearance, and his eligibility is not before 
me. I can only base a decision on the evidence presented, which includes an outstanding 
financial judgment of $25,000 plus costs, a previous mortgage default, and a recent IRS 
debt that had to be repaid by early August 2012 in preference to him resolving his two 
largest medical debts in collection. Based on the evidence before me and the adjudicative 
guidelines that I am bound to consider, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.
