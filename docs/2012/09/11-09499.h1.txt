DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 19, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On March 22, 2012, Applicant answered the 
 
2 
 
 
SOR and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to another 
administrative judge on April 23, 2012, and was reassigned to me on July 18, 2012. 
DOHA originally issued Notices of Hearing on April 24, 2012, and April 27, 2012. A prior 
hearing session was held in this case on May 10, 2012; however, Applicant was unable 
to attend that session because of a death in his family. On August 6, 2012, another 
Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for August 28, 2012. The hearing 
was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 that were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Department Counsel’s list of exhibits was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant 
testified, called no witnesses, and offered no exhibits. The record was left open until 
September 11, 2012, for the Applicant to submit additional matters. Department 
Counsel’s memorandum advising that Applicant did not submit any post-hearing matters 
was marked as HE 2. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on September 7, 
2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old software test engineer who has worked for his current 
employer since April 2011. Another employer, a defense contractor, has offered him 
employment contingent upon him obtaining a security clearance. He served in the U.S. 
Army from June 1986 to March 1995, attained the grade of sergeant (E-5), and received 
an honorable discharge. He received a bachelor’s degree in computer science 
management in 2001. He has been married three times. His first two marriages ended 
in divorce. He married his current wife in December 2010. He has two daughters, ages 
16 and 19. He believes he held a security clearance in the Army and stated he had no 
security violations. He also held a public trust position in the past.1 
 
The SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts totaling $21,714. In his Answer to the 
SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. His admissions are incorporated as 
findings as fact.2 
 
Applicant testified openly and honestly at the hearing. He attributed his financial 
problems to his second divorce in 2004. As a result of that divorce, he incurred an IRS 
debt of about $15,000 that took him a long time to pay. He further indicated that he 
struggled to maintain his family while paying child support. In August 2010, he lost his 
job and was unemployed until about February 2011. He collected unemployment 
compensation during that period of unemployment. At the hearing, he also 
acknowledged that he has not lived up to his financial obligations and has not handled 
his finances properly. He stated that, with the exception of his child support arrearages 
and student loans, he expected to “get in front of” the other debts within the next six 
months. Previously, he made similar statements during an Office of Personnel

Management interview in February 2010. During that interview, he had indicated that he 
would pay a number of accounts by March or December 2010, but failed to do so. Each 
SOR allegation is addressed separately below.3 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – collection account for $1,876. This account was for an apartment 
that Applicant rented in 2005 and 2006. The date of last activity on this account was 
August 2008. This debt was placed for collection in October 2011. At the hearing, 
Applicant stated that he received a settlement offer from the creditor about six months 
ago, but has not made any payments to the creditor. This debt remains unresolved.4 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – collection account for $309. This debt was for an overdrawn 
checking account that Applicant had at a credit union. The date of last activity on this 
account was December 2008. This debt was placed for collection in October 2011. At 
the hearing, Applicant indicated that this debt remained unpaid.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – collection account for $99. This debt was for a returned check. The 
date of last activity on this account was August 2005. This debt was placed for 
collection in February 2006. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that this debt remained 
unpaid.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – charged-off account for $1,488. This debt was a loan from a credit 
union. The date of first delinquency/date of last activity on this account was April 2005. 
At the hearing, Applicant indicated that this debt remained unpaid.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – student loan that was 120-days or more past-due in the amount of 
$262. The date of first delinquency/date of last activity on this account was March 2011. 
At the hearing, Applicant stated that this debt is no longer delinquent. However, he 
provided no documentation to establish that this debt is current.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $1,609. This debt was a credit card with a low 
credit limit that Applicant opened to rebuild his credit rating. He testified that his debt 
remained unpaid.9 
                                                          
3 Tr. 24-25, 34-35, 65-74; GE 2, 3. In GE 3, Applicant indicated that he was unemployed for 14 
months. At the hearing, however, he stated that he was unemployed from about August 2010 to February 
2011 and had a temporary job from February 2011 to April 2011.

SOR ¶ 1.g – collection account for $1,017. This debt was a credit card account 
with a low credit limit that Applicant opened to help rebuild his credit rating. He testified 
that he has arranged a settlement agreement for this account, but that the debt is still 
outstanding.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h – collection account for $85. This debt was a utility account. The date 
of last activity on this account was August 2008. Applicant testified that this debt was 
paid in October or November 2011, but provided no proof of payment.11 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i  and SOR ¶ 1.j – collection accounts for $335 and $635, respectively. 
These debts were payday loans that Applicant obtained in November 2005. The date of 
last activity on these accounts was April 2007. A collection agency is handling both 
accounts. Applicant believed there was a settlement agreement for these accounts, but 
indicated that he has not made any payments.12 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k – collection account for $96. This debt was a utility account. The date 
of last activity on this account was August 2008. Applicant testified that he paid this 
account in October or November 2011. However, he provided no documentation 
establishing that it has been paid.13 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l – child support arrearages that were 120-days or more past due in the 
amount of $10,924. These child support arrearages are for his youngest daughter. She 
resides in another state with her mother. He testified that he is currently making monthly 
child support payments of $539 and that $75 of that amount goes towards paying the 
arrearages. He estimated that the current balance of the arrearages is between $9,000 
and $10,000. He also testified that he owed about $7,000 in child support arrearages for 
his oldest daughter and is making monthly payments of $700 towards those arrearages. 
The child support arrearages for his oldest daughter are not alleged in the SOR. His 
oldest daughter currently lives with him, and he no longer pays monthly child support 
payments for her. He provided no documentation showing payments towards this 
alleged debt.14 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m – collection account for $1,477. This debt was for a rental car. The 
date of last activity on his account was November 2009. Applicant testified that it 
remained unpaid.15

SOR ¶ 1.n – collection account for $1,265. This debt was a bank account that 
was placed for collection in December 2009. Applicant has received a settlement offer 
for this account, but did not recall whether he had accepted it. He noted this account 
remained unresolved.16 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o – collection account for $237. This debt was a utility account. 
Applicant testified that it remained unpaid.17 
 
In September 2011, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement that 
reflected his net monthly income was $7,836, that his total monthly expenses were 
$3,925, and that his monthly debt payments were $1,160, which left him a net monthly 
remainder of $2,751. At the hearing, he stated that he had about $500 or $600 in 
savings accounts and $400 in a checking account. He also testified that he had not yet 
filed his 2011 federal income tax return. He indicated that he received financial 
counseling in the past, but that was seven to ten years ago.18 
 
Applicant indicated that he was awarded two Army Commendation Medals while 
serving in the Army. He provided no work performance appraisals or letters of 
reference.19  
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
                                                          
16 Tr. 40-41, 55; GE 3, 4.  
17 Tr. 55, 60; GE 3.  
18 Tr. 55, 62-63, 66-67, 72-73; GE 3. 
19 Tr. 23-24.

adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
7 
 
 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts totaling over $21,000 that he has been 
unable or unwilling to satisfy for a number of years. This evidence is sufficient to raise 
the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Four financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts are ongoing, significant, and cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. In 
2004, he was divorced and saddled with debts, including a large IRS debt. He was 
unemployed for about seven or eight months between August 2010 and February 2011. 
His divorce and unemployment were conditions beyond his control. To obtain full credit 
under AG ¶ 20(b), however, an applicant must show that he or she acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. In this case, Applicant acknowledged that he has not lived up 
to his financial obligations and has not handled his finances properly. Many of the 
alleged debts are quite old and little or no action has been taken to resolve them. He 
has not presented any documentation showing that he has made any payments towards 
 
8 
 
 
the delinquent debts. In short, he has failed to show that these debts are being resolved 
or are under control. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant served honorably in the military from 1986 to 1995. He testified 
honestly at the hearing. He appears to be a hardworking, law-abiding citizen. 
Nevertheless, he has failed to show that he has taken any meaningful steps towards 
resolving his delinquent debts. His financial situation remains unstable. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.o:   Against Applicant

Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
