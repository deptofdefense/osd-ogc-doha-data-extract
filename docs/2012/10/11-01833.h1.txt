Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems related to marital troubles, which is a circumstance largely
beyond his control, and it is a circumstance unlikely to recur given his recent divorce.
He has made a good-faith effort to resolve some of the financial problems, and he has a
reasonable plan to resolve others. Applicant presented sufficient evidence to mitigate
the security concerns stemming from his problematic financial history. Accordingly, this
case is decided for Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about April1
18, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the
security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took
place September 20, 2012. The transcript (Tr.) was received September 28, 2012.
The hearing record was kept open until October 24, 2012, to allow Applicant to
submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely received and are
admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit 2.   
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged the following adverse financial matters: (1) an unpaid state tax
lien for $1,651; (2) four collection or charged-off accounts for a total of about $6,656; (3)
first and second mortgage loans in foreclosure; and (4) failure to file state and federal
income tax returns for 2009, 2010, and 2011. His answer to the SOR was mixed with
admissions and denials, and included documentary information, all of which is
considered to be part of his answer. His admissions are accepted and adopted and
incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported
by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 43-year-old field supervisor who is a part-time employee of a
company engaged in defense contracting. He has had this job since August 2009. He is
seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him. In addition to his part-
time job, he has a full-time job as a firefighter with a county fire department. He has held
this job since March 2008. According to his federal income tax returns, his adjusted
gross income was $63,416 for 2009, $75,758 for 2010, and $78,094 for 2011.  He may2
receive a promotion and pay raise in his firefighter job, although that matter is pending
and it may or may not occur.3

Applicant’s employment history also includes service in the U.S. military during
1988–2008. He served nearly six years as a firefighter followed by about 14 years as an
aircraft loadmaster in the U.S. Air Force. His discharge certificate reflects a decorated
career as a noncommissioned officer and an honorable discharge after 20 years of
service.  4
Applicant married in 1992, and the couple have three sons born of the marriage.
They separated in early 2009, and they divorced in June 2012.  The three minor sons5
lived with their mother during the separation, and the two youngest sons continue to do
so. The oldest son, who is no longer a minor, has recently begun service in the U.S.
military. His wife was employed outside the home during the marriage working full-time
and part-time jobs until about June 2009, a few months after the separation, when she
lost her full-time job.6
After separating in early 2009, Applicant and his wife attempted, without success,
to go through the divorce process without the assistance of counsel. His wife hired an
attorney in 2010, and she filed the petition for divorce shortly thereafter in August 2010.
A few months later in November 2010, the court issued an order requiring Applicant to
pay interim support for his family in the amount of $1,107 every two weeks. He paid that
amount until the divorce was granted. Applicant and his wife attempted to resolve their
differences through mediation in January 2011, but it was not successful. After some
delay, the court heard the divorce case in April 2012, and issued a final decree of
divorce in June 2012. Of relevance here, the court ordered the following:
• Applicant and his now ex-wife were awarded joint legal custody of their two minor
sons, whose primary place of residence is with their mother.
• Applicant was ordered to pay child support of $929 monthly beginning May 1,
2012, and then decreasing to $636 monthly beginning June 1, 2013.
• Applicant was ordered to pay transitional spousal support of $500 monthly for 60
consecutive months.
• Applicant and his ex-wife were ordered to file joint federal and state income tax
returns for 2009, 2010, and 2011. Noting that his ex-wife had already filed
separate returns for those years, the court ordered that she amend the returns to
the status of married filing jointly.

Applicant estimates he incurred about $3,000 in legal expenses for the divorce, all of
which he has paid.  7
Turning to the SOR allegations, Applicant has a history of financial problems,
which he does not dispute. He fell behind on his financial obligations during the marital
separation of 2009–2012, when he was providing financial support for his family and
establishing a separate household. His problematic financial history is confirmed by the
documentary information, which includes credit reports from 2010 and 2011.8
The first item in the SOR concerns the unpaid state tax lien for $1,651 (SOR ¶
1.a). After looking into this matter, Applicant learned that the tax lien was filed in 2009,
and it resulted from unpaid sales and use tax on an automobile purchase in a state of
former residence.  He  resolved it to the satisfaction of the state through a series of9
payments in 2011 and 2012, and it is considered paid in full as of June 2012.   10
The second item concerns four collection or charged-off accounts for a total of
about $6,656 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.i). Applicant presented documentary proof of
settlement in full as of August 2012 for a $1,344 charged-off account (SOR ¶ 1.c).  He11
also presented documentary proof of a repayment agreement as of June 2012, and
three subsequent monthly payments made under that agreement, for a $2,544 charged-
off account (SOR ¶ 1.i).  The other two accounts remain unresolved, but he intends to12
resolve them in the future.13
The third item concerns first and second mortgage loans in foreclosure (SOR ¶¶
1.d and 1.f). As alleged, the first mortgage loan was past due in the amount of $7,364
and had a balance of $50,269, and the second was charged off in the amount of
$6,917. In the divorce decree, the court found that the property was in foreclosure or
foreclosure had been completed, and Applicant and his ex-wife were equally entitled to
any net proceeds and equally responsible for any liability from this property.  14
Applicant and his wife bought the property in about 1994 and lived there until
about 2000, when they departed for his next military assignment. They elected to rent

the property instead of sell it, and they did so for several years. The monthly rental
payment was sufficient to pay the first mortgage loan, and they paid the second out-of-
pocket.  
Accordingly to Applicant’s longtime property manager, the neighborhood declined
during the five-year period of 2003–2008, when she managed the property.  Applicant15
owed more on the house than the market value when she stopped managing the
property. She stopped after concluding she could not secure responsible tenants that
would take care of the property due to deterioration of the neighborhood. She
suggested to Applicant in 2008 that he allow the property to go into foreclosure,
although he continued to make payments and rent the property post-2008. She
described Applicant as a responsible landlord who was responsive to tenant needs, he
kept the property in good repair, and he made his mortgage payments on time. Like his
other financial problems, Applicant was unable to maintain his monthly mortgage loan
payments due to the extra financial strain caused by his marital troubles during
2009–2012. He is currently unaware of any net proceeds or liability from the
foreclosure. 
The fourth item concerns the unfiled state and federal income tax returns for
2009, 2010, and 2011 (SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h). Like most married couples, Applicant and
his wife filed their income tax returns under the filing status of married filing jointly.
Following his divorce attorney’s advice, Applicant delayed filing returns during the
separation until the issue was resolved in the divorce proceedings. In the meantime, his
wife filed returns under the status of married filing separately. As head of household,
she claimed the minor children and thereby created an additional tax liability for
Applicant. In early August 2012, Applicant, through counsel, moved the court for an
order to show cause based on his ex-wife’s noncompliance with the court’s order to file
joint tax returns.  The court scheduled the show-cause hearing for October 23, 2012,16
and Applicant’s ex-wife failed to appear.  The court ruled that the ex-wife may be in17
violation of the court order, directed her to cooperate with filing amended returns within
30 days, scheduled another hearing for November 29, 2012, and directed both
Applicant and his ex-wife to be present. The court reserved the right to impose
sanctions. 
Also in early August 2012, Applicant elected to file the 2009–2011 returns with
the filing status of married filing separately.  He did so mainly to address the concerns18
in the SOR. His plan is to wait for the court to require his ex-wife to file amended
returns, which will reduce the tax liability he is now facing. If that is unsuccessful, he
intends to seek to modify the divorce decree by eliminating the requirement for
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to19
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to ath
security clearance).

transitional spousal support of $500 monthly for 60 consecutive months. He expects
that would result in sufficient cash flow to pay the taxes owed via repayment plans with
federal and state tax authorities. 
Applicant made a straightforward and well-organized presentation at the hearing.
He did not quibble with his financial history and he did not attempt to shirk responsibility
for the debts. Based on my opportunity to listen to his testimony and observe his
demeanor, I found Applicant’s hearing testimony to be credible and worthy of belief.
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As19
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt20
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An21
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  22
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting23
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An24
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate25
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme26

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation

Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.27
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.28
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it29
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant30
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline31
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  32

clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally

Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. His unfavorable financial history indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The33 34
facts are more than sufficient to establish these disqualifying conditions. In addition, he
failed to file state and federal income tax returns for the years 2009–2011.  35
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;36
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
 ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 37
9
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have considered all the mitigating conditions, and the most pertinent here are
AG ¶¶ 20(a), (b), (c), and (d). Applicant’s financial troubles are largely due to marital
troubles, which began in about 2009, when he and his wife separated. It costs more to
maintain two households, and Applicant was also providing financial support, informally
and under the interim support order, until the divorce was final, which occurred a few
months ago. And he is now paying child support and transitional spousal support. The
divorce decree did not resolve everything, however, as his ex-wife has not cooperated
with filing amended returns for the years 2009–2011. Her recalcitrance resulted in a
recent show-cause hearing, which the court will review within the next 30 days. 
Concerning the matters in the SOR, Applicant resolved the unpaid state tax lien,
settled one delinquent debt, entered into a repayment agreement for another delinquent
debt, and filed the state and federal income tax returns. He has a plan in place to
address the two unresolved delinquent debts. For the mortgage loans, the property is in
foreclosure or foreclosure has been completed, as noted by the divorce court. Applicant
is currently unaware of any net proceeds or liability from the foreclosure. 
Based on the record as a whole, I conclude as follows: (1) Applicant’s financial
problems happened under circumstances that are unlikely to recur; (2) his financial
problems resulted from his marital problems, which is a circumstance largely beyond his
control; (3) there are now clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved
and are under control; and (4) he has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his financial
problems. In other words, he is conducting himself as a responsible person, he is  doing
the best he can under difficult circumstances, and the trend line is favorable. 
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather,37
the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases,
the Appeal Board has established the following commonsense standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an application is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an application demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 38
 See Applicant Exhibits 1 and 2. 39
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).40
10
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.38
Here, the evidence shows Applicant has established a documented track record of
remedial actions sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under the Appeal Board’s
standard.   39
Under Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I have no doubts or concerns
about Applicant’s fitness or suitability for a security clearance. In reaching this
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the
whole-person concept.  In particular, I gave substantial weight to Applicant’s 20 years40
of honorable military service, which reflects highly on his  judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. Having done so, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.i: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
