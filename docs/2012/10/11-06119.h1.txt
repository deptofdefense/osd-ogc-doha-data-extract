GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 26, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a Security 
Clearance Application (e-QIP).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on April 9, 2012.2 On May 9, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December

29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (financial considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated July 5, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On August 9, 2012, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on August 9, 2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 5, 2012, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 24, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and one 
Applicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 2, 2012. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, and he 
submitted 32 additional exhibits (AE B through AE AG) that were admitted into evidence 
without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.c. of the SOR). Those admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining allegation (¶ 1.b.). 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since June 
2007, has been promoted to various positions as his original employers were acquired 
by his current employer. He now serves as a network administrator. He also held a 
variety of positions with previous employers, where he was a desktop administrator, an 
e-mail migration technician, a field technician, and a custom protection officer (security 
guard). He was also unemployed from June 2005 until March 2006, while he attended 
school full-time.3 He served on active duty as an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy 
Reserve from April 1994 until May 1998, when he was temporarily retired due to a 
disability and issued an honorable discharge certificate.4 During his military service, he 
was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary 
Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, the NATO Medal, and the Good Conduct 
Medal.5 Because of his service-connected disability, he currently receives a monthly

Applicant was also issued an honorable discharge certificate, dated December 18, 2003 (AE F), but there has been 
no explanation regarding military service during the period between 1998 and 2003. The disability has been 
described as a congenital knee condition and asthma. Tr. at 52-54.

award of $864.6 He initially received a security clearance in 19957 and currently holds a 
secret security clearance.8  
 
Applicant obtained an associate’s degree in an unspecified discipline in 
December 2000; a bachelor’s degree in an unspecified discipline in August 2006; and a 
master’s degree in business administration in August 2008.9 He was married on three 
occasions: the first time in 1994 and divorced in 2001; the second time in 2002 and 
divorced in 2003; and the third time in 2004. He and his wife have a son (born in 2009), 
and he has a daughter from an earlier relationship (born in 1998).10  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Although there were previously isolated instances in the past when Applicant was 
evicted from his apartment for nonpayment of rent in 2001 (when his disability checks 
failed to arrive on time); his automobile was repossessed in 2002; and some accounts 
became delinquent,11 his real financial problems started in about 2006 when he 
purchased a residence with the belief he “would be able to handle the payments.”12 
Applicant attributed his first financial difficulties to “changes in our family dynamics,”13 
but failed to explain what he meant by that term. He commented about the perils of his 
adjustable rate mortgage on his residence, high interest rates, mildew and mold issues 
with his residence, unforeseen medical issues, mounting medical bills, and the loss of 
his wife’s income associated with her maternity leave, as contributing factors to his 
financial difficulties.14 He added: “Although we both have decent jobs and income, we 
continue to be over extended through life, health, and homeownership circumstances.”15  
 
Applicant’s gross annual salary is $69,049,16 and his wife’s gross annual salary is 
about $44,000 or $45,000.17 In March 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial

statement that reflected the monthly combined net income for himself and his wife as 
$6,816.55.18 He claimed $6,090 in monthly expenses and $720 in debt payments, 
leaving a monthly net remainder of $6.55 available for discretionary spending or 
saving.19 Applicant never received financial counseling.20 
 
 The SOR identified three purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $53,280. Each account is described below, reflecting both the original 
and present status, as follows: 
 
(SOR & 1.a.): This is an educational loan with a nationally recognized career 
training school, specializing in skills and certification training for various careers, 
including information technology. In 1997, Applicant enrolled for a particular course. The 
high credit was listed in his 2011 credit report as $7,035.21 Because he was either late 
in making a payment, or he was late in completing the course, he called the school 
director and requested a 10-day extension. The extension was granted. However, on 
the second of the ten days, the school restricted his access to the school resources for 
the course.22 After Applicant made his payment, access was still denied.23 Applicant’s 
position was that if they refused to permit him to complete the course, he questioned 
why he should pay the remaining balance.24 The entire account was placed for 
collection with a past due balance of $9,380, including interest and late fees.25 Applicant 
did not press the issue at that time, focusing instead on another major issue with his 
mortgage holder.26 Compounding his problems over this account is the fact that the 
training campus in the state closed.27 Applicant’s wife eventually called the school 
headquarters in another state and was furnished two names of individuals who were 
supposedly handling the financial matters related to the school closure. Neither of the 
named individuals could be reached.28 Applicant’s wife also contacted the collection 
agent and requested validation of the debt, but she was advised that it would take up to

three weeks to do so.29 That period has passed without validation. The account does 
not appear in Applicant’s 2012 credit report.30 It remains unclear if the account has been 
resolved by the statute of limitations or some other reason. 
 
(SOR & 1.b.): This is loan for a time-share, vacation rental property, which 
Applicant purchased in 2004 for $25,900.31 The terms of the loan called for 120 monthly 
payments of $382.93, and as of September 2012, Applicant had made 97 such 
payments and had 23 payments remaining.32 The payoff amount on the loan, as of 
September 2012, was $8,915.26.33 Applicant’s 2012 credit report reflects the account as 
$900 past due,34 but the loan holder acknowledged Applicant is “current on [his] monthly 
payments and [is] scheduled to make [his] next payment by auto draft on September 28, 
2012.”35 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR & 1.c.): This is a $170,000 home adjustable rate mortgage loan that 
Applicant obtained in March 2006 when he purchased his residence for approximately 
$195,000.36 He paid $20,000 towards the purchase price. Because of financial 
difficulties, Applicant applied for, and received a loan modification with a reduced 
interest payment for one year. At the end of the year, the interest payments resumed. 
While most of the payments were made, additional issues caused him to make several 
late payments.  
 
In May 2009, he applied for another loan modification and was granted a trial 
period which was more affordable to him. In March 2010, after making reduced timely 
payments for eight or nine months, Applicant was informed that the mortgage lender 
had denied the loan modification. The payment of the full monthly payment of $1,500 
would not have been a problem for Applicant, but a payment to the mortgage lender of 
$10,000 was required within one month, and that was a condition that Applicant was 
unable to afford.37 Additionally, construction defects and continuing maintenance issues 
arose requiring costly renovations to the residence, so Applicant put the residence on 
the market for sale in October 2009. He voluntarily vacated the residence in August

2010,38 when a complaint seeking foreclosure was filed against Applicant.39 At the time, 
Applicant had a “preliminarily approved” “pre-foreclosure” pending contract for sale.40  
 
In October 2010, although the residence was still legally owned by Applicant, the 
mortgage lender took over and “secured” and “winterized” the property.41 Shortly 
thereafter, Applicant determined that the mortgage lender had trashed the property by 
ripping up and removing all the carpeting, and cutting all the pipes and plumbing.42 
When the buyer saw the condition of the residence, he withdrew from the sale,43 and 
the house went back on the market. Applicant noted that the mortgage lender had 
rendered the home as unlivable.44 Applicant continues to receive code violations on the 
property, and has spent in excess of $400 to secure the property, including damage to 
the fence caused by the mortgage lender when it covered the swimming pool.45  
When Applicant purchased the residence in 2006, it was appraised at almost 
$200,000. When he vacated the residence in 2010, the appraisal value was between 
$135,000 and $145,000. The property is now worth about $30,000 to $40,000.46 The 
property has continued to be for sale, and Applicant’s realtor recommended a sales 
price of $40,100.47 In October 2010, the mortgage lender approved a sale price of 
$44,400.48 In February 2011, Applicant received an offer of $22,000,49 but despite 
numerous exchanges of correspondence between Applicant and the mortgage lender, 
no action was taken by the mortgage lender until August 11, 2011, when a counter offer 
of $60,000 was made.50 Because of the damage to the property, the would-be

allowing the bank to bring the action; failing to verify the complaint; failure to allege an owner and holder of the 
mortgage and note; and failure to attach a valid assignment of mortgage.

purchaser disputed the comparative prices used to support the counter, and on 
September 8, 2011, the counter was reduced to $45,000.51 Negotiations ceased, and 
the contract fell through on November 8, 2011.52  
Applicant sought guidance from the mortgage lender to avoid foreclosure through 
the government Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program, but in January 
2012, the mortgage lender apologized for failing to respond to that request.53 In 
February 2012, Applicant again furnished the mortgage lender a request for a short 
sale.54 In April 2012, the mortgage lender issued a counter offer of $38,000, which was 
refused by the would-be purchaser.55  
In June 2012, the mortgage lender declined Applicant’s “deed-in-lieu” application 
to voluntarily transfer the ownership of the property to the mortgage lender in exchange 
for a release from the mortgage loan and payments.56 The mortgage lender explained 
that a property valued less than $50,000 does not qualify for the program.57 In August 
2012, Applicant requested a U.S. Government-sponsored independent foreclosure 
review to determine if he suffered financial injury as a result of errors or other problems 
during the foreclosure process.58 The review decision has not yet been issued. In 
September 2012, Applicant engaged the services of an attorney to negotiate a 
successful short sale of the property and mitigate any losses.59 The account is in the 
process of being resolved.

Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Various program managers and work colleagues have praised Applicant’s 
accomplishments and have characterized him in highly favorable terms. He was the first 
and only employee to hold all five valid CCNA certifications, covering a broad range 
spectrum of technology, simultaneously;60and only one of three out of 75 candidates 
selected to take advanced technology training.61 Applicant excels with strong initiative, 
meeting his commitments, wide ranging technical strengths, and keeping his credentials 
current.62 He is always dependable and responsible, a team player, and is “definitely” a 
man of trust.63 Applicant continues to “impress with [his] knowledge, attitude and work 
ethic.”64 In the past three years, Applicant has received three special payment awards in 
recognition of exemplary performance or achievement.65 His pastor characterized him 
as loyal, faithful, respectful, and dependable.66 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”67 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”68   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”69 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.70  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”71 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”72 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Aside from some isolated instances during the period between 1997 
(when his education loan was apparently defaulted) and 2002 (when his vehicle was 
repossessed), Applicant’s financial problems commenced in about 2006 when some 
issues occurred causing him to seek a loan modification of his home loan. He was able 
to remedy his financial problems until March 2010 when he was informed that his 
request for another loan modification had been denied. With a demand for $10,000 from 
the mortgage lender, Applicant’s mortgage loan became delinquent and went to a pre-
foreclosure status. He also allowed two other accounts to become delinquent. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ When 
“the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” AG ¶ 20(c) may 
apply. Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@73 Also, when 
                                                          
73
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
“the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt 
which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the 
basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” AG ¶ 20(e) 
may apply. 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in about 
2006 when some issues occurred causing him to seek a loan modification of his home 
loan. He remedied those financial problems until March 2010 when he was informed 
that his request for another loan modification had been denied. Because he was unable 
to comply with the mortgage lender’s demand for $10,000, Applicant’s mortgage loan 
became delinquent and went to a pre-foreclosure status. Applicant put the residence on 
the market for sale in October 2009. He voluntarily vacated the residence in August 
2010, when a complaint seeking foreclosure was filed against him, and he had a 
“preliminarily approved” “pre-foreclosure” pending contract for sale. When Applicant 
purchased the residence in 2006, it was appraised at almost $200,000. When he 
vacated the residence in 2010, the appraisal value was between $135,000 and 
$145,000. It is now worth about $30,000 to $40,000. The property has continued to be 
for sale, and the mortgage lender has entertained various offers for short sales, but 
decisions by the mortgage lender took significant delays, and its apparent reluctance to 
accept reasonable offers resulted repeatedly in several failed contracts.  
Another problem encountered by Applicant was the actions taken by the 
mortgage lender when it took over and “secured” and “winterized” the property. The 
property was trashed when the mortgage lender ripped up and removed all the 
carpeting, and cut all the pipes and plumbing. Would-be purchasers saw the condition 
of the residence and either lowered or withdrew their offers. Although the house 
remained on the market, it was essentially unlivable. Other would-be purchasers made 
offers, but the mortgage lender either took no responsible action for months at a time or 
made inconsistent counters, sometimes increasing the amount from previous counters. 
Applicant sought guidance from the mortgage lender to avoid foreclosure through 
the government Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program (HAFAP), but the 
mortgage lender failed to respond to that request. In June 2012, the mortgage lender 
declined Applicant’s “deed-in-lieu” application. Finally, in August 2012, Applicant 
requested an independent foreclosure review to determine if he suffered financial injury 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

as a result of errors or other problems during the foreclosure process. In September 
2012, Applicant engaged the services of an attorney to negotiate a successful short sale 
of the property and mitigate any losses.  
Applicant’s financial problems can be partially attributed to the perils of his 
adjustable rate mortgage on his residence, high interest rates, mildew and mold issues 
with his residence, unforeseen medical issues, mounting medical bills, the loss of his 
wife’s income associated with her maternity leave, and the devastation to the national 
economy and the housing market. No-one could have foreseen the value of the 
residence plunge from nearly $200,000 to $30,000.  
His financial problems were exacerbated by the actions of the mortgage lender in 
a number of ways, for it: accepted Applicant into a trial period for a loan modification, 
but, eight months later, determined Applicant did not qualify for the loan modification 
without explaining the reasons, and demanded an immediate payment of $10,000; 
acted irresponsibly in failing to timely respond to Applicant’s request under HAFAP; 
failed to respond to purchase offers within a reasonable time, thereby dissuading 
possible sales; countered to purchase offers inconsistently, sometimes increasing 
current counters from previous counters; trashed Applicant’s residence, thereby 
dramatically reducing the value of the property; and failed to comply with state law by 
improperly entering into bundling arrangements with other mortgage lenders and 
servicers in suing Applicant for foreclosure. Applicant’s mortgage lender was one of 
those fourteen mortgage servicers who were identified as having caused such 
significant damage to other borrowers that the independent foreclosure review process 
was established. While the mortgage lender’s history pertaining to other borrowers is 
not conclusive as to Applicant, it is of substantial relevancy. Applicant’s financial 
problems occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Furthermore, he 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.74  
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. While there is no evidence that Applicant has ever   
received counseling for his financial problems, other than guidance from his realtor and 
attorney, there are clear indications that those financial problems are being resolved or 
are under control. Applicant resolved one account and has attempted to resolve another 
one for which there is a legitimate dispute. However, while he has not yet resolved the 
issues regarding his mortgage, it is apparent that he has made continuing efforts to do 
so. Those efforts are supported by considerable documentation reflecting his actions as 
well as the actions of the mortgage lender.75

 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
13 
                                      
 
  
AG ¶ 20(e) only partially applies. Applicant may have a reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of the past-due educational loan debt. The creditor ceased 
operations in the state and Applicant has been unable to contact responsible parties 
associated with the organization. Although his wife contacted the collection agent and 
requested validation of the debt (which is no longer listed on his 2012 credit report), no 
such validation has been received. Unfortunately, Applicant has failed to provide 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute, and has only provided oral 
explanations of his actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:76 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available,

reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
the family finances permitted three accounts to become delinquent. As a result, one 
account was past-due, one was placed for collection, and one went to pre-foreclosure.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. It 
might be argued that Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 1997 when he 
encountered a dispute with the training school, resulting in a delinquent education loan. 
However, his real financial problems commenced with his purchase of a residence in 
2006. He remedied those financial problems until March 2010 when he was informed 
that his request for a loan modification had been denied. He was unable to comply with 
the mortgage lender’s demand for $10,000, so the mortgage loan became delinquent 
and went to a pre-foreclosure status. Applicant put the residence on the market for sale, 
and watched its value plunge from almost $200,000 to about $30,000 to $40,000. This 
was due, in part, to the actions of his mortgage lender, and, in part, to the devastated 
economy and local housing market, He tried to avoid foreclosure through HAFAP and a 
“deed-in-lieu” application. Neither application was approved. He has attempted short 
sales, but the untimely responses of the mortgage lender discouraged would-be 
purchasers. Applicant is a military veteran, the holder of a security clearance, a good 
husband and father, and exceptional person, and an outstanding employee. 
 I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.77 Applicant has 
demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt reduction and elimination. He has 
resolved one of the three debts, and has attempted to resolve the other two. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
