GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 2, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on April 9, 2012.2 On May 4, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 14, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated June 14, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On July 12, 2012, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on August 9, 2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 5, 2012, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 25, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through 4) and two Applicant 
exhibits (AE A and B) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. 
The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 2, 2012. I kept the record open to enable 
Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, and he 
submitted seven additional exhibits (AE C through I) that were admitted into evidence 
without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all ten (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j.) of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since April 
1981, has been promoted to various positions, but now serves as a senior manager, 
production operations.3 He has never served in the U.S. military.4 He has held a secret 
security clearance since 1988.5 Applicant received a Bachelor of Science in Engineering 
in 1981, and a Master of Science in Engineering in 1984, and has, over a number of 
subsequent years, completed various graduate courses in the doctoral degree 
program.6

Applicant was married in August 1978, and he has four children (two sons, born 
in 1979 and 1986, and two daughters, born in 1976 and 1988).7 He coached children’s 
sports for 17 consecutive years, and has had at least one child in college for the past 18 
years.8 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2007. He had built a five-bedroom home several years earlier, and as the value of the 
residence increased over the ensuing years, he periodically refinanced the home and 
used some of the proceeds to finance his children’s college education.9 He had 
excellent credit ratings and kept all of his accounts current.10 His primary goal was 
getting his children through college.11 In mid-2007, with his youngest child in college, 
and seeing no need to maintain such a large residence, Applicant intended to 
“downsize” and put the residence on the market.12 However, his plans were thwarted by 
a combination of factors over which he had no control: (1) Applicant’s wife became 
afflicted with colon cancer, requiring both surgery and a lengthy recovery period, 
delaying any possible relocation; and (2) the national economy, and especially the local 
housing market, collapsed.13 Although most of his wife’s medical expenses were 
covered by health insurance, Applicant also had unspecified expenses associated with 
the high deductible, co-payments, and incidental medical expenses.14 In early 2008, he 
discovered that the value of the residence had fallen below the value of the mortgage, 
and it was now “under water.”15  
 
Because he did not want to sell his property at a loss, and hoping the economy 
and the local housing market would rebound and make a prompt, full recovery, 
Applicant managed to continue making the necessary monthly payments on his home

mortgages and his credit cards until about January 2011.16 His mortgage payments 
became “so burdensome” that he began using credit cards for his daily living expenses, 
but the credit card banks began raising their rates to about 29 percent.17 He withdrew 
$50,000 from his 401(k) retirement account to cover living expenses and to pay off the 
remaining education loans for his children, and incurred an $11,000 penalty. He was 
unable to withdraw the remainder penalty-free without resigning from his employment.18 
Unfortunately, he was unable to keep making his payments “based on [his] on-going 
living expenses,” and began making alternative living arrangements.19 Applicant moved 
into his mother-in-law’s residence, eliminating utility expenses and hoping to consolidate 
expenses.20 Nevertheless, accounts started to become delinquent, and were placed for 
collection or charged off.  
 
In February 2011, Applicant consulted with a financial counselor who furnished 
him no education on credit management, debt consolidation, or budgeting, but did 
recommend that Applicant seek resolution of his debts through bankruptcy.21 In 
addition, over the past year, Applicant consulted with five different attorneys, and all of 
them recommended the same course of action.22 In April 2012, Applicant indicated he 
intended to initiate bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 13 of the U.S. bankruptcy 
Code. In May 2012, he engaged the services of an attorney to represent him in the 
bankruptcy, and paid the attorney an initial installment of $800 towards the entire 
$3,000 fee.23 However, upon receiving the SOR, Applicant concluded he should wait 
before continuing with the Chapter 13 because of his possible loss of employment.24 At 
the time, Applicant did not qualify under the means test for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
because of his salary.25  
 
During the hearing, Applicant acknowledged the entire security clearance review 
issue, including the fear of losing his security clearance and his job, as well as seeking 
bankruptcy, is embarrassing, and stated he did not wish to take five years to resolve his 
financial situation under Chapter 13.26 He concluded it was better to “resign” from his

employment, file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to have all of his delinquent debts discharged, 
and collect his pension of $3,700 before taxes.27 He stated:28 
 
I have been destroyed and I have to just say that the pressure on me from 
creditors is - - it’s really coming from you. It’s coming from DOHA. The 
creditors are being nice to me. They understand the situation now. It’s 
DOHA that’s putting the pressure on. . . . I have a life that I have to try to 
keep together. The way it resolves my debt is it allows me in six months to 
file Chapter 7 rather than have five years of Chapter 13 and end up being 
60-something years old and not a penny to my name and no prospects for 
employment. 
 
Applicant‘s gross annual salary as of April 2012, was $152,000.29 In April 2012, 
he submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a net monthly income of $8,151.30 
He claimed $6,612 in monthly expenses, as well as zero debt payments.31 He had 
$1,539 left over each month for discretionary spending or savings. He had $2,000 in the 
bank and $175,000 in his 401(k) retirement account. Applicant is unsure as to where the 
$1,539 monthly remainder has gone since April 2012, except to state that he had some 
hospital bills and other miscellaneous expenses to address.32 He recently paid $3,072 
towards college classes, books, software, and parking for himself in order to improve his 
chances of obtaining another job in the event of a “very high probability” that he will lose 
his security clearance.33 He also paid his employer $991.36 to close out his business 
expense account.34 He did not wish to settle any of his delinquent debts because of the 
potential tax consequences he might face if he did so.35 He also commented that he 
was cautioned by his attorney not to pay other creditors because, under Chapter 13, he 
was not to show any preference to any of the lenders.36 Nevertheless, he defended his 
payment of hospital bills by declaring that he had to be able to continue receiving

service at the hospital when he needs it.37 Applicant contended he was able to maintain 
timely monthly payments for all of his current accounts.38 
 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $725,152. Two of the accounts are a first mortgage (SOR & 1.a.) with an 
unpaid balance of $550,000,39 and a second mortgage or home equity loan with the 
same lender (SOR & 1.b.), taken out to repair and paint the residence to make it more 
attractive for sale, with an unpaid balance of $73,822.40 The first mortgage went into a 
foreclosure status, and in April 2012, the mortgage lender offered to assist Applicant by 
discussing alternatives to a foreclosure sale.41 Two of the alternatives were a short sale 
and a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In August 2012, Applicant selected the short sale 
option and requested approval from the mortgage lender.42 It is unclear if the option has 
yet been approved. Applicant listed the residence as available for a short sale for 
$270,000 on September 18, 2012.43 It is unclear as to what efforts may have been 
taken with regard to the second mortgage.  
 
The eight remaining delinquent accounts, according to Applicant, were credit 
card accounts.44 Those accounts, in varying amounts from $539 (SOR & 1.e.), $3,198 
(SOR & 1.d.), $4,182 (SOR & 1.f.), $4,570 (SOR & 1.g.), $6,425 (SOR & 1.h.), $18,572 
(SOR & 1.i.), $24,224 (SOR & 1.c.), and $34,620 (SOR & 1.j.), were placed for 
collection and charged off.45 Applicant initially spoke with his creditors in 2007, but they 
refused to settle any of the accounts. Instead, with nonpayment, the interest rates 
increased and the accounts were closed by the creditors.46  It is unclear when Applicant 
next spoke with his creditors, but he contends they are now very helpful, agreeing to 
settle accounts for ten cents on the dollar, but Applicant claims he doesn’t have the ten 
cents.47 He has no documents to support any of those resolution discussions. Applicant 
admits he has done nothing to resolve any of these credit card debts,48 and intends to

take no action other than to seek discharge of the debts under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
There is no evidence that Applicant made any significant effort to resolve these 
accounts, and they remain unresolved. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”49 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”50   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.52  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”53 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”54 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in mid-2007, Applicant started experiencing some 
financial difficulties, and without charging everyday living expenses to his credit cards, 
would have been unable to make his monthly mortgage payments. Financial difficulties 
increased to the point where he was unable to make either his mortgage payments or 
his credit card payments, and in January 2011, he stopped making any payments. His 
accounts started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. His 
financial difficulties remain unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@55  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative 
recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since January 2011 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” While Applicant 
consulted with a financial counselor who recommended that Applicant seek resolution of 
his debts through bankruptcy, Applicant acknowledged that the financial counselor 
furnished him no education on credit management, debt consolidation, or budgeting. 
Other that initial discussions with his credit card creditors in 2007, and more recent 
discussions with his mortgage holder in 2012, there is no evidence to indicate that 
Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
                                                          
55
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

his debts. When he discovered that the value of the residence had fallen below the 
value of the mortgage, and it was now “under water,” he chose not to sell his property at 
a loss, and hoped the economy and the local housing market would rebound and make 
a prompt, full recovery. So he did essentially nothing.  
 
Applicant refused to address his delinquent accounts with whatever extra money 
he may have had each month. Instead, he made recent payments for his college 
classes, books, software, and parking, in order to prepare for the loss of his security 
clearance and to improve his chances of obtaining another job if he loses his security 
clearance. He did not wish to settle any of his delinquent debts because of the potential 
tax consequences he might face if he did so. Applicant’s previous statements regarding 
his future intent to resolve his debts, without corroborating documentary evidence, are 
entitled to little weight.56 His most recent comments that he did not wish to take five 
years to resolve his financial situation under Chapter 13, and his conclusion that it was 
better to “resign” from his employment, file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to have all of his 
delinquent debts discharged, and collect his pension of $3,700 before taxes, reflects a 
surrender rather than an effort. This latest declaration of future intention to resolve his 
debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, after so much time where no positive efforts were 
taken, does not qualify as a “good-faith” effort.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his wife 
becoming afflicted with colon cancer, requiring both surgery and a lengthy recovery 
period, delaying any possible relocation; and the national economy, and especially the 
collapse of local housing market. Although most of his wife’s medical expenses were 
covered by health insurance, Applicant contended he also had unspecified expenses 
associated with the high deductible, co-payments, and incidental medical expenses. 
While some of those reasons were largely beyond Applicant’s control, it is difficult to 
conclude that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances.57  
 
In light of his substantial period of continuing financial problems, it is unlikely that 
they will be resolved in the short term, and they are likely to continue. Accordingly, 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under financial considerations, and 
under the circumstances, his actions do cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.58

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.59       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: He has a 
lengthy history of outstanding employment with the same employer, and he is a caring 
father and husband. Applicant’s financial difficulties were caused, in part, because of his 
wife becoming afflicted with colon cancer, requiring both surgery and a lengthy recovery 
period, delaying any possible relocation; the depressed national economy; and 
especially the collapse of local housing market.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
When he discovered that the value of the residence had fallen below the value of the 
mortgage, and it was now “under water,” he chose not to sell his property at a loss, and 
hoped the economy and the local housing market would rebound and make a prompt, 
full recovery. So he did essentially nothing. Applicant refused to address his delinquent 
accounts with whatever extra money he may have had each month, and instead spent it 
on other desires. He did not wish to settle any of his delinquent debts because of the 
potential tax consequences he might face if he did so. Applicant considered filing a 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but changed his mind because he did not wish to take five 
years to resolve his financial situation under Chapter 13. Instead, he concluded that it 
was better to “resign” from his employment, and file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to have all 
of his delinquent debts discharged. But even that action has yet to be undertaken by 
him.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:60 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
In this instance, Applicant has offered little evidence of efforts, other than statements 
and promises, to resolve his delinquent debts. And now, even those statements and 
promises have been overcome by his new declaration of intent. Applicant’s “meaningful 
track record” is not a satisfactory one. He has discussed bankruptcy before, and still 
entertains that possibility. Applicant could have made some reasonable timely efforts to 
resolve his accounts, but he has not done so. Applicant’s actions indicate a lack of 
financial judgment, which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability 
to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
