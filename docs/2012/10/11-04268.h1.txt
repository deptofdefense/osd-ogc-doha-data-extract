GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations or personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 21, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on January 24, 2012.2 DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
him on March 7, 2012, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review

Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and 
detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 15, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated March 21, 2012, Applicant requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed on April 25, 2012, and the case was assigned to me on May 2, 2012. As 
Applicant was working in Afghanistan, a continuance was granted until he was 
scheduled to briefly return to the United States to obtain his records and documentation. 
A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 5, 2012, and I convened the hearing by 
video teleconference, as scheduled, on September 12, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, 14 Government exhibits (GE 1 through 14) and 1 Applicant 
exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one other 
witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 20, 2012. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity, and he submitted a total of 11 documents that were admitted into evidence, 
without objection, as exhibits (AE B-L). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five factual allegations (¶¶ 1.b. 
through 1.d., 1.g., and 1.h.) pertaining to financial considerations, as well as one factual 
allegation (¶ 2.b.) pertaining to personal conduct of the SOR. He denied the remaining 
allegations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since 
November 2010, has served as a foreman. He received a performance recognition 
award in 2011. He was previously employed in a variety of positions including diesel 
technician from May 1986 until October 2006; heavy-wheeled mechanic from March 
2007 until October 2008; maintenance foreman from March 2009 until October 2010; 
and mechanic from October 2010 until he was promoted to his present position. He 
spent approximately 1,200 days deployed to Iraq from March 2007 until October 2008, 
and from March 2009 until October 2010. Applicant was unemployed from October 
2006 until March 2007, and again from October 2008 until March 2009.3 He received 
unemployment compensation while he was unemployed.4

Applicant served on active duty as an enlisted member of the U.S. Marine Corps 
from August 1980 until August 1984, during which time he was awarded the Sea 
Service Deployment Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, a Certificate of Achievement, 
and a Letter of Appreciation.5 He received an honorable discharge certificate. Although 
he underwent pre-employment background checks in 2009, it is unclear if he was ever 
granted a security clearance. He believes he received an “interim” clearance of an 
unspecified level. 
 
Applicant was married in January 1980, and divorced in 1996. He was married 
again in December 2006. He has two step-children (his wife’s children from previous 
relationships). He is a June 1979 high school graduate.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant’s finances transitioned from current to delinquent, for 
other than his periods of unemployment (October 2006 until March 2007, and again 
from October 2008 until March 2009) and his description of his first wife’s actions 
related to a home mortgage, he has expressed only general reasons why accounts 
started to become delinquent in 2003, placed for collection, or charged off. Instead, 
Applicant simply explained that in 2004 and 2005, “times got tough. . . . I just got behind 
and once you get behind it’s hard to catch up.”6 With the exception of casual references 
to his wife’s illness (“My wife started getting sick around that time. She has liver disease 
and I think that might have been part of that too.”), and the loss of her salary, he denied 
that there were any family medical emergencies or unexpected household bills.7 
Applicant acknowledged that prior to joining his current employer in March 2009, he was 
living “paycheck to paycheck,” and “there was just not enough money” to pay his bills.8 
 
In November 2010, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). They discussed various accounts that were, 
according to a November 2010 credit report, described as delinquent, in collection, 
charged off, or in foreclosure. Among those accounts were six accounts that currently 
appear in the SOR. Applicant was unaware of some of the accounts, and could only

mostly covered by insurance, but some of the medications and other unspecified “stuff,” were only partially covered. 
Tr. at 55. Additionally, although he had no legal obligations regarding her expenses, as they were not yet married, 
they were residing together in the residence they jointly bought, and her salary was contributing to the household 
payments. The loss of her income (estimated at $28,000 to $30,000 per year) had an impact on his ability to remain 
current. During her short-term disability, she received about $600 per month. See, Tr. at 56-57.

speculate regarding the others. He added that one might be an old account that he was 
having computer problems reporting.9 He explained that his wife handles all finances, 
and as far as he knew, “their finances are fine and they are current on all household 
debts.”10 He stated that in six months when he was scheduled to return from 
deployment, he and his wife would sit down with a credit report and determine what is 
owed. 
 
In January 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement which 
reflected a net monthly income of $9,002; with monthly expenses, including mortgage, 
of $2,136; leaving a net remainder of $6,866. He also listed $60,000 in savings.11 
Applicant estimated his 2011 salary was $157,000; in 2010, it was $96,000; and in 
2009, $80,000 to $85,000.12 
 
The SOR identified eight purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $85,180. Each account is described below, reflecting both the original 
and present status, as follows: 
 
 (SOR & 1.a.): This is a bank credit card account (opened in 2005) with a 
high credit of $1,513 that was charged off in that amount.13 The unpaid 
balance was initially increased to $1,701,14 and as of April 2012, the 
unpaid balance was $1,758.15 Although Applicant had previously had one 
credit card from the creditor that became delinquent in 2004 or 2005, he 
was unaware of this particular account. His wife called the creditor several 
times, but the creditor purportedly had no record of the account.16 
Applicant offered no documentation to confirm his contentions. As of the 
hearing, the account had not been resolved. However, subsequent efforts 
by Applicant after the hearing resulted in the creditor agreeing to settle the 
account in full for a payment of $1,500, and a payment of that amount was 
made on September 19, 2012.17 The account has been resolved.

 (SOR & 1.b.): This is a telephone account with Verizon with a past due 
balance of $36 that was placed for collection.18 Applicant thought it might 
be an old telephone bill, but because he still maintained service with the 
same company, he believed it had been paid. Applicant offered no 
documentation to confirm his belief. He did not personally contact the 
creditor to determine the status of the account,19 and it is unclear if his 
wife ever did so. On April 23, 2012, the account was still listed as 
delinquent.20 As of the hearing, the account had not been resolved. 
However, subsequent efforts by Applicant after the hearing resulted in the 
creditor agreeing to accept $40.70 to satisfy the account in full, and a 
payment of that amount was made on September 19, 2012.21 The account 
has been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.c.): This is a utility and fuel account with a past due balance of 
$181 that was charged off.22 Applicant denied ever having an account with 
the creditor, and opined it might be an old gas bill. He believed it had been 
paid.23 Applicant offered no documentation to confirm his belief. He did not 
personally contact the creditor to determine the status of the account but 
believes his wife did so. The creditor purportedly had no record of the 
account.24 Applicant offered no documentation to confirm his contention. 
On April 23, 2012, the account was still listed as delinquent.25 As of the 
hearing, the account had not been resolved. However, subsequent efforts 
by Applicant after the hearing resulted in the creditor acknowledging that 
the unpaid balance was $181.71, but there is no contention or 
documentation indicating that a payment had been promised or actually 
made by Applicant.26 The account has not been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.d.): This is another bank credit card account (opened in 2002) 
with the same creditor as that referred to in SOR & 1.a. with a high credit

 AE D (Account Master File Inquiry, dated September 13, 2012). Interestingly, although not appearing in 
any other evidence, there is a reference to Applicant filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in May 1995, ten days after 
the final meter reading. The significance of the bankruptcy comment is unclear as neither the SOR nor the OPM 
investigation made any reference to such an action.

of $9,717 that was charged off in that amount.27 Applicant contended this 
was the only credit card from the creditor, and believed it became 
delinquent in 2004 or 2005. His wife called the creditor several times just 
before he “started making some decent money,” but the creditor 
purportedly had no record of the account.28 Furthermore, the account is no 
longer listed in Applicant’s 2011 or 2012 credit reports.  Applicant offered 
no documentation to confirm his contention. Subsequent efforts by 
Applicant after the hearing resulted in the creditor agreeing to accept 
$7,882.10 over time to satisfy the account in full. A payment schedule 
calling for five monthly payments of $250 plus a final balloon payment of 
$6,632.10 was offered on September 20, 2012.29 Applicant agreed to 
make six payments of $250 plus the final balloon payment, and the 
monthly payments are scheduled to be automatically taken from his wife’s 
bank account.30 Applicant offered no documentation to confirm the 
agreement or the initial payment. Nevertheless, it appears that the 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.e.): This is a bank vehicle loan with a high credit of $16,250 
(opened in 2003) and an unpaid balance of $9,947 that was charged off 
and sold to another bank as a collection agent.31 Applicant contends his 
truck was repossessed and subsequently sold, leaving no unpaid 
balance.32 Applicant’s wife never contacted the creditor.33 Applicant 
offered no documentation to confirm his contention. The last time he had 
any contact with the creditor was in about 2006 or 2007.34 The account 
with the collection bank is still listed in Applicant’s 2011 and 2012 credit 
reports, but the balance is listed as “zero.”35 Accordingly, while Applicant

 Tr. at 29-30, 65-68. There is documentary evidence that the same creditor filed a civil action complaint 
against Applicant in April 2008, seeking $9,663.38 plus fees, interest, and costs, but that service was returned 
unexecuted because Applicant was “in the US military serving in Iraq,” and the law prohibits service. The matter was 
discontinued without prejudice in January 2010. See GE 12 (Civil Action Complaint, dated April 27, 2008); GE 13 
(Court Record, dated February 21, 2012). Because the court record does not reflect an account number, it is difficult 
to determine if the accounts are the same.

has offered no proof that the account has been paid, the Government 
exhibits provide evidence that the account has been resolved.  
 
 (SOR & 1.f.): This is an educational loan for Applicant’s stepdaughter 
obtained through Sallie Mae with a high credit of $10,373, a past due 
balance of $12,609, and an unpaid balance of $19,364 that was charged 
off in September 2010.36 Applicant and his wife started receiving 
delinquency notices on the account as far back as 2004, but neither of 
them ever contacted the creditor to resolve the account. Instead, they 
accepted Applicant’s stepdaughter’s word that she was “taking care” of the 
account and that it was “under control.”37 The account is no longer listed in 
Applicant’s 2011 and 2012 credit reports. Applicant had offered no proof 
that the account had been paid or brought into a current status, and as of 
the hearing, the account had not been resolved. However, subsequent 
efforts by Applicant after the hearing resulted in the creditor determining 
that there is a zero balance, but Applicant is unable to furnish 
documentary confirmation of that fact.38 Nevertheless, I conclude that the 
account has been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.g.): This is default judgment entered against Applicant in July 
2011, in the amount of $1,728.72, as a result of an automobile accident 
involving Applicant’s wife and the plaintiff.39 The insurance did not cover 
all of the damages. Upon receiving the initial bills, Applicant’s wife failed to 
make any payments. Applicant acknowledged that at some point, he gave 
her the money to pay the bill, but she failed to pay it all at the time as she 
was “supposed to.”40 He contends he paid off the judgment by check,41 
but offered no documentation to confirm his contention. The account has 
not been resolved. 
 
 (SOR & 1.h.): This is a default judgment on a mortgage foreclosure 
entered against Applicant and his first wife in June 1996, in the amount of 
$42,505.46.42 He denied ever receiving notification in the mail about the 
judgment or foreclosure.43 Applicant contends that when he and his first 
wife separated, she was to remain in the residence and take responsibility

for continuing to make the mortgage payments. Instead, she failed to do 
so and vacated the residence.44 Applicant was aware that there was an 
unpaid balance on the mortgage,45 but Applicant’s current wife did not 
know the judgment existed.46 Since receiving the SOR, neither Applicant 
nor his current wife has made any effort to contact the creditor or to 
resolve the judgment.47 
 
There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling. 
 
Personal Conduct 
  
In May 2004, Applicant and his then-fiancée were involved in an altercation 
during which she threw things at him and she thought Applicant would become violent. 
She called the police, and when they arrived, Applicant was arrested, even though he 
had not touched her. He spent two days in the county jail before being released.48 
Applicant was charged with simple assault, terroristic threats with intent to terrorize 
another, and harassment – subject other to physical contact.49 Applicant contended the 
charges were dropped, and he was ordered to complete anger management classes, 
which he did.50 However, the local police chief indicated Applicant had been convicted 
in June 2004, on his plea of guilty, to summary harassment.51 The Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) Identification record confirmed Applicant’s contention, but it reported 
those charges were all nolle prossed or withdrawn and there was no conviction.52  
 
In August 2006, Applicant was purportedly charged with the same three 
charges.53 Those charges were supposed to have been withdrawn, and Applicant was 
allegedly ordered to attend domestic violence classes and drug and alcohol classes.54 
Applicant contended the two incidents were the same incident, but he did erroneously 
report it on his SF 86, stating the charges had been dropped. Other than the police

chief’s note, and Applicant’s SF 86 entry, there is nothing to support two different 
incidents reflecting identical charges and identical conclusions. 
 
In October 2006, Applicant failed a breathalyzer test that was administered at his 
workplace.55 As a result, Applicant was involuntarily dismissed from his employment.56 
Applicant subsequently furnished various versions of his departure. He told the OPM 
investigator that he left under a “mutual agreement” to work for another employer, and 
denied having been fired.57 On his SF 86, he acknowledged leaving a job “for reasons 
under unfavorable circumstances,” but indicated he left to work for another company.58 
In fact, he was unemployed over the next five months, collecting unemployment 
compensation, before joining the new employer in March 2007. During the hearing, the 
version shifted again. He acknowledged getting fired, but because he agreed not to fight 
the dismissal through the union, the employer “would just let [Applicant] collect while 
[he] switched jobs. . . . [S]o [Applicant] agreed to leave and not make a big stink about it 
so apparently they must have put [him] down as being fired.”59 He acknowledged that it 
was possible that he was too embarrassed to list his termination as a firing.60 
 
On October 21, 2010, Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86. The SOR 
alleges Applicant falsified material facts when he falsely stated that he had no debts 
delinquent over 90 days (' 26n) or delinquent over 180 days (' 26m). In fact, as noted 
above, he had a number of such delinquencies. Applicant denied having intentionally 
falsified his answers and acknowledged he had delinquent debts. He claimed that when 
he tried to enter the correct responses, the computer system would not accept his 
answers and explanations, so he gave up and simply said “no.”61 He acknowledged that 
he did not advise the OPM investigator of his difficulties in making the correct 
answers.62 Under the circumstances, I conclude that Applicant’s explanation is 
unreasonable, and that he intentionally falsified his answers to these two questions. 
 
The SOR also alleges Applicant falsified material facts when he omitted that he 
had been fired from his job when he acknowledged leaving a job “for reasons under 
unfavorable circumstances,” but indicated he left to work for another company (' 13C). 
Because of his shifting explanations, as discussed above, I conclude that Applicant’s 
explanation is unreasonable, and that he intentionally falsified his answer to this 
question because he was too embarrassed to list his termination as a firing.

The SOR also alleges Applicant falsified material facts regarding a 2004 
conviction for harassment when he omitted from his answer (' 22a) that he had “been 
issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against 
you; are you on trial or awaiting a trial on criminal charges; or are you currently awaiting 
sentencing for a criminal offense?” As noted above, Applicant contended the 2004 and 
2006 incidents were the same incident, and he did erroneously report the 2006 incident 
on his SF 86. The Government exhibits regarding the alleged harassment issue(s) are 
inconsistent, and there is little, if any, substantial evidence to support the existence of 
two different incidents reflecting identical charges and identical conclusions. 
Accordingly, while Applicant did report a harassment incident for 2006, and there are 
questions as to the accuracy of reports of a 2004 incident, I conclude his explanation is 
reasonable, and that he did not intentionally falsify his answer to this question. 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”63 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”64   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”65 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.66  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”67 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”68 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
                                                          
65
 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

th
 Cir. 1994).

12 
                                      
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 2003, or as Applicant 
explained, in 2004 and 2005, “times got tough. . . . I just got behind and once you get 
behind it’s hard to catch up.” Accounts became delinquent and were placed for 
collection or charged off. In addition, there were a repossession and two judgments. AG 
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Similarly, 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith effort 
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.69  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply, and AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies. While the 
behavior commenced long ago, it has continued to the present time. As noted above, 
Applicant went through two periods of unemployment (October 2006 until March 2007, 
and again from October 2008 until March 2009), during which he received 
unemployment compensation. His wife has had some health issues. However, he joined 
his current employer March 2009, and has been making a salary sufficient for him to 
                                                          
69
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

address his delinquent accounts. He claimed to be aware of those delinquencies in 
October 2010 when he completed his SF 86. Any lingering questions he may have had 
regarding his financial delinquencies were addressed during his OPM interview in 
November 2010. The interrogatories in January 2012 and the March 2012 SOR clearly 
identified his delinquent accounts. Yet, despite the wealth of information furnished to 
him, Applicant’s direct and indirect efforts failed to produce evidence of any solid 
account resolutions. Instead, he offered only verbal comments and explanations, 
unsupported by any documentary evidence. He claimed not to know some of the 
accounts, and claimed that several of the identified creditors had no knowledge of him 
or his accounts. It was not until after the hearing that he finally realized the significance 
of his delinquencies and he took any meaningful efforts to resolve them. Creditors who 
previously purportedly had no knowledge of his accounts suddenly acknowledged them 
and Applicant and his wife started to address them. Applicant’s inaction until September 
2012 casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies. While Applicant may have been confronted with 
circumstances beyond his control in about 2003 to 2005, when “times got tough,” as 
noted above, he acknowledged he made few recent efforts to contact his creditors. 
Commencing in March 2009, when he started making a good salary, he displayed little 
interest in resolving his delinquent accounts, and he submitted no documentation to 
support his contentions regarding the purported efforts he did make to resolve those 
delinquent accounts.70 Before the hearing, there supposedly were creditors who had no 
knowledge of his accounts. After the hearing, they suddenly acknowledged the 
accounts and Applicant and his wife finally initiated a good-faith effort to address them. 
During the relatively brief period that has passed since the hearing, Applicant has 
managed to resolve four of the accounts, and start the resolution process for one 
account. He claimed he had resolved one additional account, but offered no 
documentation to support his claim. It remains unclear what efforts or decisions have 
been made with respect to another account. No efforts have been made regarding the 
mortgage foreclosure. Because of the lengthy period of inaction before addressing his 
delinquent accounts, Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances.71  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
                                                          
70
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), security concerns may be raised when there is a: 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.”  
 
Similarly, “deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, 
or other official government representative,” is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 
16(b). Under AG ¶ 16(c), security concerns may be raised if there is: 
 
credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard 
protected information. 
If there is: 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of:  
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client 
confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of 
sensitive corporate or other government protected information; (2) 
disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a 
pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) evidence of significant misuse 
of Government or other employer's time or resources, 
security concerns may be raised under AG ¶ 16(d). Also, under AG ¶ 16(e), it is 
potentially disqualifying if there is: 
 
15 
                                      
 
 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing . . . . 
 
In May 2004, Applicant was arrested, and spent two days in the county jail before 
being released. He was charged with simple assault, terroristic threats with intent to 
terrorize another, and harassment – subject other to physical contact. Applicant 
contended the charges were dropped, and he was ordered to complete anger 
management classes, which he did. The records (Government exhibits) are inconsistent 
as to what occurred thereafter, for as noted, the local police chief indicated Applicant 
had been convicted in June 2004, on his plea of guilty, to summary harassment, but the 
FBI Identification record confirmed Applicant’s contention, and reported those charges 
were all nolle prossed or withdrawn and there was no conviction. In August 2006, 
Applicant was purportedly charged with the same three charges. Other than the police 
chief’s note, and Applicant’s SF 86 entry, there is nothing to support two different 
incidents reflecting identical charges and identical conclusions. 
 
In October 2006, Applicant failed a breathalyzer test that was administered at his 
workplace. As a result, he was involuntarily dismissed from his employment. 
 
On October 21, 2010, Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86. He falsely 
stated that he had no debts delinquent over 90 days or over 180 days, when in fact, he 
had a number of such delinquencies. Applicant denied having intentionally falsified his 
answers and acknowledged he had delinquent debts, but claimed that when he tried to 
enter the correct responses, the computer system would not accept his answers and 
explanations, so he gave up and simply said “no.” He did not advise the OPM 
investigator of his difficulties in making the correct answers.  
 
Applicant also falsified material facts when he omitted that he had been fired 
from his job when he acknowledged leaving a job “for reasons under unfavorable 
circumstances.” He indicated he left to work for another company. Because of his 
shifting explanations, as discussed above, I concluded that Applicant’s explanation is 
unreasonable, and that he intentionally falsified his answer to this question because he 
was too embarrassed to list his termination as a firing.  
 
The SOR also alleges Applicant falsified material facts regarding the 2004 
conviction for harassment when he omitted it from his answer regarding any criminal 
proceedings against him. As noted above, Applicant contended the 2004 and 2006 
incidents were the same incident, and he did erroneously report the 2006 incident on his 
SF 86. The Government exhibits regarding the alleged harassment issue(s) are 
inconsistent, and there is little, if any, substantial evidence to support the existence of 
two different incidents reflecting identical charges and identical conclusions. 
Accordingly, while Applicant did report a harassment incident for 2006, and there are 
questions as to the accuracy of reports of a 2004 incident, I concluded his explanation is 
reasonable, and that he did not intentionally falsify his answer to this question. 
 
16 
                                      
 
Accordingly, as to SOR ¶ 2.c., none of the disqualifying conditions apply. However, as 
to SOR ¶¶ 2.a. and 2.b., AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) have been established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(a) may apply if “the individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before 
being confronted with the facts.” Similarly, if “the offense is so minor, or so much time 
has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” AG ¶ 17(c) may apply.  
 
As to Applicant’s financial issues and his employment termination issue, his 
claims and shifting explanations are simply too unreasonable to accept as the truth. I 
can accept reasonable explanations, and even take administrative notice, regarding 
computer system problems, but Applicant’s subsequent actions simply belie those 
explanations. He did not advise the OPM investigator of his difficulties in making the 
correct financial answers, and gave various versions of the employment termination 
before accepting the ultimate conclusion that he was fired.72 AG ¶¶ 17(a) and 17(c) do 
not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
                                                          
72
 An intent to falsify can be shown by circumstantial evidence even in the face of denials of any intent to 
falsify.  ISCR Case No. 05-03554.a1 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2007), at 4. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-0770 at 3 (App. 
Bd. July 16, 1992); Cf. Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1995) (“Notwithstanding a person’s disclaimers, a 
contrary state of mind may be inferred from what he does and from a factual mosaic tending to show that he really 
meant to accomplish what he professes not to have intended.”). 
 
 
17 
                                      
 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.73       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He served 
honorably with the USMC, and with the exception of his 2006 termination from 
employment, he has generally been a good employee. He finally commenced efforts to 
resolve his long-standing delinquent debts. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s history includes a lengthy period of disregard for his financial delinquencies, 
which he only recently started to address; an issue of anger control stemming from his 
2004 altercation with his then-fiancée; and several instances of dishonesty in 2010. 
Over a period of years, he continued to give the impression that he was not fired and 
that he had no financial delinquencies when, in fact, those impressions were false. 
Applicant has offered explanations for his actions. However, as I have noted above, 
Applicant’s explanations were simply not credible. Under the evidence presented, I have 
significant questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
