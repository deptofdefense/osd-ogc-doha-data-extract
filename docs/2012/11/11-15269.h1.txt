GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
foreign preference. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 28, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a Security Clearance 
Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on May 4, 2012.2 On May 30, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (financial considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 19, 2012. In a sworn 
statement, dated June 27, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On August 3, 2012, pursuant to & 
E.3.1.13 of the Directive, DOHA issued him an amendment to the SOR. The SOR 
amendment added alleged security concerns under Guideline C (foreign preference). 
Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR amendment on August 14, 2012. On that 
same date, he responded to the SOR amendment. Department Counsel had indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on August 6, 2012. The case was assigned 
to me, along with the companion case of Applicant’s wife, on August 9, 2012. A Notice 
of Hearing was issued on September 5, 2012, and I convened the joint hearing, as 
scheduled, on September 26, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, ten Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 10) and four 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE D) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and his wife testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, 2012. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity, and he submitted a substantial number of additional exhibits (AE E 
through AE AK) that were admitted into evidence without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted 15 of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c. through 1.b., 1.g., 1.i., 1.m., 1.o. 
through 1.u., and 1.w. of the SOR).3 In his Answer to the SOR amendment, Applicant 
admitted both of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference (¶¶ 2.a. and 
2.b.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the 
remaining allegations. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 68-year-old chief executive officer (CEO) of a defense contractor 
that he established in the United States in 1993. He was born in the United Kingdom 
(UK) to British citizen-residents, and was raised and educated in the UK. He graduated 
from a British high school in May 1960 and received his first associate’s degree in 
business management in May 1977 in the UK. He received a second associate’s 
degree in an unspecified discipline from a college in the United States in January 2004.

 Department Counsel conceded that SOR && 1.l. and 1.m. were duplicates, and moved to strike & 1.l. 
There being no objection, the motion was granted. Tr. at 17-18.

He was married on two occasions: the first time in 1960 and divorced in 1980; 
and the second time in 1983. He and his first wife have a son, and he and his current 
wife have two sons (born in 1985 and 1987).4  
 
Applicant first arrived in the United States in 1993 in response to an invitation by 
a state economic development commission conducting an assessment of Applicant’s 
technology capabilities. He established the company in the United States and staffed it, 
but continued to operate both the U.S. entity and a UK entity, spending several weeks 
at a time at each location. In 1997, he relocated his family to the United States.5 He 
became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2001,6 and his wife became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen in May 2004.7 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant’s financial problems first started to develop. During 
the four-year period that he was commuting between the United States and the UK, he 
had an employee serving as the senior administrator who was looking after the 
company finances, running the business in Applicant’s absence, and producing monthly 
reports. Eventually, however, Applicant discovered that aside from being very nice and 
very clever, she had a propensity to steal. She had embezzled and fraudulently 
obtained monies and credit in the names of both the company and Applicant. She also 
obtained a false Social Security number. There were balances on credit cards that he 
was not aware of, forged signatures, and unpaid taxes. Applicant estimated his 
company lost substantially over $300,000. The employee was successfully prosecuted 
by the authorities. She was placed on house arrest, given 15 years’ probation, and 
required to pay restitution to the extent she could do so over the period of 15 years. The 
employee actually repaid only about $2,000.8 Because of those illegal activities, 
Applicant and his company were in substantial debt. Nevertheless, while he was legally 
absolved from any responsibility for those debts, he felt a moral obligation to do so, and 
he embarked on an effort to pay his creditors in full.9 Applicant got his business back on 
track in 1998-1999.10 
 
During a period of financial prosperity, both nationally and personally, Applicant 
invested in about ten rental properties. He paid cash for some of the properties and

obtained several small home mortgages for others.11 He also purchased a residence in 
about 2004 or 2005 for $2.4 million, and he obtained several lines of credit. The rents 
from the rental properties easily covered the mortgages. Applicant felt that some of the 
properties could be leveraged if he needed to generate additional income for research 
and development.12 
 
Several additional circumstances created Applicant’s present financial difficulties. 
In 2004 and 2005, there were expenses and development costs of certain technology 
that Applicant expected to play “a significant role” in a high profile national activity that 
has been hotly debated over the past four years. Because of his enthusiasm with his 
project, Applicant allowed his core business – product design – to drift as he put all of 
his focus on software.  
 
In 2008, because of the national economic downturn, major corporations across 
the nation that had been working with his company suddenly ceased substantial 
involvement in several areas of Applicant’s company’s core technology design services, 
and he lost over 50 percent of his anticipated revenue. Applicant was confident that he 
was close to a breakthrough, and had to make a choice of either shutting down his 
project and losing what he had already put into it, or continuing with his efforts. He 
needed more time and more money to accomplish his goals, so he chose the latter 
option, and to generate the necessary funds to do so, he started mortgaging his 
properties.13 Unfortunately, the bottom fell out of the housing market and his properties, 
now all with substantial mortgages, were all “under water.”14 Some renters bailed out of 
his properties. In 2009, without any forewarning, a major investor withdrew from further 
investment activity.15  
 
Finally, as a result of poor decisions by Applicant, various state payroll taxes 
were not properly withheld in locations where Applicant’s company had performed 
services. In 2009, accounts started to become delinquent. Liens were placed against 
him and some delinquent accounts were sent to collection or charged off. Despite 
mounting financial difficulties, Applicant and his wife maintained a good lifestyle: in 
August 2009, Applicant’s wife vacationed in the UK for ten days; in January 2011, he 
and his wife vacationed in Central America for five days; in April 2011, Applicant’s wife 
vacationed in the Caribbean for one week; and they both vacationed in the UK for an 
unspecified period in July 2012.16

Attorneys and friends advised him to declare bankruptcy, but he refused to 
consider such an option.17 Instead, he turned to a realtor and an accountant to seek 
professional guidance and assistance. In an effort to resolve his delinquent accounts, 
Applicant opened discussions with all of his creditors, intending to resolve some 
accounts and engage in resolution efforts on other accounts. He put his properties up 
for sale. Hoping to rely on his emergency backup plan – his mother-in-law’s reserve of 
$375,000 – Applicant could not do so for she had become the victim of a multi-million 
dollar Ponzi scheme, leaving her unable to assist him financially. 
  
In March 2012, Applicant’s wife submitted a personal financial statement, and in 
May 2012, Applicant did also. They reflected Applicant’s net monthly income as 
$3,517.98,18 and his wife’s net monthly income as $4,800.19 The monthly combined net 
income for them would be $8,317.98. He claimed $2,735 in monthly expenses and $45 
in debt payments, leaving a monthly net remainder of $782.98 available for 
discretionary spending or saving.20 She claimed $2,835 in monthly expenses and 
$2,310.59 in debt payments, leaving a monthly net remainder of minus $345.59 
available for discretionary spending or saving.21 They both included nearly the same 
monthly expenses. Therefore, it appears that they may have approximately a combined 
$3,227 available for discretionary spending or saving. Circumstances have changed, 
and Applicant now earns approximately $2,000 per month from his company, in addition 
to a pension of $1,600.22 Neither Applicant nor his wife ever received financial 
counseling.23 
 
 The SOR identified 22 (not counting the duplicate & 1.l.) purportedly continuing 
delinquencies, totaling approximately $1,250,812. Of those 22 accounts, Applicant has 
resolved or is in the process of resolving 10 of the accounts, and has not yet resolved 
the remaining 12 accounts. Each account is described below, reflecting both the original 
and present status, as follows: 
 
(SOR && 1.a. and 1.d.): These are both federal tax liens. The first one is a lien in 
the amount of $124,090.68 that was filed separately against Applicant and his wife in 
February 2011, covering unpaid payroll taxes for the last three quarters of 2009.24 
Applicant made garnishment payments on the balance when possible, and the balance

was reduced accordingly. It was subsequently declared “uncollectable.”25 The liens on 
two identified properties were released and discharged in April 2012.26 The second one, 
a lien in the amount of $119,214.78, was filed against Applicant and his wife in another 
state in April 2011, covering the same three quarters of 2009.27 As of December 2011, 
the remaining balance had decreased to $99,348.52.28 Applicant intends to satisfy both 
liens as soon as he can sell the houses, neither of which has a mortgage.29 One 
account is in deferment as uncollectable and the other account is in the process of 
being resolved.  
 
(SOR && 1.h., 1.i., and 1.b.): These are the first and second mortgages for the 
same residence. The first one is a first mortgage that had a past due balance of 
$389,918 for which foreclosure proceedings had been initiated.30 The other two 
accounts are actually two versions of the same second mortgage account, with the 
credit report referring to one as a home improvement loan that was past due in the 
amount of $65,000, and the other as a home equity line of credit that was past due in 
the amount of $134,543.31 Applicant and a buyer agreed to a short sale in April 2012,32 
and the mortgage lender approved a short sale in September 2012.33 The property was 
apparently sold,34 and the accounts appear to have been resolved. 
 
(SOR & 1.c.): This is a $150,000 line of credit not associated with any property 
that became $149,359 past due, and the account was subsequently charged off.35 
Applicant claimed he has been in contact with the creditor, and they are willing to accept 
an offer in compromise, but since Applicant is not yet in a position to make a significant 
payment, no documentation has been exchanged.36  The account remains unresolved.

(SOR & 1.e.): This is the mortgage for a rental property in the amount of 
$210,375 that was $10,631 past due.37 Applicant contended that the account was 
transferred to another company, but was unable to identify that company.38  Applicant 
and a buyer agreed to a short sale in the amount of $114,900 and the transaction was 
scheduled to close on or before May 15, 2012.39 However, there is no documentary 
evidence that the mortgage lender or the company that subsequently received the 
account agreed to the short sale and there is no documentary evidence that the 
property was actually sold. The account has not been resolved.

and a buyer agreed to a short sale and the transaction was scheduled to close on or 
before April 25, 2012.42 However, there is no documentary evidence that the mortgage

to pay state Q withholding tax, and as of April 2012, the total amount due was 
$2,417.29.43 That same month, he entered into a repayment agreement under which he 
would make monthly electronic fund transfers (EFT) of $74.44 Applicant also engaged 
the professional services of an accountant to resolve the account as there was some 
question as to whether the account was accurate.45 Although Applicant contended he 
was making the monthly payments,46 he offered no documentation in the form of

is a sales contract, the mortgage lender agreed to a short sale, or that the property was 
actually sold. The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR & 1.q.): This is the bank credit card with a high credit of $56,070 that was 
$9,455 past due, and charged off.63 The creditor made an offer to settle the account for 
one payment of $29,005, 24 payments totaling $31,920, or in full for $150 per month, 
but since Applicant is not yet in a position to make a significant payment (of even the 
$150 per month), no agreement has been reached.64 The account has not been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR & 1.r.): This is the bank credit card with a high credit of $55,655 that was 
$7,718 past due, and charged off.65 Applicant contends that the creditor is waiting for 
him to make an offer in compromise, but since he is not yet in a position to make a 
significant payment, no documentation has been exchanged and no offer has been 
made.66 However, he is incorrect, for when the creditor charged off the unpaid balance, 
it issued Applicant a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, and Applicant is no longer 
responsible for the debt to the creditor.67 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR & 1.s.): This is the bank credit card with a high credit of $13,314 that was 
$2,119 past due, and charged off.68 Applicant contends that the creditor is waiting for

Foreign Preference 
 
 Applicant received a monthly pension, much like Social Security, in the amount of 
$667.98, from the UK, and it was deposited directly into his local U.S. bank account.82 
The pension was subsequently reduced to between $400 and $600. Applicant applied 
for Social Security benefits in the United States, and the UK portion is now deducted 
from his U.S. benefits.83 He receives a total of about $1,600, divided into $1,090 from 
the United States and the remainder from the UK.84 He is willing to renounce his UK 
pension, and that amount would no longer be offset by Social Security. 
 
In May 2001, shortly after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant 
obtained a U.S. passport.85 He was subsequently issued a new UK passport in August 
2005, and he has retained his UK passport which does not expire until 2015.86 Applicant 
used his UK passport instead of his US passport for convenience to avoid the longer 
lines for non-UK citizens entering the UK.87 Although he had previously surrendered his 
UK passport to his facility security officer, he retrieved it in July 2012 to use it while 
traveling in the UK that same month.88 Applicant travelled to the UK to see his 
hospitalized sister and to attend a friend’s wedding.89 Friends warned him about 
“foreigners” going to England to see the Olympic Games and the long lines associated 
with such travel, so he decided to use his UK passport.90 Applicant “justified” the use of 
the UK passport for “easy access only due to Olympic traffic.”91 Both Applicant and his 
wife pledged their allegiance to the United States upon becoming naturalized citizens, 
and denied that their actions were associated with any preference for the UK.92 He 
stated: “I am American through and through.”93 The UK passports of both Applicant and

Character References  
 
 The director of the metropolitan economic development commission where 
Applicant’s company is located characterized Applicant as “sincere, genuine and 
trustworthy.”96 An attorney with a lengthy business relationship with Applicant and his 
company acknowledged that Applicant has a receivable account with her firm, which 
she attributed to current economic conditions. She characterized him as a man of 
integrity.97 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”98 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”99   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”100 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.101  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”102 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”103 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns.  The seeds of Applicant’s financial problems commenced sometime 
between 2004 and 2008 when a variety of conditions occurred. During the earlier 
portion of the period, he allowed his core business to drift when his focus was 
elsewhere. Later, economic conditions worsened, and the consequences were such 
that he was unable to continue making his monthly payments on mortgages, credit card 
accounts, lines of credit, and taxes. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for 
collection, charged off, or had liens filed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. When the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, AG ¶ 20(c) may apply. 
Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-
faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.104  
                                                          
104
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
 
15 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. Applicant’s financial problems commenced 
between 2004 and 2008 when a variety of conditions occurred. He allowed his core 
business to drift when his focus was elsewhere; economic conditions worsened and his 
company lost over 50 percent of his anticipated revenue when other companies with 
which he had been working suddenly curtailed their activities; the value of his rental 
properties plummeted; renters bailed out; a major investor withdrew from further 
investment activity; and Applicant made some poor decisions.  
While the business downturn and the devastation of the national and local 
economies were largely beyond Applicant’s control, some decisions made by him were 
clearly within his sole control. He kept his eye on the “brass ring” but failed to 
understand the full dynamics of the situation. Focusing on his big technology project – 
to the detriment of his core business – Applicant incurred substantial development 
expenses and costs. He gambled on success, and leveraged his rental properties to 
generate additional funds. He chased his losses hoping to cash in with eventual 
success. Applicant was confident that he was close to a breakthrough, and had to make 
a business decision of either shutting down his project and losing what he had already 
put into it, or continuing with his efforts. He needed more time and more money to 
accomplish his goals, so he chose the latter option. While he remains enthusiastic about 
his potential achievement, there is little evidence of actual success. Instead, Applicant 
has delivered hype, hope, and positive expectations, with few specifics. 
While Applicant’s financial difficulties commenced between 2004 and 2008, they 
have continued and deteriorated to the point where they cannot be considered 
infrequent. Whether they occurred under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur is 
a matter of opinion. The current economic climate was unanticipated and is akin to a 
hundred year storm or the economic recession of the 1930s. Applicant was either a 
technology visionary or a poor businessman, or both. His actions and decisions 
contributed to his financial problems, but did not cause them. However, while some of 
his decisions may, in retrospect, cast some doubt on his good judgment, they do not 
cast doubt on his current reliability or trustworthiness. After what appears to be a slow 
start in attempting to resolve his financial problems, Applicant eventually acted 
responsibly under the circumstances.  
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply because neither Applicant nor his wife ever received 
financial counseling. Applicant engaged the services of attorneys, accountants, and 
realtors to assist him in mitigating his financial losses, and there are indications that 
some accounts have been resolved or are in the process of being resolved. 
Nevertheless, it remains unclear if Applicant has more than a rudimentary 
understanding of the financial issues. 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

16 
                                      
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies. At the outset, Applicant is credited with laudable 
efforts in resolving the financial mess his former senior administrator left him with due to 
her embezzlement activities. Although not legally required to do so, he accepted the 
moral obligation and paid his creditors in full. The more recent financial problems have 
provided him with another opportunity to resolve his financial problems. Applicant 
contacted his creditors and eventually concluded that he should extricate himself from 
his burdensome mortgages. During this horrible housing market he put certain 
properties on the market and sought approval for short sales from his mortgage lenders. 
Some properties have been successfully sold, and he was absolved from any deficiency 
balances. Other properties are apparently awaiting short sale approval or actual 
closings, but since Applicant failed to furnish the necessary documentation to me, I am 
unable to conclude that those remaining accounts have been resolved. One lien has 
been placed into a period of deferment and he is, or at least was, making some monthly 
payments on it. Other delinquent accounts are in line, awaiting his attention.  
There is some concern that Applicant has not given his delinquent accounts the 
timely attention due them, and has instead wasted valuable time and money on other 
endeavors. It is unclear if he is putting his monthly net remainder towards delinquent 
debts or using it for other purposes. He was apparently unable to make more 
substantial debt payments but able to take foreign vacations while debts remained 
delinquent. Nevertheless, Applicant is finally acting responsibly under the 
circumstances,105 and showing reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to 
duty or obligation.  
Guideline C, Foreign Preference 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in 
AG ¶ 9:       
When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a 
foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of 
the United States. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 10(a), exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after 
becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member is 
potentially disqualifying. This includes but is not limited to possession of a current 
foreign passport under AG ¶ 10(a)(1). In May 2001, Applicant became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen, and obtained a U.S. passport. He obtained a new UK passport in August 
2005, and he has retained his UK passport which does not expire until 2015. Applicant 
used his UK passport instead of his US passport for convenience to avoid the longer 
lines for non-UK citizens entering the UK. Although he had previously surrendered his 
UK passport to his facility security officer, he retrieved it in July 2012 to use it while 
traveling in the UK that same month. The UK passport was returned to the facility

 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
 
17 
                                      
 
security officer upon his return from the UK. As noted above, Applicant pledged his 
allegiance to the United States upon becoming a naturalized citizen, and denied that his 
actions were associated with any preference for the UK. He stated: “I am American 
through and through.” By his actions, Applicant exercised the rights and privileges of 
foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. AG ¶¶ 10(a)(1) has been established. 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from foreign preference.  Under AG ¶ 11(b), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual 
citizenship. Similarly, AG ¶ 11(e) may apply where the passport has been destroyed, 
surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated. 
 Dual citizenship, by itself, is not an automatic bar to a security clearance. It is 
only a security concern if the individual has actively exercised the rights and privileges 
of the foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. Applicant, a naturalized U.S. 
citizen, stated unequivocally that he is willing to renounce his UK citizenship. He 
explained that his only motivation for using his UK passport was not an indication of a 
preference for the UK over the United States, but rather solely for his personal 
convenience in entering the UK. Such actions have security significance. Thus, as to 
Applicant’s dual citizenship, and his possession and use of the UK passport, 
considering Applicant’s explanations, and his subsequent actions, I find ¶¶ 11(b) and 
11(e) apply.  
 
As noted above, Applicant also exercised the rights and privileges of UK 
citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen by receiving a very small pension from the UK. 
Applicant explained it was a small amount similar to Social Security available to senior 
citizens, and he was a qualified recipient. There is no evidence that Applicant was 
aware at the time he exercised such a UK citizenship right and privilege that it had any 
U.S. security significance. Applicant was both open and forthright about the pension. 
The experience does not reflect an attitude by Applicant of greed or entitlement. 
Considering the relatively small amount of money involved, under the circumstances 
herein, including the fact that his acceptance of the UK pension was not alleged in the 
SOR or the Amendment to the SOR, it is of minimal security significance. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:106 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He actively 
exercised the rights and privileges of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. 
Also, his handling of the family, investment, and company finances permitted numerous 
accounts to become delinquent. As a result, accounts were placed for collection, 
charged off, or became tax liens. He and his wife took foreign vacations while debts 
remained delinquent. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. As 
noted above, due to a combination of events, both beyond his control and within his 
control, Applicant’s financial situation deteriorated. Promising investments were 
leveraged to generate funds sufficient for Applicant’s business to survive. With the 
devastated economy, they became albatrosses. Applicant contacted his creditors in an 
effort to resolve his financial problems. The SOR identified 22 (not counting the 
duplicate & 1.l.) purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling approximately 
$1,250,812. Of those 22 accounts, Applicant has resolved or is in the process of 
resolving 10 of the accounts, and has not yet resolved the remaining 12 accounts. He

turned to an attorney, an accountant, and a realtor for guidance, and attempted to 
disengage himself from his delinquent mortgages by seeking mortgage lender approval 
of short sales. Some were successful, and others may have been. He acted honorably 
after he and his company were victims of employee embezzlement, and he is acting 
honorably by choosing to repay his debts and not seeking discharge under bankruptcy. 
Applicant is a good husband and father, with exceptional expertise in certain technology 
capabilities. Until the national economy was devastated, he was a successful investor.  
 I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.107 Applicant has 
demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt reduction and elimination. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and his foreign 
preference.108 See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
108
 Although I have concluded that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns cited in the SOR and 
Amendment to the SOR, this decision should also be considered by Applicant to be a warning that any failure to 
continue his debt resolution efforts, creating additional delinquent debt, or using his foreign passport in the future, will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for access to classified information.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
