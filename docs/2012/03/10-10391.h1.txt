FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on April 9, 2010. On 
September 27, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified him 
that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
him access to classified information, and it recommended that his case be submitted to 
an administrative judge for a determination whether to deny his application. DOHA set 
forth the basis for its action in a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing security concerns 
under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

 Applicant received the SOR on October 9, 2011; answered it on October 18, 
2011; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the 
request on October 21, 2011. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December 
8, 2011, and the case was assigned to me on December 15, 2011. DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing on January 23, 2012, scheduling it to be conducted by video 
teleconference on February 13, 2012. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Department Counsel submitted a demonstrative exhibit summarizing the evidence, 
which is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through N, which were admitted without objection. 
I kept the record open until February 29, 2012, to enable Applicant to submit additional 
documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX O and P. Department Counsel’s 
comments regarding AX O and P are attached to the record as HX II. DOHA received 
the transcript (Tr.) on February 22, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.e, but he denied that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d were unpaid, explaining that 
he was making payments on those four debts. His admissions in his answer and at the 
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received a 
security clearance in September 2000, but it was administratively terminated when he 
left federal employment in March 2004. 
 
 Applicant graduated from college in May 1989, and he received a master’s 
degree in forensic sciences in September 1991. (AX A at 9-11.) He married in January 
1994. He and his wife have five children, ages 16, 12, 10, 7, and 5. 
 
 Applicant was employed as a city police officer from 1991 to 1996. He was 
named Police Officer of the Year in 1993, received numerous accolades, and was 
featured in local newspapers. (AX E at 1-11.) He worked as a county police officer in 
1996 and 1997 and again received numerous awards and accolades. (AX G at 1-13.) 
He was a federal law enforcement agent from December 1997 to March 2004. (AX F at 
1-7.) He was employed as an asset protection executive for a large retail chain from 
March 2004 to November 2005. He worked as chief of security and probation for a state 
court from November 2005 to July 2007. He was the global security manager for a 
major computer manufacturer from July 2007 to February 2009, when he was laid off 
due to a reduction in force. (AX L.) He was unemployed until he began working as 
global security manager for his current employer in October 2009. (GX 1 at 16-26.) 
 
 About seven years ago, Applicant’s wife began a pattern of excessive alcohol 
consumption and abuse of prescription drugs, triggered by the death of her mother. (Tr. 
32.) She underwent detoxification and counseling several times without success. At 
about the time Applicant was laid off in February 2009, she had a major relapse, 
 
3 
 
 
requiring additional detoxification, treatment, and counseling. Applicant estimated that 
he had out-of-pocket expenses of between $5,000 and $10,000 for her multiple efforts 
at detoxification and treatment. (Tr. 52.) While she was undergoing extensive inpatient 
treatment, Applicant was solely responsible for the care of their five children, in addition 
to job-hunting and managing the family finances. The combination of unemployment, 
additional medical expenses for his wife’s treatment, and the burden of being solely 
responsible for his family caused him to fall behind on the first and second mortgages 
on their home as well as several other debts.  
 
 Applicant’s wife has been in recovery for about a year. She is trained as a 
registered nurse and is now seeking employment. (AX O; Tr. 49-50.) 
 
 All the debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in Applicant’s April 2010 and June 
2011 credit reports. (GX 3 and 4.) The evidence concerning the status of the five 
delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a (credit card--$1,724). Applicant made monthly $238 payments on 
this debt from March 2010 to September 2011. He is now paying about $64 per month. 
As of December 2011, this debt had been reduced to $579. (AX J; Tr. 38-39.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b (2nd mortgage--$52,000). In February 2012, Applicant entered into a 
“temporary payment arrangement” providing for 24 biweekly payments of $162.52, to be 
paid through February 2013. (AX M.) Applicant is making payments as agreed, and he 
intends to continue the payment arrangement for about four years, although he does not 
have a written payment agreement extending beyond February 2013. (Tr. 43.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c (credit card--$4,174). Applicant has been making monthly $50 
payments on this debt since October 2010. (AX I.) I granted Department Counsel’s 
motion to withdraw this allegation on the ground that this debt was his wife’s individual 
account and Applicant was only an authorized user of the account. (Tr. 66-67.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d (credit card--$7,099). Applicant has been making monthly $100 
payments on this debt since September 2011. (Answer to SOR at 12; AX H; AX N; Tr. 
44-45.) I granted Department Counsel’s motion to withdraw this allegation on the same 
ground as SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 66-67.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e (first mortgage--$257,635). Applicant and his wife listed their home 
for sale in November 2009, asking $339,900. (GX 2 at 45-46.) In January 2010, they 
reduced the asking price to $329,900. (GX 2 at 34.) In May 2010, they decided to 
pursue a short sale, reducing the asking price to $250,000. (GX 2 at 35-38.) They 
received an offer and sent the lender a request for approval of a short sale on July 16, 
2010. However, on July 19, 2010, the property was sold at a foreclosure sale. (GX 2 at 
33.) Appellant received an IRS Form 1099-A from the lender reflecting a fair market 
value of $225,000.1 (AX P.) He has not received an IRS Form 1099-C reflecting 
                                                          
1 IRS Instructions for Forms 1099-A and 1099-C (2012) provide: “Generally, the gross foreclosure bid 
price is considered to be the FMV [fair market value of a foreclosed property].”  
 
4 
 
 
cancellation of the potential deficiency after foreclosure. As of the date of the hearing, 
the lender had not taken any action to collect a deficiency. Applicant has not yet made 
any arrangements to resolve the potential deficiency, because he has been triaging his 
debts and concentrating on the four debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d. He testified he 
intends to fulfill his obligations with the lender. He and his wife have considered the 
possibility of rolling any deficiency into a new loan from the same lender. (Tr. 48-49, 59-
60.)  
 
 Applicant’s gross annual salary is about $111,600, and he earns an additional 
$31,900 as an adjunct university professor. He estimates that his net monthly income is 
about $6,800. His expenses, including a $350 car payment, are about $4,500. (Tr. 55.) 
His monthly payments on the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d total about 
$539, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $1,761. He is living modestly, and none 
of his current financial obligations are delinquent.  
 
 When Applicant applied for graduate school, his application was supported by 
numerous friends and associates, all of whom described him as honest, highly 
motivated, with a strong sense of responsibility. (AX A at 1-8.) While in graduate school 
he co-authored a forensic science article on a scholarly publication. In February and 
June 2004, he authored two articles on industrial crisis response and workplace 
violence in a foreign publication directed toward chief executive officers of major 
corporations. (AX A at 13-27.) His applications for employment in law enforcement 
positions were supported by numerous friends and professional colleagues, who 
extolled his personal and intellectual qualities. (AX D.) 
 
 Applicant is deeply religious and devoted to his family. (AX B; AX C.) He is a 
swimming coach at his children’s’ school, a volunteer at a homeless center, and 
involved in religious education of children for his church. (Tr. 70-71.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
5 
 
 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges three delinquent credit card accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 
1.d) and delinquent first and second mortgages on a family home (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e). 
Department Counsel withdrew the allegations regarding the two credit card accounts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. 
 
 
6 
 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two disqualifying 
conditions: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a 
history of not meeting financial obligations”). 
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established because Applicant has three delinquent debts that are not 
yet resolved. They did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur, 
because Applicant is not immune from being laid off again, and his wife’s addictions 
may cause future relapses and uninsured medical expenses. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established.  
 
 Applicant’s unemployment and his wife’s addictions were circumstances beyond 
his control. He stayed in contact with his creditors and made payment arrangements, 
even before he received the SOR. He made reasonable efforts to resolve his delinquent 
mortgage but was unable to prevent foreclosure, even though he had a reasonable 
short-sale offer. He intends to resolve the deficiency remaining after the foreclosure. I 
conclude that AG ¶ 20(b) is established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  
 
 A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to 
 
7 
 
 
establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish 
a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. 
There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts 
simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid 
first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  
 
 Applicant is methodically repaying his delinquent credit card debts and the 
delinquent second mortgage, which is his largest delinquent debt. He has a reputation 
for honesty, reliability, and a strong sense of personal responsibility. The amount of the 
potential deficiency on the first mortgage is affordable with his current income. I am 
confident that once he is relieved of the uncertainty about his security clearance and 
future employment, he will act responsibly to resolve any deficiency remaining from the 
foreclosed first mortgage.  
 
 A promise to pay a delinquent debt in the future is not a substitute for a track 
record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 
19, 2008). However, I found Applicant’s promise to resolve any potential foreclosure 
deficiency credible, because it is corroborated by his track record of responsibly 
resolving the other delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is 
established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a mature, well-educated, talented adult. He has a long career in law 
enforcement and industrial asset protection. He has held a security clearance in the 
 
8 
 
 
past, apparently without incident. Although his wife suffered from alcohol and 
prescription drug addiction for many years, he was able to keep his family together and 
his finances under control until he was laid off in February 2009. Notwithstanding his 
wife’s addictions and the loss of the family home, he has steadfastly worked to care for 
his children, help his wife obtain treatment and counseling to overcome her addictions, 
and restore his financial stability. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. 
The evidence leaves me convinced of his honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.d:    Withdrawn 
  Subparagraph 1.e:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
granted.
