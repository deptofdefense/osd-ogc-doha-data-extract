APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On August 9, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
2
the basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a decision on the written record.  On December 30, 2011, after considering the record,
Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.
Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief makes no assertion of harmful error by the Judge.  The brief states
that Applicant will pay two of the three debts which the Judge found against him if, by doing so, he
will receive a security clearance.  Our authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the
appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29; see also
ISCR Case No. 10-09349 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2011).  Therefore, the Judge’s adverse security
clearance decision is AFFIRMED.
