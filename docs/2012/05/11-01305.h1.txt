TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline F 
(financial considerations). Clearance is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 13, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86). On January 
11, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant, deny, continue, or revoke a security clearance for 
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for 
a determination whether his clearance should be denied, granted, continued, or 
revoked.

On February 9, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
On March 2, 2012, Department Counsel was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On 
March 28, 2012, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On April 6, 2012, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for April 24, 2012. (Tr. 7) Applicant’s hearing 
was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant did not 
offer any exhibits. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1-5) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5. 
(Tr. 21-22) On May 1, 2012, I received the transcript of the hearing. I held the record 
open until May 11, 2012, to provide Applicant an opportunity to provide additional 
documentation. (Tr. 83, 86, 104) On May 2, 2012, Applicant provided 15 post-hearing 
documents, which were admitted without objection. (AE 1-15)   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a to 1.c. He also provided explanations for the SOR allegations. His admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old information-technology specialist for a defense 
contractor. (Tr. 23, 29; GE 1) He became unemployed two months before his hearing. 
(Tr. 30) His monthly unemployment compensation is $2,000. (Tr. 34) A defense 
contractor plans to hire Applicant, if he receives a security clearance. (Tr. 30) He 
believes his annual salary will be about $160,000. (Tr. 33) His spouse has full-time 
employment in property management with an annual salary of about $120,000. (Tr. 32, 
63)  
 
Applicant and his spouse married in 2000. (GE 1) Applicant has a five-month-old 
baby, and his other three children are ages 10, 11, and 13. (Tr. 26-27) He provides 
$500 to $700 monthly financial assistance to his 23-year-old step daughter, who does 
not live with Applicant and his spouse. (Tr. 24-25, 28)  
 
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in business with a major in management 
information systems. (Tr. 28) During his employment in information technology, he has 
earned about six technical certifications. (Tr. 29) He has never served in the military. 
(GE 1) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
From 2006 to 2009, Applicant was unemployed for about 20 months, and from 
2008 to 2009, his spouse was unemployed for about eight months. (Tr. 97-98) She was 
also briefly unemployed in 2005. (Tr. 100) For the last five years, she has averaged 
annual income of $100,000. (Tr. 98)

Applicant disclosed his delinquent debts in his July 13, 2010 SF-86. (GE 1) He 
disclosed a total of 13 delinquent or previously delinquent accounts or unfiled federal 
income taxes, and eight of them were settled or satisfied as follows: (1) credit card debt 
in May 2010; (2) filed overdue federal income tax returns in May 2010 – either no taxes 
were due or Applicant received a refund; (3) credit card debt in May 2010; (4) credit 
card debt in April 2010; (5) credit card debt in April 2010; (6) credit card debt in 
February 2010; (7) credit card debt in December 2009; and (8) mortgage debt in 
February 2007. (GE 1) One credit card debt was expected to be paid in full by 
September 2010. (GE 1 at 60) In January 2010, he stopped making payments on a 
mortgage loan on an investment property, and in May 2010, he planned to put the 
investment property on the real estate market. (GE 1 at 62)  
 
The three debts listed on his July 13, 2010 SF-86 were not resolved and were 
listed on the SOR. For the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a for $48,071, he said that he was 
“[l]ooking to cure this [judgment] by beginning a payment plan in October 2010 or 
proceeds from a real estate liquidation.” (GE 1 at 58) For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for 
delinquent interest in the amount of $6,612, Applicant disclosed that he was behind 
seven months on a $349,875 mortgage, and his solution was to seek a loan 
modification. (GE 1 at 61) For the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.c for $29,038, he said that he 
was “working out a payment plan and/or settlement directly with the bank’s collection 
department, [and he was l]ooking to establish a repayment to begin October 2010 
and/or through liquidation of real estate.” (Tr. 68-69; GE 1 at 59) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($48,071)—Unresolved. In October 2005, Applicant borrowed 
$50,000 on a line of credit. (Tr. 51; SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant used the line of credit for living 
expenses and for a remodeling business. (Tr. 52) Applicant said he stayed in touch with 
the creditor by telephoning every five months or so, and he made a $7,215 settlement 
offer, to be paid with monthly $120 payments for five years. (Tr. 55, 59, 65-66; AE 3) He 
urged the creditor to accept this offer because of Applicant’s hardship situation; 
however, the creditor rejected his offer. (AE E) On August 22, 2008, Applicant wrote the 
court handling the judgment that his wife was laid off on June 30, 2008, and she 
provided the family their only steady income. (AE 3) He said, “My income is from Real 
Estate commissions, which have been $0.00 for the past two years.” (AE 3) On 
September 19, 2008, and October 1, 2008, the creditor wrote to Applicant and wanted 
about $25,000 in a lump sum to settle the debt. (AE 3, Tr. 67) On January 12, 2011, 
Applicant offered to settle the debt for a lump sum payment of $10,000. (AE 6) On 
January 19, 2011, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $20,000. (AE 6) On May 23, 
2011, the creditor rejected Applicant’s offer to settle the judgment for $10,000. (AE 6) 
Applicant most recently communicated with the creditor in the summer of 2011. (Tr. 60) 
He still plans to attempt to resolve this debt; however, he wants to have stable 
employment before trying to set up a payment plan. (Tr. 56, 65-66)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($6,612)—Unresolved. In 2004, Applicant and his spouse purchased 
their residence for $680,000, and they put 20 percent down. (Tr. 40, 73) They obtained 
a loan modification, and the mortgage balance on their first mortgage is now $636,000. 
(Tr. 48, 75; GE 3 at 155) The monthly mortgage payment on their first mortgage is 
$3,013. (Tr. 49, 72; GE 3 at 153) In 2006, Applicant and his spouse borrowed $484,000, 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
secured by their residence, and they used the funds to purchase investment property C 
for $475,000. (Tr. 40-41, 71, 73-74) Applicant fell behind on the payments for the 
$484,000 equity line of credit, and his credit report indicated he had delinquent interest 
charges of $6,612. (Tr. 71) Applicant and his spouse have not made any payments on 
the $484,000 equity line of credit in at least a year, and they are diligently pursuing a 
loan modification on that debt. (Tr. 77)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($29,038)—Unresolved. Applicant received an unsecured line of 
credit from a bank, and he said he was unable to make his payments. (Tr. 79-80) In 
2010, the bank obtained a judgment for $29,038. (HE 3) The creditor put a lien on 
Applicant’s bank account; however, Applicant was able to convince the court to lift the 
lien. (Tr. 79) In 2008, he entered into a payment agreement with the creditor where he 
promised to pay $600 a month. (Tr. 80) He made payments for six months. (Tr. 80) 
Then he entered into a period of unemployment and underemployment. (Tr. 80) 
Applicant was waiting until he had better employment stability before making a 
settlement offer on the debt. (Tr. 79) He has not made any payments to this creditor in 
at least a year.   
 
In 2002, Applicant and his spouse purchased a townhome for $181,000, and 
then they sold it for $225,000. (Tr. 39) Applicant and his spouse purchased Property C 
for $475,000, which has a current market value of $250,000. (Tr. 38) They used funds 
from the equity loan they obtained on their residence. Property C requires about 
$150,000 in rehabilitation work, and then it will be worth about $400,000. (Tr. 38) There 
is no mortgage on property C.  
 
Applicant and his spouse purchased property N with a $312,000 mortgage. (Tr. 
41) In 2007, Applicant provided a deed in lieu of foreclosure to the lender holding the 
mortgage loan, and there was no deficiency. (Tr. 41-43) 
 
In 2008, Applicant and his spouse purchased property R with a $176,000 
mortgage. (Tr. 43, 46) In August 2011, the mortgage loan was resolved with a short 
sale. (Tr. 43-45) They received a 1099 for about $42,000. (Tr. 45)  In addition to 
resolving debts with the majority of his creditors described above, Applicant took the 
extraordinary step of moving his family out of their five bedroom suburban home in 2008 
to a two bedroom condominium (property R) in an urban setting. He did this to generate 
rental income and reduce his living expenses. Applicant described the time when his 
family was living in a condominium in close quarters as “very trying.” (Tr. 43-47) 
 
Applicant provided ample documentation demonstrating his efforts to remain in 
contact with his creditors during this time as well as good-faith efforts to resolve his 
debts. (AE A, AE B) His personal financial statement (PFS) reflects that Applicant is 
living within his means, is current on his remaining bills, and exercises prudent spending 
habits. (GE 3 at 149, AE 1-15)

Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided multiple recommendations from managers, clients, 
supervisors, colleagues, and a recruiter of his company. They lauded his hard work, 
professionalism, technical competence, loyalty, and goal-directed mission 
accomplishment.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
SF-86, credit reports, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR debts became delinquent in 2009. His SOR alleges three 
delinquent debts, totaling $83,721. The Government established the disqualifying 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of ¶¶ 20(a), 
20(b), and 20(d).2 AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable because he did not dispute any of the 
SOR debts. He paid, settled, or satisfied seven debts from December 2009 to May 
2010, as indicated on his SF-86. He said he expected a delinquent credit card debt to 
be paid by September 2010, and I have credited him with resolving this debt in 2010.  
 
Unemployment, underemployment, some medical debts, and the real estate 
downturn were circumstances largely beyond Applicant’s control that adversely affected 
                                            
2
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

his finances. Applicant acted responsibly and made good progress resolving his 
delinquent debts until January 2011. He maintained contact with his creditors and 
attempted to establish payment plans. He hired attorneys and made multiple settlement 
offers. He divested himself of several real estate properties and avoided additional 
delinquent debt.  
 
Although Applicant did not receive formal financial counseling, he did generate a 
budget or PFS. He understands how to establish his financial responsibility and 
eliminate delinquent debt.  
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts because of unemployment, 
underemployment, some medical debts, and the real estate downturn. In 2010, he 
made excellent progress and resolved most of his delinquent debts. Although 
Applicant’s financial situation is not completely resolved, it is clear that he has made 
reasonable and diligent efforts to resolve his debts to the best of his ability. What the 
SOR does not reflect are the debts he has paid and the ongoing good-faith efforts he 
has made to resolve his remaining debts.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There are sufficient facts supporting mitigation of security concerns under the 
whole-person concept. Applicant is loyal to the United States. Applicant is a 39-year-old 
information-technology specialist with strong professional credentials. If Applicant 
receives a security clearance, a defense contractor plans to hire Applicant, and his 
annual salary will be about $160,000. Unemployment, underemployment, medical 
problems, and the real estate downturn were events beyond Applicant’s control, which 
adversely affected his finances. His PFS (when Applicant was employed) shows he had

about $5,500 available each month to address his debts, and he had funds in his 
savings account. Most notably are the efforts Applicant made to resolve debts not 
alleged to in his SOR. I found his documented efforts to mitigate his situation 
compelling. These efforts included moving his family from a five bedroom home to a two 
bedroom condominium. 
 
Applicant is sufficiently intelligent and mature to understand and comply with 
security requirements. He has the ability and intelligence to establish his financial 
responsibility. His character references and evaluations establish that he is a dedicated, 
reliable, and trustworthy employee. He is knowledgeable, patriotic, and professional, 
and he made substantial contributions to his employer.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has fully 
mitigated the financial consideration concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
