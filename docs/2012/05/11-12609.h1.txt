DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Based upon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
On May 26, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 15, 2012, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of 
Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR on March 9, 2012, and requested that the case be 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 21, 2012, Department 
Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing eight Items; and 
 
2 
 
 
mailed Applicant a complete copy on March 26, 2012. Applicant received the FORM on 
April 4, 2012, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional 
information. Applicant timely submitted exhibits that I later marked as Items A and B and 
admitted into the record without objection from Department Counsel. On May 3, 2012, 
DOHA assigned the case to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her response, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1. b, 
1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q. of the SOR. She denied the remaining 
allegations. Some of those denials are based on Applicant’s position that she paid or is 
paying them, and some because they are duplicates.  
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old single woman. She has two adult children, ages 26 
and 23. She earned an associate’s degree in the late 2000’s. In May 2011 she started a 
position as a help desk coordinator for a defense contractor. She was unemployed from 
October 2010 until she obtained her position. From June 2006 until October 2010 she 
worked for a telephone company. From January 2004 to August 2006 she worked for 
the Department of Defense (DoD). She held a security clearance during her previous 
employment with DoD. (Item 4.) 
 
 After completing her e-QIP in May 2011, Applicant met with a government 
investigator to discuss her delinquent debts in August 2011. During that interview, she 
acknowledged her debts and explained that they began accumulating in 2005 when her 
work hours were reduced. Subsequently, her former boyfriend refused to pay debts that 
they incurred together. She indicated that she would pay them when she had sufficient 
income. (Item 5 at 8.) 
 
Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated April 2004, June 2011, and January 
2012, the SOR alleged 17 delinquent debts totaling $14,297. Applicant’s history of 
financial problems began sometime in 2002 according to the April 2004 CBR. The debts 
listed in the SOR accumulated between 2005 and 2009. The status of each of the 17 
debts is as follows: 
 
Three debts are paid: (1) ¶ 1.k ($59); (2) ¶ 1.m ($187); and (3) ¶ 1.o 
($87). They total $278. 
 
Six debts totaling $3,380 are included in a monthly debt repayment 
plan that Applicant began on October 24, 2011: (4) ¶ 1.g ($477); (5) ¶ 1.h 
($175); (6) ¶ 1.i ($781); (7) ¶ 1.l ($1,002); (8) ¶ 1.n ($350); and (9) ¶ 1.p 
($595). Applicant has made monthly payments of between $99 and $150 
toward the debts. (Item 3 at 5-7.) The debts are being resolved. 
 
Three SOR-listed judgments total $6,107 and are owed to the same 
apartment creditor: (10) ¶ 1.a ($1,517); (11) ¶ 1.b ($1,071); and (12) ¶ 1.c 
($3,519). Per Applicant’s contact with the creditor, the outstanding balance 
 
3 
 
 
is $1,956.1 It appears that two judgments may be duplicates. She paid 
$100 toward the debt on January 4, 2012. (Item 5 at 3, 15, 16.) She 
started to resolve the debt. 
 
Three SOR-listed judgments total $3,778 and are owed to another 
apartment creditor: (13) ¶ 1.d ($682); (14) ¶ 1.e ($1,314); and (15) ¶ 1.f 
($1,780). Per Applicant’s contact with the creditor, the outstanding balance 
is $1,780.2 It appears that two judgments may be duplicates. She paid 
$100 on the debt on January 4, 2012. (Item 5 at 17.) She started to 
resolve the debt. 
 
The 2008 tax lien, (16) ¶ 1.q ($395), is unresolved and noted on an 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcript issued to Applicant in January 
2012. (Item 5 at 25.)  
 
One debt, (17) ¶ 1.j ($361), owed to a cable company remains 
unresolved. 
 
At this time, Applicant resolved $6,425 of the SOR total. After investigating 
the six alleged judgments, she learned that the balance owed to both apartment 
creditors totals $3,736; not $9,885.  In January 2012 she made a $100 payment 
to each creditor. She paid $278 to resolve three debts. She executed a $3,380 
repayment plan to resolve six debts.  She is slowly resolving $7,852 of delinquent 
debt. She has yet to resolve a $395 tax bill for 2008 and a $361 debt owed to a 
cable company. She earns $13 per hour and lives with a relative. In January 
2012 her net monthly income was $1,620. Her budget listed only $150 in 
expenses, and did not include payments into the repayment plan or on the 
judgments, which appear to total about $350. (Item 5 at 14.) Other than financial 
problems, the file does not contain derogatory information. (Item 4.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching

 Although one credit bureau reports three judgments for different amounts, information from the creditor 
documents an amount owed as $1,956. Said document is given greater weight than the credit reports.

adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” Section 7 
of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.

AG ¶ 19 notes two disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy SOR-listed debts that began 
accumulating in 2005 and continue into the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise 
these two potentially disqualifying conditions. 
 
After the Government produced substantial evidence of those two 
disqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove 
mitigation. AG ¶ 20 sets out three conditions that could mitigate the financial security 
concerns raised in this case.  
 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
Applicant presented evidence that the accumulation of delinquent debt resulted 
after a long period of reduced work hours and unemployment, and her former 
boyfriend’s refusal to pay his share of their combined debt. Those were conditions 
beyond her control. However, other than the fact that she accumulated less than $8,000 
in delinquencies despite these problems, she did not provide sufficient evidence 
documenting that she attempted to responsibly manage her debts while they were 
accumulating. Hence, AG ¶ 20(b) has limited application. 
 
Applicant established some mitigation under AG & 20(c). She did not submit 
evidence that she received credit or financial counseling, but she provided proof that 
she began resolving six debts totaling $3,380 in October 2011 through a repayment 
plan. After contacting the creditors for the judgments listed on the SOR and determining 
that the balances were substantially less than alleged in the SOR, in January 2012 she 
made a $100 payment to both creditors on the $1,956 and $1,780 accounts. Her actions 
to date indicate that her financial problems are beginning to come under control and 
support a limited application AG & 20(c). The payments to three creditors and payments 
into a repayment plan to resolve six debts demonstrate a good-faith effort to pay or 
resolve debts. AG & 20(d) has some application.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). They include the following:  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
  
    I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 43-year-old woman, who 
has worked for a defense contractor since May 2011. She previously worked for DoD 
from January 2004 until August 2006 and held a security clearance. At this point she 
has reduced the amount of delinquent debt listed in the SOR from $14,297 to $7,872. 
She paid $278 to resolve three debts and started a repayment plan to pay six debts 
totaling $3,380 in October 2011, before the February 2012 SOR issued. Recently, she 
researched six judgments noted in the SOR and learned that the combined balance 
owed to both creditors is $3,736 and not $9,885. She is aware of her outstanding 2008 
tax debt. The $361 debt is also unresolved. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that 
she will continue resolving her debts.  
 
Overall, the record evidence does not create doubt as to Applicant’s present 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:             For Applicant

     Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
