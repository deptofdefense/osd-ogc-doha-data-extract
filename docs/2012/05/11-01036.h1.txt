NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Departmentâ€™s intent to deny his eligibility for a 
security clearance to work in the defense industry. After a family tragedy prevented him 
from working between February 2008 and March 2010, Applicant accumulated over 
$18,000 in delinquent debt and failed to file his federal and state tax returns for a 
number of years. Since returning to full-time employment in March 2010, he has 
rehabilitated his finances by resolving his delinquent debts and filling his outstanding tax 
returns. Clearance is granted.
