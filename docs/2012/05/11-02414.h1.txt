Decision

DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), but failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 2, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines 
F and E. DOHA took that action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
On September 6, 2011, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. 
The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge on January 12, 2012, 
and was reassigned to me on February 27, 2012. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on 
March 20, 2012, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 29, 2012. At 
 
2 
 
the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 that 
were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s list of exhibits was 
marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) A through T that were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was left 
open until April 19, 2012, for Applicant to submit additional matters. She timely 
submitted additional documents that were marked as AE U through BB and admitted 
into evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s memorandum indicating she had 
no objections to Applicant’s post-hearing submissions was marked as HE 2. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2012.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
Under Subparagraph E3.1.8 of the Directive, an applicant shall be notified at 
least 15 days in advance of the time and place of the hearing. In this case, Applicant did 
not receive the required notice. However, she discussed the proposed hearing date with 
Department Counsel before the Notice of Hearing was issued and requested that the 
hearing be held as soon as possible. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that she was 
ready to proceed and affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old merchant marine seaman who works periodically for a 
defense contractor. She has worked for that contractor since October 2009. She 
graduated from high school in 1979 and earned an associate’s degree in nursing in 
2005. In the past, she has been employed as a nurse. She is married and has been 
divorced twice. Her first marriage was from September 1978 to October 1987 and her 
second was from June 1996 to November 2007. She has three children, ages 26, 30, 
and 31. This is the first time that she has applied for a security clearance.2 
 
 Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant filed bankruptcy on three 
occasions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.c) and had 23 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d – 1.z) totaling 
$116,611. In her Answer, Applicant admitted the three bankruptcy allegations, admitted 
and denied some of the debt allegations, and failed to address five debt allegations 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.p, 1.w, 1.x, and 1.z). At the hearings, she was asked to admit or deny 
the five debt allegations that she failed to address. Her admission or denial of each debt 
allegation is reflected in the table below. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that 
Applicant falsified her security clearance application (SCA) dated October 24, 2009, by 
answering “No” to four questions about her financial record (SOR ¶¶ 2.a – 2.d). In her 
Answer, she did not address the four falsification allegations, but denied each of them at 
the hearing.3

 Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 1998. This bankruptcy was 
dismissed in January 1999. She again filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 1999, 
which was dismissed in April 2001. In April 2002, she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and 
received a discharge of her debts that same year. At the hearing, she testified that she 
did not remember the amount of the debts that were discharged in her Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. She stated that she filed bankruptcy because she and her ex-husband had 
a mobile home that was voluntarily repossessed and she filed to make him solely 
responsible for that debt. She noted that, before the repossession, she was giving him 
the money to make the mortgage payments and he failed to make four monthly 
payments.4 
 
 Applicant attributed most of her current financial problems to her second ex-
husband. Her and her ex-husband’s names were very similar. Her nickname was the 
same as his first name. They had the same middle initial and, at that time, the same last 
name. While they were married, the name she regularly used was identical to his name. 
The similarity in their names apparently created confusion and some of his debts were 
listed as hers. Most notably, the child support arrearages in the amount of $95,868 in 
SOR ¶ 1.w is her ex-husband’s debt. She initially filed for divorce from her second 
husband in 2001 or 2002 and believed she was divorced. In about 2006, she learned 
that she was not divorced. She filed again and obtained a divorce in 2007. She 
indicated that, when they were living together and again in about 2007, she learned that 
he had opened accounts using her social security number. She said that he also used 
her daughter’s social security number to open accounts. She filed fraud alerts with the 
credit reporting agencies and currently pays for a credit monitoring service to protect 
against future fraud.5 
 
 As a merchant marine seaman, Applicant deploys regularly on ships. She 
normally works in four-month intervals. She files for, and collects, unemployment 
compensation for the months she is unemployed between deployments. Last year, she 
was unemployed for nine months because she did not have a security clearance, and 
she also had surgery during that period of unemployment.6 
 
 During an interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
in October 2010, Applicant indicated that she was unaware of most of the delinquent 
debts that were then listed on her credit report. At that time, she stated that she planned 
to inquire into the debts and either dispute them or pay them.7  
 
 Applicant’s alleged debts are addressed in the table below.

 Applicant testified openly and honestly at the hearing. She has not received any 
financial counseling. She indicated that she has about $2,000 in the bank. She 
estimated that she earned $25,000 during the four months she worked in 2011 and 
usually earns about $50,000 per year. Her husband is also a merchant marine seaman, 
and they deploy together. She provided a budget for the first three months of 2012. It 
reflected that, in January 2012, her total income was $5,031 and her total expenditures 
were $3,122, which left her a net month remainder of $1,908. However, her income and 
expenses fluctuate. She indicated that she and her husband were meeting their current 
expenses. Her bills are electronically deducted from her account to ensure payments 
are made while she is deployed.8 
 
 On October 24, 2009, Applicant submitted a SCA in which she responded “No” to 
all of the financial questions. Specifically, she responded No” to these four questions:  
 
 a. Section 26e that asked if she had a judgment entered against her in the past 
seven years; 
 
 b. Section 26g that asked if she had bills or debts turned over to a collection 
agency in the past seven years;  
 
 c. Section 26m that asked if she had been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debts in the last seven years, and  
 
 d. Section 26n that asked if she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debts.  
 
At the hearing, she testified that she was not aware of the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.d and 
the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.e was not her debt. However, she testified that, when she filled 
out the SCA, she knew she had bills that were turned over to collection agencies and 
knew that she had delinquent debts that met the other reporting requirements. She 
could not explain why she answered “no” to those questions.  She indicated that she 
was not trying to lie or hide any information, but may have misinterpreted the 
questions.9

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant received a bankruptcy discharge in 2002. Not long thereafter, she 
began incurring delinquent debts that she was unable or unwilling to satisfy for several 
years. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Several Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
10 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue. 
 
In 1998, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but that proceeding was later 
dismissed. In January 1999, she again filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which was also 
dismissed. In 2002, she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a discharge of her 
debts that year. As early as 2004, she was again encountering financial difficulties. A 
judgment was entered against her in 2004 that remains unresolved. She has a long 
history of financial problems that are ongoing. Based on the evidence presented, I 
cannot conclude that her financial problems were long ago, were infrequent, or occurred 
under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Her financial problems continue to cast 
doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does 
not apply. 
 
Applicant attributes many of the delinquent debts to her ex-husband. The 
similarity between her and her ex-husband’s name created confusion. She also claimed 
he used her social security number without her authorization to open accounts. In 2011, 
she was unemployed for about nine months because she did not have a security 
clearance. Her ex-husband’s debts that were attributed to her and her unemployment 
were conditions beyond her control. However, she admitted that she was responsible 
for eleven of the alleged delinquent debts that predated her unemployment in 2011. AG 
¶ 20(b) does not apply to the debts that she admitted.    
 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. She has paid a number of the 
delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.p and 1.v). However, she 
paid six of those debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.v) only days before the 
hearing even though she knew about most of them since her OPM interview in October 
2010. Because of that delay, she failed to establish that she acted in “good-faith” in 
repaying or resolving those debts. Additionally, she presented no meaningful plans for 
resolving the debts in SOR ¶ 1.d and 1.t. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) partially apply. 
 
Applicant claims that a number of the delinquent debts were her ex-husband’s. 
She has disputed those debts through the credit report agencies. Her basis for disputing 
those debts is reasonable and legitimate. AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the disputed debts. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
The security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
11 
 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, 
award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
 In her SCA dated October 24, 2009, Applicant did not disclose that she had a 
judgment entered against her, had debts turned over to collection agencies, and had 
delinquent debts meeting other reporting requirements. At the hearing, she stated that 
she thought the judgment had been discharged in the bankruptcy. She also indicated 
that, when she submitted the SCA, she knew she had debts that were turned over to 
collection agencies and that she had debts that met the reporting requirements. She 
was perplexed that she did not report the debts as required and could not explain her 
responses to the pertinent questions. She denied that she lied or was attempting to hide 
any information in responding to those questions. I found her testimony credible. It was 
apparent that she misinterpreted the questions. Such a misunderstanding does not 
equate to intentional falsifications. AG ¶ 16(a) is not applicable. Personal Conduct 
security concerns are concluded for Applicant. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional

comment. I considered Applicant’s work record and her efforts to resolve her delinquent 
debts. She has a long history of financial problems. Some of her delinquent debts 
remain unresolved, and she presented no realistic plan for resolving them. Questions 
exist whether financial problems will recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under 
Guideline E, but has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F.
