GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 10, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on October 24, 2011.2  On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him a 
set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on October 24, 2011.3  On 
January 13, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to

Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 30, 2012. In a statement, 
notarized February 6, 2012,4 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to 
have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the 
Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on March 12, 
2012, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the 
FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant received the FORM on April 4, 2012, but as of May 23, 2012, he had not 
submitted any further documents or other information. The case was assigned to me on 
May 24, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a principal systems engineer since January 2006. He was previously 
employed as a senior reliability engineer from April 1995 to January 2006.5 Applicant 
served in the U.S. Army for 18 months from June 1970 until December 1971, and 
received an honorable discharge.6 The record is silent regarding Applicant’s 
employment status or activities between 1977 and 1995, but he has apparently held a 
secret security clearance since 1987.7 Applicant attended a university from September 
1973 until December 1977, when he received his bachelor’s degree in an unspecified 
field.8 Applicant was married the first time in August 1975, and divorced in August 1995.

He and his first wife have two children, born in May 1979 and March 1981.9 He married 
his current wife in September 1995.10 He and his wife have three children, born in 
January 1998, December 1999, and October 2002.11 His wife also has a child from her 
first marriage, born in June 1991, residing with the family.12 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial problems, but he 
attributed it to the “downturn in the real estate market and the bad economy.”13 He 
purchased a new home for $392,000, and financed the purchase with an 80 percent first 
mortgage at an interest rate of 7.5 percent, and a 20 percent second mortgage at an 
interest rate of 11.5 percent, all with no money down.14 In order to install a swimming 
pool, he obtained a third mortgage.15 The total amount financed for the three mortgages 
was $450,000.16 Applicant’s monthly payment for the combined mortgages was 
$3,650.17  
 
At some unspecified point, Applicant felt “stuck” because he wanted to be in a 
position to retire in three and one-half years. However, because the value of the home 
had decreased to $220,000, he had no equity in the home.18 Applicant acknowledged 
that he had the ability to continue making his monthly mortgage payments.19 He sought 
professional guidance from two bankruptcy attorneys, and they advised him that he 
earned too much money to qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and that a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy would cost him $7,600 per month in mortgage payments over a period of 
five years.20 The alternative was what he selected: a strategic default to lower both the 
principle owed the mortgage lenders and the monthly payments, because simply 
lowering the monthly payments would not build equity in the house.21 Accordingly,

Applicant stopped making monthly payments on the first two mortgages in July 2010.22 
The first two mortgages were transferred to a mortgage servicing company, and 
Applicant started working with that company. Applicant’s position is that if the principal 
for the first two mortgages is not reduced, he will let the property go into foreclosure.23  
 
The SOR identified four continuing delinquencies. One of those accounts (SOR ¶ 
1.a.) is a 120 day delinquency of $12,167 on the first mortgage loan with a balance of 
$300,087.24 At some point after December 2010, Applicant was notified by the mortgage 
servicing company that he did not qualify for a loan modification through the Federal 
Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), and the home was placed in a 
foreclosure status.25 In September 2011, the first mortgage was in foreclosure.26 
Another account (SOR ¶ 1.b.) is the second mortgage loan with a balance of $110,537 
that was past due approximately $3,337.27 In October 2011, the second mortgage was 
in foreclosure.28 The third account (SOR ¶ 1.c.) is the third mortgage loan with a 
balance of $47,619 that is also in foreclosure.29 Applicant had stopped making monthly 
payments on his third mortgage in about May 2011.30  
 
Another account (SOR ¶ 1.d.), completely separate from the home mortgages, 
was a loan for a motor home that was purchased for an estimated $99,000 in 2004.31 
Although Applicant still owed between $78,000 and $87,000 on the loan, he managed to 
sell it at a “short sale” for between $42,000 and $43,000, with the purchaser paying 
$25,000, and Applicant paying the difference.32 Applicant contended he borrowed 
$18,009 from his 401(k) to pay the bank to satisfy the remaining portion of the debt.33 In 
May 2010, the remaining $35,209.67 debt was cancelled and Applicant was issued a 
Form 1099-C.34

As of December 2010, Applicant earned an annual salary of $117,000, while his 
wife, also an employee of the same company, had an annual salary of $65,000.35 He 
contended he made enough money to pay his debts and remain current on all other 
financial obligations.36 He also indicated he was paying off all the accounts that he 
intended to resolve in bankruptcy, including credit card accounts, car loans, and student 
loans, but did not explain what his repayment arrangements might be. Furthermore, 
Applicant submitted no documentation to support his contentions. Considering the 
continuing presence of the three foreclosed mortgages, and the absence of more 
specific financial information, there are no indications that Applicant’s financial problems 
are being resolved or are under control. 
 
Applicant stated he had received unspecified financial “advice” regarding the 
actions taken by him, but the record is silent regarding any financial counseling 
pertaining to money management, debt consolidation, or repayment plans.  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”37 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”38   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”41 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”42 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial “problems” commenced at an unspecified time 
between 2007 and 2010, when Applicant decided to intentionally stop making the 
monthly payments on the mortgages on his residence because the value of his property 
had decreased by about 50 per cent and he no longer had equity in the property. While 
he maintained that he had the money to continue making his monthly mortgage 
payments, Applicant instead chose to make a strategic default on his mortgage loans to 
force the mortgage lenders to lower both the principal owed and the monthly payments. 
Mortgages and other accounts became delinquent, and his mortgages went into a 
foreclosure status. Although he had a combined family annual income of $182,000 in 
December 2010, his financial difficulties remain unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) 
apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@43  
                                                          
43
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of 
Applicant’s continuing financial “problems” make it difficult to conclude that it occurred 
“so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant attributed his financial “problems” to the 
“downturn in the real estate market and the bad economy.”  It is true that the national 
economic conditions, including the devastated housing market, were unexpected and 
beyond Applicant’s control. However, the degree to which those factors had an impact 
on Applicant’s ability to overcome them has not been explained. Applicant was unhappy 
that his residence had depreciated in value, and he no longer had any equity in it. He 
admittedly had sufficient funds to continue making his monthly mortgage payments, but 
he felt that to do so might negatively impact his ability to retire on schedule as he had 
planned. Instead, Applicant considered the possible bankruptcy options,44 but decided 
to intentionally stop making the monthly payments, supposedly to qualify for mortgage 
modifications under HAMP. But Applicant’s applications were denied, and foreclosure 
proceedings were commenced by the mortgage lenders. Applicant has not acted 
responsibly under the circumstances, and his actions cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.45 
 
AG & 20(c) only minimally applies. Applicant claimed he had received 
unspecified financial “advice” regarding the actions eventually taken by him, but the 
record is silent regarding any financial counseling pertaining to money management, 
debt consolidation, or repayment plans. Moreover, while the mortgages remain in 
foreclosure, there are no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.  
 
AG & 20(d) only partially applies. Applicant did address his delinquent motor 
home account. Although he still owed between $78,000 and $87,000 on the loan, he 
managed to sell it at a short sale for between $42,000 and $43,000, with the purchaser 
paying $25,000, and Applicant purportedly paying the difference. However, in May 
2010, the remaining $35,209.67 debt was cancelled and Applicant was issued a Form 
1099-C. By making cold financial decisions related to his three home mortgages and his 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

44
 In this regard, Department Counsel makes an interesting observation regarding the bankruptcy options. 
“[o]ne of the primary purposes of [bankruptcy] is to ‘relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive 
indebtedness, and permit him to start afresh from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business 
misfortunes.” Local Loan v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). Applicant’s sole purpose was simply to avoid paying his 
mortgages by dishonoring his obligations which imposed losses on his creditors.

motor home, especially when he had the financial ability to continue making his monthly 
payments, Applicant has not shown reasonableness, prudence, honesty, or adherence 
to duty or obligation.46 The evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant acted 
responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.47       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He has been 
employed by the same company for approximately ten years and honorably served in 
the U.S. military. He sought mortgage modifications from his three mortgage lenders 
and sold his motor home at a short sale.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:48 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to

implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There are some questionable actions by Applicant in handling his delinquent accounts. 
Although he had sufficient funds to continue making his monthly mortgage payments, 
Applicant made a decision to stop paying his monthly mortgage payments in an effort to 
force the mortgage lenders to comply with his wishes to lower his monthly payments and 
otherwise modify all of the mortgages. As a result, he permitted three mortgages to fall 
into arrears and become delinquent. They are now in foreclosure. His motor home loan 
was partially resolved in a short sale, and $35,209.67 of the debt was cancelled by the 
lender. I conclude that Applicant has failed to establish a meaningful track record of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.  
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
     
  
 
11 
                                      
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
