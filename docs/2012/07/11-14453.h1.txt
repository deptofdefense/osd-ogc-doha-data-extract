LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 12, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline 
F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2012, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2012. DOHA issued 
a notice of hearing on June 4, 2012, scheduling the hearing for June 21, 2012. The 
hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were 
 
2 
 
admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through L, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for 
Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant timely submitted documents that 
were marked AE M through S and admitted without objection. DOHA received the 
hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 28, 2012.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since 2003. He served in the U.S. military from 1988 until he was 
honorably discharged in 1992. He seeks to retain his security clearance, which he has 
held for at least eight years. He attended college for a period but did not obtain a 
degree. He is married with four children, ages 20, 16, 10, and 6.1 
  
 Applicant’s wife lost her job in 2006 and was unemployed for about six months. 
He was unable to pay all his bills and several debts became delinquent. Applicant and 
his wife share the responsibility of handling the family finances. He did not monitor his 
finances close enough. He initially denied owing several debts that he later realized 
were his responsibility.2  
 
 The SOR alleges four delinquent debts with balances totaling about $27,700 and 
a past-due $22,023 second mortgage. Applicant denied all the allegations in his 
response to the SOR. He also provided reasons for his denials. Individual debts are 
discussed below.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a $12,524 delinquent debt to a collection company on behalf 
of a bank. A 2004 credit report shows a current account with the bank that was opened 
in 2001, with a $4,621 balance. A 2011 credit report shows a collection account that 
was opened in June 2008 with a $12,524 balance. Applicant initially denied 
responsibility for the debt. He stated that he had several accounts with the bank, but he 
thought they had been paid. On July 19, 2012, Applicant and the collection company 
agreed to settle the debt, which had a balance of $12,584, for $3,750, payable through 
a $3,000 payment and seven monthly payments of $107. Applicant established that he 
made the initial $3,000 payment.3  
 
 In February 2012, Applicant and the collection company handling the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b agreed to settle the debt, which had a balance of $9,861, for 
$1,999. The settlement payments were completed on March 30, 2012.4

 Applicant and the collection company handling the $2,952 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.c agreed in February 2012 to settle the debt for $800. The settlement payments were 
completed on April 3, 2012.5 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d. alleges a past-due $22,023 second mortgage loan. Applicant credibly 
denied ever having a second mortgage loan with the named creditor. He bought a 
house in the 1990s for about $64,000. A May 2004 Experian credit report shows a paid 
and closed mortgage loan that was opened in 1994, with a credit limit of $66,800. That 
report also shows a mortgage loan that was opened in November 2002 for $80,000, 
with a $79,473 balance. The report does not show a second mortgage loan. Applicant 
sold the house in August 2004 for $102,000. The settlement statement shows that 
Applicant’s mortgage loan was paid when the house sale closed. There is no mention of 
a second mortgage loan. 
 
 A September 2011 Experian credit report shows a second mortgage loan that 
was opened in November 2001 for $20,000, with a date of last action of June 2007. The 
report lists it as $20,091 past due, with a balance of $15,781. Equifax credit reports from 
February and June 2012 list a delinquent second mortgage loan with a different bank. 
Those reports show the mortgage loan as opened in November 2001 and a date of last 
action of July 2007. The balance is listed as $22,023 in February and $23,000 in June 
2012. Applicant contacted the bank in April 2012 seeking information about the second 
mortgage loan. The bank sent him a letter dated April 11, 2012, stating that it was 
investigating the matter, and that it would provide him a response in a timely manner. 
Applicant did not hear back from the bank. He sent another letter on July 18, 2012.6 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a $2,421 delinquent debt to a collection company on behalf of 
a bank. A 2004 credit report shows a current account with the bank that was opened in 
1992, with a $2,076 balance. A 2011 credit report shows a collection account with a 
$2,421 balance. Applicant initially denied responsibility for the debt, stating that he did 
not recall having an account with the bank. On July 2, 2012, Applicant and the collection 
company agreed to settle the debt, which had a balance of $4,485, for $1,189. Applicant 
paid the $1,189 settlement amount on July 12, 2012.7 
 
 Applicant retained a law firm specializing in credit repair, but he has not received 
formal financial counseling. Applicant was on strike for about seven weeks. He returned 
to work the week before the hearing. He has a child in college, and his finances were 
tight while he was on strike. He is back to work, and his wife works a full-time job. He is 
able to pay his current bills with some left over for savings and emergencies, and he is 
not accumulating new delinquent debt.8

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
 
6 
 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
  Applicant provided sufficient evidence to question the validity of the second 
mortgage loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to the that debt. 
 
  Applicant’s wife was unemployed for about six months in 2006. That was beyond 
his control. AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the 
circumstances.  
 
  Applicant lost control of his finances. He initially denied owing all the debts in the 
SOR. I found him to be open and credible about his finances. I am convinced his 
denials were not attempts to conceal his problems, but were indicative of his failure to 
have a firm grasp on his finances. He entered into settlement agreements with two of 
the creditors in February 2012, and the remaining two creditors after his hearing. The 
settlement payments were completed on three of the debts. He paid $3,000 toward the 
settlement of the fourth debt, but he still owes $750, payable in $107 monthly 
installments. I am satisfied that he will maintain those payments. Applicant is back to 
work after being on strike for seven weeks, and his wife works a full-time job. He is now 
in the position where he can pay his current bills, and he has a positive cash flow that 
can be used for savings and emergencies.  
 
 Applicant has not received formal financial counseling, but there are clear 
indications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. They 
occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG ¶ 20(c) is applicable. AG ¶¶ 
20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) have minimal applicability because all of the debts were settled 
recently for less than what was owed, and settlement agreements on two of the debts 
were not reached until after the hearing.10   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
                                                          
10 The Appeal Board addressed debt settlement in ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010): 
 
Applicant’s attempts to settle outstanding debts at a reduced amount speaks directly to 
an evaluation of the good faith nature of Applicant’s effort to reduce indebtedness 
responsibly, given the record evidence of the fact that she had funds available to fully 
satisfy these debts, and the fact that Applicant’s attempts to settle the debts for a lesser 
amount resulted in their going unpaid. 
 
 
7 
 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
I considered Applicant’s honorable military service. I found him to be honest and 
candid about his finances. He should have been more proactive about his finances and 
taken action sooner than he did. I am satisfied that he has learned from the process and 
those mistakes will not be repeated.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated financial considerations concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
