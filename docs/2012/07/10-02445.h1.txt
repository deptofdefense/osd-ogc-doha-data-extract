TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 20 delinquent debts, totaling 
$62,988. He mitigated one $72 debt. He did not provide documentary evidence of any 
payments to the SOR creditors. Financial considerations are not mitigated. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 2, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On August 10, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant, and it

recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination 
whether his clearance should be continued or revoked.  
 
On December 12, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. On January 4, 2012, Department Counsel was ready to proceed on Applicant’s 
case. On January 10, 2012, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to an administrative 
judge. On March 28, 2012, Applicant’s case was transferred to me for administrative 
reasons. On April 17, 2012, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for May 
16, 2012. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant offered three exhibits. (Tr. 12-17; GE 1-5; 
AE A-C) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-C. (Tr. 16, 17) On 
May 31, 2012, I received the transcript of the hearing. I held the record open until May 
31, 2012, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation. (Tr. 68, 71-74) 
Applicant did not provide any post-hearing evidence.

section of Section 26 that he did not have a credit report, and he had retained a credit 
repair firm to help him correct his credit report. (GE 1) He believed his finances would 
be “squared away in less than six months.” (GE 1) 
 
Applicant’s credit reports, SOR, and January 19, 2010 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview allege 20 delinquent debts, totaling 
$62,988. Applicant provided the following status for his 20 SOR debts: 
 
1.a is a medical debt for $612—UNRESOLVED. Applicant’s medical bills are 
covered by TRICARE and a private insurance company. (Tr. 50-53) He disputes his 
responsibility for medical bills resulting from the treatment of his foot. (Tr. 50-53) He 
believes that TRICARE or his insurance should pay this debt. (Tr. 50-53)   
 
1.b is a debt for an apartment lease for $2,650—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said 
that he believed that credit counseling and debt resolution service (CCDRS) paid this 
debt. (Tr. 53-54)   
 
1.c is a debt owed to a power company for $150—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said 
this debt was from the utilities for his spouse’s apartment. (Tr. 46-47) His SOR response 
indicates this debt is paid. If this debt is not resolved, he intends to pay or settle it. (Tr. 
54-55)  
 
1.d and 1.e are debts owed to a credit union for $283 and $4,803—
UNRESOLVED. Applicant believes that CCDRS is in the process of resolving or has 
resolved these two debts. (Tr. 55)   
 
1.f is a debt for $8,889—UNRESOLVED. This debt has been delinquent for 
several years. (Tr. 57) Applicant has not made any payments; however, either he or 
CCDRS is in the process of resolving it. (Tr. 57) 
 
1.g and 1.h are debts to the same bank for $2,514 and $1,705—UNRESOLVED. 
Applicant or CCDRS are in the process of attempting to settle these two debts. (Tr. 57-
58)   
 
1.i is a collection debt for $475 for a telecommunications account—
UNRESOLVED. Applicant said this debt has been settled. (Tr. 58)   
 
1.j, 1.k, and 1.l are three collection debt originating from the same credit union for 
$3,807; $11,505; and $18,518—UNRESOLVED. The $3,807 debt is for a credit card; 
the $11,505 debt is for his first spouse’s vehicle; and the $18,518 is for a debt 
consolidation loan. (Tr. 58-62) He said he is in the process of settling these three debts. 
(Tr. 62)  
 
1.m is a power company debt for $210—UNRESOLVED. Applicant’s SOR 
response indicates this debt is paid. He said he paid it around 2010. (Tr. 47-49)  
 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
1.n is a debt owed to Defense Finance for $542—RESOLVED. Applicant’s SOR 
response indicates this debt is paid. He said it was paid from his tax refund in 2005. (Tr. 
48-49)   
 
1.o is a debt from the purchase of furniture for $72—RESOLVED. Applicant said 
it was settled more than 10 years ago. (Tr. 62) This debt is so old and of such minimal 
amount, it is unreasonable to require Applicant to produce corroborating documentation 
showing it has been resolved.   
 
1.p is a collection debt for $600; 1.q is a debt for $819; 1.r is a collection debt for 
$132; and 1.s is a telecommunications debt for $586—UNRESOLVED. Applicant’s SOR 
response indicates the SOR ¶ 1.r debt is paid. Applicant said these four debts were 
settled. (Tr. 62) 
 
1.t is a debt for $4,116—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said CCDRS is attempting to 
resolve this debt. (Tr. 62-63) 
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his two divorces, unemployment for 
about two months after he left active duty in November 2005, supporting his sister, and 
his mother’s funeral expenses. (Tr. 29-34) He was deployed to Kuwait, Haiti, Iraq, and 
Bahrain on behalf of his defense-contractor employer. (Tr. 35) 
 
In 2010 with bonuses and salary, Applicant earned $70,000. (Tr. 37) After 
deducting taxes and child support, Applicant’s net monthly income is about $3,000. (Tr. 
37) He has a monthly vehicle payment of $544 for a 2006 BMW LR he purchased in 
2009 for $32,000. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant received credit counseling. (Tr. 43)  
 
In June 2011, CCDRS began working with Applicant to resolve his debts. (Tr. 44) 
On January 19, 2012, CCDRS wrote that CCDRS started working with Applicant on 
June 6, 2011, and expected to have incorrect issues on his credit reports corrected in 
seven to eight months. (AE A) CCDRS did not provide any information about paying or 
settling any of the SOR debts. (AE A) Applicant estimated that he paid a total of $600 to 
$700 to CCDRS in the previous year. (Tr. 45, 56) 
 
In 2011 when he was deployed to Iraq, he earned $165,000 to $175,000; 
however, after paying taxes he only received $140,000. (Tr. 38, 64) Aside from his SOR 
debts, all of Applicant’s other bills are current. (Tr. 64) He has about $13,000 in a 
401(K) account; and about $1,000 in the bank. (Tr. 41, 69) 
 
I explained to Applicant that he needed to provide documentary corroboration of 
his statements that he had paid or resolved or was resolving his delinquent SOR debts. 
(Tr. 65-74) I suggested he obtain and provide a status report from CCDRS showing 
funds received, funds disbursed, and debts resolved. I suggested that he provide 
character references, evaluations, and his DD Form 214. (Tr. 70-71) He did not provide 
any of the suggested documentation after his hearing.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM interview, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
Many of Applicant’s debts became delinquent at least two years ago. His SOR 
alleges 20 delinquent debts, totaling $62,988. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to all of Applicant’s SOR debts. 
Applicant has found it very difficult to obtain corroborating documentary evidence for the 
$72 debt in SOR ¶ 1.o because it is more than ten years old. Applicant is credited with 
mitigating his Defense Finance debt for $542 in SOR ¶ 1.n because he indicated it was 
paid through a collection from Applicant’s federal tax refund.2 It is not unusual for 
Defense Finance debts to be resolved through this mechanism. Applicant received 
financial counseling. He understands how to establish his financial responsibility and 
eliminate delinquent debt.  
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his two divorces, unemployment for 
about two months after he left active duty in November 2005, supporting his sister, and 
his mother’s funeral expenses of about $7,000. His deployments to Kuwait, Haiti, Iraq, 
and Bahrain on behalf of his defense-contractor employer made it more difficult for him 
to contact and pay his creditors. These were circumstances largely beyond Applicant’s 
control.  
 
Applicant did not establish that he acted in good faith to resolve 18 of his 
delinquent SOR debts totaling $62,374.3 He earned approximately $170,000 in 2011.

See ISCR Case No. 08-06059 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009) (indicating involuntary payment of 
debts through garnishment is not necessarily mitigating). 
   
3
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
He had the means to make substantial progress resolving his delinquent SOR debts. He 
did not prove that he maintained contact with most of his SOR creditors,4 and he did not 
prove that he made sufficient attempts to establish payment plans or otherwise resolve 
his SOR debts. He did not establish “there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control.” He did not prove that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. Once he learned of the delinquent debts, he failed to take reasonable 
action in a timely fashion to resolve his delinquent SOR debts.   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not fully applicable. Applicant said he was disputing the medical 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $612, asserting it was the responsibility of TRICARE and a private 
insurance company. Applicant did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the 
basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”   
 
Applicant has not provided enough evidence to establish that his delinquent debt 
is unlikely to recur. His track record of financial responsibility shows insufficient effort, 
good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of financial 
considerations concerns. It is likely that financial problems will continue.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. Applicant is a 33-year-old field support 
(generator) technician for a defense contractor, who has worked for the same employer 
since July 2009. He is a high school graduate with approximately six college credits. He 
was on active duty in the Navy from September 1996 to October 2005, with service in 
Japan for three years and Bahrain for one year. He received an honorable discharge 
from the Navy. He has held an interim clearance since October 2009, and there were no 
allegations of security violations. Since 2001, Applicant has been divorced twice and is 
separated from his third spouse. He has an eight-year-old son and he is current on his 
child support. His mother died in March 2010, and Applicant became responsible for his 
sister. He paid for his mother’s funeral, which cost more than $7,000. His deployments 
to Kuwait, Haiti, Iraq, and Bahrain on behalf of his defense-contractor employer made it 
more difficult for him to contact and pay his creditors. Circumstances largely beyond 
Applicant’s control adversely affected his finances. He had financial counseling, and he 
is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He is 
an asset to his company and his family. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering 
to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a defense contractor and for his 
years of active duty Navy service. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United 
States and his employer. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. He is an intelligent person, and he had about $170,000 in gross 
income in 2011. He had the ability and resources to make greater progress resolving 18 
SOR debts totaling $62,374. It was unreasonable for Applicant to conclude that paying 
$600 to $700 to CCDRS in the previous year would result in a substantial reduction in 
his delinquent debts. There are not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control.” He did not prove that he acted responsibly with respect to his debts 
under the circumstances. Financial considerations security concerns are not fully 
mitigated at this time.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not fully mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.m:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.n and 1.o:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p to 1.t:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
