Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems (failure to file federal income tax returns, back taxes owed
to the IRS, and delinquent debts) that is ongoing. Applicant failed to present sufficient
evidence to overcome the security concerns stemming from his problematic financial
history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about March1
26, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the
security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took
place July 10, 2012. The transcript (Tr.) was received July 26, 2012.  
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged unfavorable financial matters as follows: (1) failure to file
federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009; and (2) seven delinquent
debts (collection or charged-off accounts) in amounts ranging from $187 to $3,205 for a
total of about $6,000. Applicant admitted these allegations in his answer to the SOR.
His admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In
addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking a
security clearance for the first time for his job as an electrician at a U.S. Air Force base.
He began this job in December 2009. His gross income for 2010 was about $61,000,
and for 2011 it was about $64,000.  Applicant’s electrical shop superintendent provided2
a highly favorable letter of recommendation.  The letter describes Applicant as an3
honest and well-rounded employee who possesses a good attitude and unquestionable
integrity. Applicant describes his job as a great experience and an opportunity to serve
his country.  4
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. He
failed to file federal income tax returns for 2006–2009 due to youth, inexperience,

immaturity, and procrastination.   At the hearing, he produced documentary information5
from the IRS that he has now filed returns for 2006–2010.  He also admitted that he did6
not file a federal income tax return for 2011, and he did not file an application for an
automatic extension of time to file the return.  He estimated that he owes the IRS about7
$5,000 to $8,000 in back taxes.  His intent is to repay the back taxes by entering into an8
installment repayment agreement with the IRS. 
Applicant’s attributes the $6,000 in delinquent debts to irresponsibility on his
part.  In his answer to the SOR, he explained that he entered into a debt-relief program9
with the goal of settling the unsecured debts. Based on the documentation produced at
the hearing, he entered into this program in 2011, the program included all seven
delinquent debts in the SOR, and he made a payment of about $480 in December
2011.  He claims he made five payments into the plan, but he produced no paperwork10
to support his claim. Further, his testimony about his payment record was confusing.11
Sometime in early 2012, he put the program on hold in light of his uncertainty
surrounding the pending security clearance case.12
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As13
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt14
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

4
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An15
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  16
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting17
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An18
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate19
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme20
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it23
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant24
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline25
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  26
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Standing alone, Applicant’s neglect of his federal income tax
obligations raises serious security concerns.  It should be obvious, but it is nonetheless27
stated here, that any applicant who is unwilling or unable to fulfill their federal income
tax obligations is not a good candidate for a security clearance, which is a privilege
granted by the federal government. Overall, Applicant’s unfavorable financial history
indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting28
financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to29
establish these two disqualifying conditions, and the facts also suggest a degree of
financial irresponsibility.
 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a30
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;30
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have considered all the mitigating conditions, and none, individually or in
combination, is sufficient to overcome and mitigate the security concerns stemming
from Applicant’s problematic financial history, which is ongoing. For reasons that are
perhaps understandable but nonetheless inexcusable, Applicant fell behind on his
federal income tax obligations by failing to file returns for 2006–2009, a period of four
tax years. To his credit, he has now filed returns for those years and for 2010. But he
failed to timely file a return for 2011, and he has not requested an extension of time to
do so. He owes the IRS an undetermined amount of back taxes and there is no
repayment plan in place. In light of these circumstances, it is simply too soon to tell if
Applicant’s federal income tax problems are safely in the past or will continue to recur. 
In addition to the federal tax problems, he failed to adhere to and follow through
on the debt-relief program. As a result, those seven unsecured delinquent debts remain
unresolved.

Applicant’s history of financial problems is both longstanding and ongoing. Based
on the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that Applicant has clearly and
convincingly committed to cleaning up his financial house and then living a financially-
responsible lifestyle. Until he does so, he is not a good candidate for a security
clearance to work in the defense industry.  
The evidence of Applicant’s ongoing financial problems justifies current doubts
about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-
consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  In particular, I gave Applicant credit for his31
good employment record and his efforts to address his financial problems. Although
these matters weigh in his favor, they are not enough to mitigate and overcome the
security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a
favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.h: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
