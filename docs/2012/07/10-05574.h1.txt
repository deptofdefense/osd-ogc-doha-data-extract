GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 21, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on January 25, 2012.2 On February 24, 2012, DOHA issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline 
E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 7, 2012. In a sworn written 
statement, dated April 9, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on May 7, 2012, and the case was assigned to 
me on May 11, 2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 17, 2012, but because 
Applicant had recently engaged the services of Ms. Gordon, upon her motion for a 
continuance, and there being no objection to said motion by Department Counsel, on 
May 25, 2012, I granted the motion and rescheduled the hearing for June 19, 2012. 
However, due to Applicant’s previously scheduled mission responsibilities overseas, 
another motion for a continuance was made on May 29, 2012. There being no objection 
to said motion by Department Counsel, on June 4, 2012, I granted the motion and 
rescheduled the hearing for June 27, 2012. I convened the hearing, as scheduled.  
 
 During the hearing, 11 Government exhibits (GE 1-11) and 27 Applicant exhibits 
(AE A-AA) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one other 
witness testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on July 9, 2012. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 On April 25, 2012, nearly two weeks after Applicant responded to the SOR, 
Department Counsel amended the SOR without offering any explanation for the action.3 
At the commencement of the hearing, I handled the action as a motion to amend4 and 
reviewed the proposal with both parties. Specifically, Department Counsel moved to 
withdraw SOR & 1.d., and && 2.a. through 2.f. There being no objection, the motion was 
granted.5 Accordingly, the SOR allegations pertaining to Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) were withdrawn and are no longer a security concern.

 Department Counsel cited & E.3.1.13 of the Directive as authority for the amendment : “As far in advance 
as practical, Department Counsel and the applicant shall serve one another with a copy of any pleading, proposed 
documentary evidence, or other written communication to be submitted to the Administrative Judge.” 
 
4
 & E.3.1.17 states: “The SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his or her 
own motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it in conformity with the 
evidence admitted or for other good cause. . . .”

Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but two of the factual allegations 
pertaining to criminal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.) of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the two remaining allegations.6 After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a program analyst.7 In his SF 86, Applicant indicated he was granted access to 
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in March 2005,8 but during the hearing he 
stated he was granted a top secret security clearance in December 2006, with no 
mention of the SCI.9 He subsequently lost his security clearance, but regained it in July 
2009, and currently holds a top secret security clearance.10  
 
Following his high school graduation in May 2001, Applicant attended a 
community college for an unspecified number of years, but did not receive a degree.11 
He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in July 2001, and served 
honorably until July 2006, when he separated as a corporal.12 During his military career, 
Applicant was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (with gold star), 
the USMC Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the 
National Defense Service Medal, the Rifle Qualification Badge (Expert), and the Pistol 
Qualification Badge (Expert).13 He also received accolades for outstanding 
achievement.14 
 
Since separating from active duty, Applicant has held several positions with 
different organizations. He was a senior training specialist from July 2006 until October 
2007, and a project officer from October 2007 until December 2008.15 He joined his 
current employer in December 2008.16 Applicant has never been married.17

Criminal Conduct 
Applicant has a history of diverse criminal conduct that commenced in 2002 while 
he was on active duty and resumed in 2009. In May 2002, when he was about 18 or 19 
years old, Applicant used marijuana on one occasion.18 During the period March 2002 
until July 2002, Applicant used methamphetamine between 12 and 15 occasions at 
parties with friends.19 He has not used any illegal drugs since July 2002.20 In July 2002, 
while sitting in a car with a friend, Applicant was found to be illegally carrying what was 
described as a concealed weapon under state law: a wooden handled knife that had a 
total length of about eight inches and a blade length of about four and one-half inches.21 
At that time, although Applicant claimed to be on authorized leave,22 he was arrested by 
local law enforcement authorities and held in the city jail, followed by the county jail, and 
then returned to military custody, for possession of the knife and for being absent 
without leave from his detachment for eight days.23  
As a result of the above alleged misconduct, Applicant was charged with 
violations of Article 86 (10 U.S.C. ' 886) (absence without leave), Uniform Code of 
Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 112a (10 U.S.C. ' 912a) (wrongful use of controlled 
substances), UCMJ, and Article 134 (10 U.S.C. ' 934) (general article), UCMJ, and 
referred to a special court-martial.24 The charge and specification for violation of Article 
86 was dismissed or withdrawn for unspecified reasons, although Applicant contends it 
was because he was actually on authorized leave.25 In December 2002, Applicant 
entered a plea of guilty to the two remaining charges and three specifications: wrongful

 GE 6, supra note 23; GE 9 (Commander’s Report of Disciplinary or Administrative Action, dated January 
4, 2003). The accuracy of several of the Government exhibits is questionable due to the numerous inconsistencies 
appearing in them. For example, Government Exhibit 9 lists three offenses on the first page: absent without leave, 
wrongful possession of methamphetamine, and wrongful use of amphetamine, with no mention of unlawfully carrying 
a concealed weapon, but on the reverse side, lists four offenses: unauthorized absence, wrongful use of 
methamphetamine, wrongful use of marijuana, and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon. The charges were 
referred to a special court-martial. Government Exhibit 6, on the other hand, lists the following offenses: unauthorized 
absence, wrongful use of methamphetamine, wrongful use of amphetamine, and wrongful use of marijuana, with no 
mention of unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon, and adding the offense of wrongful use of amphetamine. 
Furthermore, the type of court-martial is reflected as a summary court-martial, not a special court-martial. The 
Government did not offer a Charge Sheet (DD Form 458) to verify the charges and specifications.

use of methamphetamine, wrongful use of marijuana, and unlawfully carrying a 
concealed weapon.26 The military judge found Applicant guilty, and sentenced him to be 
reduced to pay grade E-1, to forfeit $725.00 pay per month for two months, to be 
confined for a period of 60 days, and to be discharged with a bad-conduct discharge 
(BCD).27  The commanding general approved all but that portion of the sentence that 
called for the BCD and confinement for more than 30 days.28 Accordingly, those 
allegations of SOR && 1.b. and 1.b(1) that refer to wrongful use of amphetamine or 
forfeiture of $700 per month for two months have not been established. The remaining 
allegations in SOR && 1.b., 1.b(1), and 1.b(2) have been established. 
In June 2002, a Marine friend gave Applicant $470.25 and her automobile to 
have the vehicle’s rear bumper repaired by a local mechanic he knew.29 While the 
vehicle was at the mechanic’s residence and workplace, an unlicensed resident of the 
house took the car for a test drive, but was pulled over by police because of the missing 
rear bumper. The vehicle was impounded.30 Those actions apparently resulted in 
charges being filed against Applicant. The SOR alleged that in 2002, Applicant was tried 
by special court-martial for two violations of Article 121 (10 U.S.C. ' 921) (larceny of 
private funds – over $100, and larceny of a private vehicle), UCMJ. He was purportedly 
found guilty and sentenced to be reduced to pay grade E-1, to forfeit $700.00 pay per 
month for two months, to be confined for a period of one month, and to be discharged 
with a BCD.31 Applicant denied the convictions and contended the charges were 
withdrawn.32  
 
The Government produced some evidence regarding the existence of the 
charges and the unverified resultant sentences, punishments, or administrative action. 
However, there is noticeably missing a DD Form 458 or a special court-martial order 
confirming a court-martial, a sentence, or an approved action. Under the Rules for 
Courts-Martial (R.C.M.), Rule 307(c)(4) , “charges and specifications alleging all known 
offenses by an accused may be preferred at the same time.” (emphasis added). 
Furthermore, in the discussion section of R.C.M. Rule 601(e)(1), “ordinarily all known

 GE 10, supra note 26, at 2. GE 9 is again inaccurate regarding “resultant sentences, punishments, or 
administrative action.” It reflects a reprimand, a written admonition, a fine of $700 for two months, reduction to E-1, 
confinement for two months, and a BCD. Nowhere in the special court-martial order are there any references to a 
reprimand, a written admonition, or a fine of $700 for two months. GE 6 referred to the $700 per month forfeiture.

 Applicant’s version of the facts differed from those of the vehicle owner. He claimed the vehicle owner and 
he both went to the mechanic’s residence. See GE 8, supra note 19, at 8.

charges should be referred to a single court-martial.” (emphasis added). Considering 
the R.C.M., Applicant’s denial of a separate special court-martial during the same time-
frame as the initial one, the suspect sentence, the absence of meaningful direct 
evidence of the second conviction, and Applicant’s Good Conduct Medal period which 
commenced December 18, 2002,33 I conclude that the allegations in SOR & 1.c. have 
not been established. 
 
In May 2009, Applicant returned to the United States from an overseas 
assignment and contacted a female acquaintance he had previously met on line and 
dated a few times.34 Although he had been awake for approximately 40 hours,35 they 
spent the day together shopping, doing his laundry, preparing dinner, consuming a “fair 
amount of alcohol,” and watching a movie.36 After consuming beer and wine, Applicant 
turned to “hard alcohol.”37 Applicant’s acquaintance described him as definitely 
intoxicated.38 As the evening wore on, the atmosphere changed. Applicant started to act 
in a bizarre, agitated manner, initially sitting with a dazed look, glaring straight ahead, 
rocking back and forth, and then grabbing several knives to defend against someone or 
something.39 Applicant never thrust the knives at his acquaintance and never held them 
against any part of her body.40 They entered her automobile, and he directed her to 
drive. She managed to run from the car at a stop sign and ran to a police officer.41 
Applicant remembered nothing about the events of the evening.42 
 
Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) abduction by force or intimidation, a 
felony; (2) intentional destruction of property less than $1,000, a felony; (3) aggravated 
sexual battery by force or with a weapon, a felony; and (4) assault, a misdemeanor.43 
Applicant also admitted he had been charged with public intoxication.44 Under a plea 
agreement,45 in June 2009, he pleaded no contest to the public intoxication charge and

was fined $100 and ordered to pay $71 in court costs.46 The charges for intentional 
destruction of property less than $1,000; aggravated sexual battery by force or with a 
weapon; and assault, were nolle prosequi in September 2009.47 The remaining charge, 
abduction by force or intimidation, was reduced to attempted unlawful wounding.48 In 
March 2010, Applicant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and was sentenced to be 
incarcerated for five years, suspended on condition of good behavior, and placed on 
supervised probation for five years unless sooner released.49 Applicant’s probation will 
expire in June 2015, but he will be eligible for early release after he has completed one-
half of the entire probation.50 He has not yet reached the halfway point, which was 
calculated as December 2012.51 
 
In an effort to deal with, and confront, the issues that have resulted in his 
conduct, Applicant has done an assessment of his life and other factors. He has 
undergone two mental health evaluations, and has made changes to his personal 
habits, including getting more rest and stopping consuming alcohol. He has developed a 
support group.52 He has also developed a totally different perspective as a result of his 
realization of how his actions affect other individuals.53 
 
Work Performance and Character References 
 
The most recent overall summary of Applicant’s work performance has been 
characterized as successful, although various success factors have been rated 
exceptional or excellent.54 The executive director of the office for whom Applicant 
provides “mission critical support,” a lieutenant general who is the commander of a U.S. 
Army command, a rear admiral who is the deputy commander of a joint command, and 
a patrol agent in charge with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have all 
effusively praised Applicant’s outstanding and exceptional service and performance, 
unparalleled ingenuity, impressive and extraordinary knowledge, dedication, and 
professionalism. He has been described a nothing short of a “National Treasure.”55

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”56 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”57   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”58 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.59

A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”60 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”61 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern under the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 
30:       
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 31(a), “a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 31(d), if “the individual is currently on parole or 
probation,” security concerns may be raised. As noted above, in 2002, when he was 
about 18 or 19 years old, Applicant was convicted in a special court-martial of wrongful 
use of methamphetamine, wrongful use of marijuana, and unlawfully carrying a 
concealed weapon. The military judge sentenced Applicant to be reduced to pay grade 
E-1, to forfeit $725.00 pay per month for two months, to be confined for a period of 60 
days, and to be discharged with a BCD.  The commanding general approved all but that 
portion of the sentence that called for the BCD and confinement for more than 30 days.

In 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with abduction by force or 
intimidation; intentional destruction of property less than $1,000; aggravated sexual 
battery by force or with a weapon; assault; and public intoxication. Under a plea 
agreement, he pleaded no contest to the public intoxication charge and was fined. The 
charges for intentional destruction of property less than $1,000; aggravated sexual 
battery by force or with a weapon; and assault, were nolle prosequi. The remaining 
charge, abduction by force or intimidation, was reduced to attempted unlawful 
wounding. In March 2010, Applicant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and was 
sentenced to be incarcerated for five years, suspended on condition of good behavior, 
and placed on supervised probation for five years unless sooner released. Applicant’s 
probation will expire in June 2015, but he will be eligible for early release in December 
2012. AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(d) have been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG ¶ 32(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.@ Similarly, AG ¶ 32(d) may apply where “there is evidence of successful 
rehabilitation: including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of 
criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good 
employment record, or constructive community involvement.”  
 
AG ¶ 32(a) partially applies. Applicant’s criminal history is actually two very 
diverse incidents separated by seven years of unblemished record. The first incident 
occurred during a period of relative youth when, at about 18 or 19 years of age, he fell 
in with the wrong crowd, decided to use illegal drugs, and carried a knife that was 
classified under state law as a concealed weapon. He was tried and convicted in a 
special court-martial, but most significantly, that portion of the sentence that called for a 
BCD was overturned and Applicant was retained in the USMC. He was returned to duty 
and eventually earned an honorable discharge.  
 
Subsequently, as a civilian employee of a defense contractor, he focused 
exclusively on his job and the mission. Applicant became critical to the success of the 
mission. His focus, however, took its toll, and he had little time to decompress and relax. 
In May 2009, the apparent stress, the lack of sleep, and the consumption of alcohol, 
finally caused a melt-down. Applicant began to exhibit bizarre behavior, leading to some 
very strange actions by him. While he was convicted of attempted unlawful wounding, 
the evidence is clear that he was delusional at the time, but not threatening towards the 
“victim.” He was attempting to protect her. Nevertheless, she was scared. The court 
acknowledged the unusual circumstances when it suspended any incarceration and 
imposed supervised probation. Applicant has successfully completed two years of 
probation and will be eligible to come off probation in December 2012. In addition, in an 
effort to deal with and confront the issues that resulted in his conduct, Applicant did an 
assessment of his life and other factors. He underwent two mental health evaluations, 
and made changes to his personal habits, including getting more rest and stopping 
 
11 
                                      
 
consuming alcohol. He has developed a support group. Since his May 2009 arrest, he 
has avoided any subsequent participation in any criminal activity. Over three years have 
elapsed since Applicant’s most recent criminal activity happened, and it happened 
under very unusual circumstances. With his changed lifestyle, it is unlikely that such 
criminal behavior will recur, and it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
AG ¶ 32(d) partially applies. Applicant’s character references and those who 
wrote favorable communications reveal his outstanding employment record and praise 
him for his “mission critical support.” In addition, while he has not yet completed his five- 
year period of supervised probation, he has successfully completed nearly one-half of 
the entire period of probation. These factors, along with the absence of any misconduct 
since May 2009, and his life-changing activities and perspective, present substantial 
evidence of successful rehabilitation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.62       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He used drugs 
while on active duty, and was convicted in 2002 in a special court-martial of wrongful 
use of methamphetamine, wrongful use of marijuana, and unlawfully carrying a 
concealed weapon. His most recent criminal conduct occurred in 2009 when he was 
convicted of attempted unlawful wounding, and placed on supervised probation for five 
years unless sooner released. Applicant’s probation will expire in June 2015, but he will 
be eligible for early release in December 2012.

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
12 
                                      
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
When he was 19 years old, Applicant was convicted in a special court-martial of three 
criminal counts. He was retained on active duty and rehabilitated himself to the point 
that he eventually earned both the Good Conduct Medal and an honorable discharge. 
Over the next seven years, he was an exemplary employee, praised by superiors and 
those whose missions he supported. However, in May 2009, the confluence of several 
factors including little time to decompress and relax, stress, lack of sleep, and the 
consumption of alcohol, finally caused a melt-down. Applicant began to exhibit bizarre, 
delusional behavior. He was subsequently convicted of attempted unlawful wounding. 
Applicant did an assessment of his life and other factors, obtained mental health 
evaluations, and made changes to his personal habits, including getting more rest and 
stopping consuming alcohol. Since his May 2009 arrest, he has avoided any 
subsequent participation in any criminal activity. Applicant’s probation will expire in June 
2015, but he will be eligible for early release in December 2012. He is 29 years old and 
effusively praised by senior officials for his mission critical work. Under the evidence 
presented, I have no questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability 
to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). For all of these 
reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his 
criminal conduct.
