DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Based upon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
On October 5, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86). On July 21, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 
effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
 On August 23, 2011, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have 
the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 13, 2011, 
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing ten Items, 
 
2 
 
 
and mailed Applicant a complete copy on September 14, 2011. Applicant received the 
FORM on October 4, 2011, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and 
submit additional information. He did not submit additional documents. On December 1, 
2011, DOHA assigned the case to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in Paragraph 1. He 
denied that he intentionally omitted information from his SF 86 as alleged in Paragraph 
2. His admissions and statements in response to DOHA interrogatories are incorporated 
into the following findings. 
 
 Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active 
duty in the U.S. Army from 1994 to 2000. He was honorably discharged. He married in 
1995 and divorced in 2006. He has one child from that marriage, for whom he pays 
child support. He began working as a field engineer for his current employer in October 
2010. Prior to this position he worked for another defense contractor from September 
2004 to August 2010. He was unemployed from August to October 2010. While 
employed by his former employer, he worked in a hostile fire zone in the Middle East 
from April 2007 to May 2008. (Item 5.)  
 
 In response to Question 26c on his October 5, 2010 SF 86, Applicant disclosed 
that he failed to file  tax returns for 2005 and 2006.1
 
 He did not disclose that he had not 
filed  tax returns for 2007, 2008, or 2009. In his response to the SOR, he asserted that it 
was “an oversight” because at the time he completed the SF 86 he was waiting for 
documents from the Internal Revenue Service necessary to prepare the returns. (Item 
4; Item 7 at 6.)  
 In November 2010, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about 
delinquent debts, unfiled tax returns, and unpaid taxes. He was familiar with a $398 
delinquent debt owed to a cable company and a $1,628 delinquent debt owed to a 
bank. (Item 8 at 8.) He acknowledged that he had not filed his 2005 and 2006  tax 
returns or paid the taxes. He also indicated that he could not set up a payment plan at 
the time because he had not filed his  returns for 2007, 2008, 2009. (Item 8 at 10.) 
 
 On May 18, 2011, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories. He noted that he 
paid his 2005 and 2006 taxes on May 16, 2011. He intended to contact an accountant 
when he returned from the Middle East to prepare the 2007, 2008, and 2009 returns. 
(Item 7 at 7.)  
 
 The July 21, 2011, SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file  income tax returns 
for tax years of 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and, failed to pay taxes for 2007, 
2008, and 2009. Applicant filed the 2005 and 2006 returns and paid the outstanding 
taxes on May 16, 2011. (Item 7; FORM.) He filed the 2007, 2008, and 2009 returns on 
                                                          
1The  government filed tax liens for 2005 and 2006 on September 16, 2010. (Item 7 at 10.) 
 
3 
 
 
August 19, 2011. He owes $3,000 for 2007, $4,641 for 2008, and nothing for 2009. He 
made one payment on the 2007 taxes and applied for a payment agreement for the 
2008 taxes. (Item 4.) He did not timely file the 2005 and 2006 returns because he was 
going through a divorce and working two jobs at the time. From April 2007 to May 2008 
he was in the Middle East and unable to monitor his mail or obtain the documents he 
needed to prepare his taxes. (Item 7 at 2.) 
 
 The SOR also alleged that Applicant owed a cable bill for $398, delinquent since 
2008, which he recently paid. (Item 4; Item 7 at 8.) The $1,626 delinquent debt became 
delinquent in 2007 and is unpaid. (Id.; Item 9 at 8.) 
 
 Applicant has not participated in credit counseling. He submitted no character 
references or other evidence tending to establish his good judgment, trustworthiness, or 
reliability.  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 
4 
 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations are 
set out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information.  
 
AG ¶ 19 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may 
be disqualifying in this case: 
a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
(g) failure to file annual , state, or local income tax returns as required or 
the fraudulent filing of the same. 
Applicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy two delinquent debts since 
2007, and failed to timely resolve outstanding tax issues for the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 
2008, and 2009. The evidence is sufficient to raise these three disqualifying conditions. 
After the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to 
Applicant to rebut or prove mitigation of those security concerns. The guideline 
includes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial 
considerations in AG ¶ 20:  
 
5 
 
 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.    
Applicant’s outstanding income tax problems started in 2005 and continued into 
2009. He did not file his 2005 and 2006 returns until May 2011, and the 2007, 2008, and 
2009 returns until August 2011. To date, he has not resolved the unpaid taxes for the 
2007 and 2008 taxes. Because the tax issues are not isolated and have been ongoing 
for at least six years, the facts call into question his reliability and cannot trigger the 
application of AG & 20(a). 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to a period of unemployment, divorce, 
and employment in the Middle East. Those circumstances may have been beyond his 
control. However, he provided no evidence that he attempted to act responsibly in 
managing his unpaid  taxes or filing overdue tax returns while they were becoming due. 
AG & 20(b) marginally applies.  
 
Applicant established no mitigation under AG & 20(c). He failed to present 
evidence that he received credit counseling and that his outstanding tax liabilities and 
delinquent debt are under control, as required under AG & 20(c). He paid the 2005 and 
2006 taxes, albeit in May 2011. He applied for a repayment plan for the 2007 and 2008 
taxes, and made one payment on the 2007 taxes. There is no evidence that he has 
entered into said plan. His dilatory actions regarding the resolution of his tax problems 
and repayment of a delinquent debt do not warrant the application of AG & 20(d), which 
requires evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve debts.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to Personal Conduct: 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
AG ¶ 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
The Government alleged in SOR ¶ 2(a) that Applicant falsified his SF 86 by 
failing to disclose that he had not filed his  income tax returns for 2007, 2008, and 2009, 
or paid his taxes, thereby raising a potential disqualification under AG ¶ 16(a).  
Applicant denied the allegations. He attributed the omission of those three tax 
years to an oversight because he was waiting for information from the IRS at the time 
he completed the SF 86. His explanation is not persuasive or credible. He disclosed that 
he had not filed his 2005 and 2006 tax returns or paid outstanding taxes. He 
undoubtedly knew that he had not filed the next three years of returns or paid taxes due 
on them at the time, and had an obligation to reveal the information. His failure to 
disclose the information does not appear to be the result of a negligent mistake, but 
rather an intentional decision. 
AG ¶ 17 includes three conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising 
under this guideline: 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior 
is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
 
7 
 
 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. 
None of the three mitigating conditions apply. The Government learned of 
Applicant’s tax issues for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 during its interview with him in 
November 2010. He did not come forward with the information prior to the interview; 
hence AG ¶ 17(a) does not apply. His intentional non-disclosure is a serious offense 
and raises questions about his trustworthiness. The evidence does not support the 
application of AG ¶ 17(c). Because Applicant denied intentional wrongdoing, AG ¶ 17(d) 
does not apply.   
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). They include the following:  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual, who 
honorably served in the military for six years and should be familiar with the necessity of 
full disclosure and candor when completing government documents. He is responsible 
for his voluntary choices and conduct that underlie the security concerns set out in the 
SOR. He demonstrated a five-year history of not meeting income tax obligations from 
2005 to 2009, as well as a lack of good judgment and reliability. Despite learning of the 
Government’s concerns in November 2010, he did not begin filing  tax returns or paying 
unpaid taxes until May 2011. Three months later he filed the three outstanding  tax 
returns, but has not begun a repayment plan for his 2007 and 2008 taxes. He has not 
addressed one large delinquent debt to date. Applicant failed to demonstrate financial 
rehabilitation, so the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of income tax issues 
remains a concern. Additionally, his explanation for not disclosing unfiled tax returns 
was not credible for a former soldier. The record contains insufficient other evidence 
about his character, trustworthiness, or responsibility to mitigate these concerns. 
 
8 
 
 
 
Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant’s present 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, he did not 
mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:              For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant  
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
