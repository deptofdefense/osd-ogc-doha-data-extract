HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has one unpaid tax debt and fourteen collection and charged-off 
accounts totaling approximately $27,000. He hopes to obtain a clearance so he can 
obtain employment and pay his past-due obligations. He has been unemployed since 
being injured in and discharged from the U.S. Army. Following the hearing, he paid 
$320 on his debts. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the security concerns under 
financial considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke 
his eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive 
Order and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006.

a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 4, 2011, detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, financial considerations. 
  
 On May 11, 2011, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
August 1, 2011, I was assigned the case. On August 15, 2011, DOHA issued a Notice 
of Hearing for the hearing held on September 2, 2011.  
 
 Government exhibits (Exs.) 1 through 12 were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted one exhibit, Exhibit A, which was admitted 
into evidence without objection. The record was held open to allow Applicant to submit 
additional information. On September 15, 2011 and September 28, 2011, additional 
material was submitted and admitted into the record without objection as Ex. B through 
Ex. F. On September 12, 2011, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the factual allegations in the 
SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the pleadings 
and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old transient alert technician who is seeking to obtain a 
security clearance. Applicant called no witnesses other than himself, and produced no 
work or character references. He hopes to obtain a clearance so he can obtain 
employment and pay his past-due obligations. (Ex. D) He has been offered a job 
contingent on his ability to obtain a clearance. During a September 2010 interview, he 
indicated he intended to repay his past-due debts when he was able to return to work. 
(Ex. 9)  
 
Following the hearing, Applicant asserted he was unsuccessful in his efforts to 
consolidate his debts. (Ex. D) He stated he had contacted each of his creditors and 
made a verbal agreement to repay his debts. (Exs. C, D) He stated he would be making 
monthly payments to his creditors and provided copies of 16 money orders for $20 
payments to 14 of the SOR debts. (Exs. D, E-1 through E-6) He paid $320. He made 
two payments to one creditor (Exs. C-1, E-1) and also made a $20 payment on a $300 
credit card debt not listed in the SOR, but listed on his January 2007, September 2009, 
March 2011, and August 2011 credit bureau reports (CBR). (Exs. C-3, E-3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 
12)  
 
From 1985 to February 2000, Applicant was on active duty in the U.S. Air Force 
as an aircraft munitions loader. (Tr. 26) He left active duty as an E-5. (Ex. B, Tr. 56) He 
then transferred to the Air National Guard where he was employed until 2002. (Ex. B, 
Tr. 26, 57) While employed in the Guard, he paid taxes to State A. (Tr. 29) From 2002 
through 2005, he was employed overseas. (Tr. 31) State B filed two tax liens against 
Applicant in November 2009 for unpaid State A income tax in the amounts of $5,639 
and $433 (SOR 1.a). Applicant grew up in State B, finished high school there, he was a 
resident of the state when he enlisted in the Air Force, his mother lives in the state, and 
2 
 
the company he was working for had its headquarters in State A. However, he had not 
lived in State A since the mid-1980s and did not live there before moving to his 
overseas duty location. (Tr. 25, 38) State B asserts Applicant owes $6,905 in state 
income taxes for tax years 2004 and 2005. 
 
Applicant was married from January 1991 through September 1991, and a 
second time from December 2003 through February 2009. (Tr. 33) He has two adult 
children ages 22 and 23, and a third child, age 16, for whom he pays child support. (Ex. 
A, Tr. 34) He is current on his child support obligation. (Tr. 69)  
 
In October 2001, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. Prior to 
filing, Applicant and his spouse were maintaining two households. (Tr. 44) His ex-wife’s 
spending habits contributed to the bankruptcy. (Tr. 68) At the time of filing, Applicant’s 
annual income was approximately $16,000 and his wife’s annual income was $32,000. 
(Ex. A) At the time she was an E-7 in the U.S. Air Force. (Tr. 69) They listed $5,000 in 
assets and $43,000 in liabilities. (Ex. A) Their combined met monthly take home pay 
was approximately $3,000 and their monthly expenses were approximately $3,500. (Ex. 
A) On January 14, 2002, his debts were discharged. 
 
In September 2010, Applicant was interviewed concerning his finances. In 
February 2011, he answered written interrogatories concerning his delinquent accounts. 
Applicant’s 2007 CBR lists his bankruptcy, a repossessed vehicle, a returned check, 
two accounts charged off, and ten collection accounts. (Ex. 7) It lists five accounts as 
“paid as agreed” or “paid satisfactorily.” His September 2010 CBR lists 14 collection 
accounts and 3 accounts paid “as agreed.” (Ex. 8) None of Applicant’s accounts listed in 
his March 2011 or August 2011 CBR are listed as “pays as agreed.” (Exs. 11, 12) Both 
CBRs list three collection accounts and four charged-off accounts.  
 
In 2004, Applicant returned to the United States for a few weeks before obtaining 
another overseas job. (Tr. 39) In 2005, he returned to the United States from his second 
overseas employment and was employed in State C for some period of time before 
being laid off. (Tr. 40) He was unemployed for a year and a half prior to March 2007, he 
joined the U.S. Army. (Tr. 59)  He moved to State D and served two years in the Army, 
until he severely injured his knee, resulting in his June 2009 medical discharge. (Tr. 41) 
He received a 30 percent disability rating, which pays him $730 monthly. (Tr. 41, 42) 
For the past two and a half years, since leaving the Army, he has been unemployed. 
(Tr. 59) At the time of the hearing, he was receiving state unemployment compensation. 
(Tr. 54) 
 
Applicant completed his 2002, 2004, and 2005 federal tax returns and gave them 
to his wife to sign and send to the IRS. (Ex. 10, Tr. 60) She failed to do this. The returns 
were not filed until 2009. He owed the IRS $17,000 and arranged to make $288 monthly 
payments on the debt. (Ex. 10, Tr. 60) After leaving the Army in 2009, he has been 
unable to make his monthly payments. (Tr. 60) State B claims he owes $6,901 in state 
taxes.

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
6 
 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the National interests of security is the paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
7 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant’s debts were discharged 
in January 2002 through bankruptcy. Currently, he owes approximately $7,000 in state 
income tax and has 14 unpaid collection accounts which total approximately $27,000. 
Four of Applicant’s debts were for approximately $400 or less each. Additionally, he 
owes the IRS approximately $17,000 for delinquent taxes, which are not listed as a debt 
of concern in the SOR. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply.  
 
Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
8 
 
In January 2002, all of Applicant’s debts were discharged through bankruptcy 
and he received a fresh start financially. The bankruptcy caused in part by his now ex-
spouse’s spending habits. Five of the SOR debts (SOR 1.f, $296; SOR 1.r $2,490 
judgment; SOR 1.s, $8,167 judgment; SOR 1.t, $1,820, SOR 1.u, $1,350 judgment) 
totaling approximately $14,000 were included in the bankruptcy and were discharged. I 
find in favor of Applicant on these five debts. Additionally, I do not find against him for 
having to seek bankruptcy protection in 2002 (SOR 1.q).  
 
In December 2010 and again in February 2011, Applicant was questioned about 
his delinquent accounts. He made no payments on his accounts until after his hearing 
when he paid his creditors $320. He did not set forth the terms of those verbal 
agreements with his creditors and made but a single payment to each of the creditors. 
Had he shown evidence of three or four months of payments under a repayment 
arrangement the likelihood would be much greater that the monthly payments would 
continue until the delinquent obligations were met. Such a conclusion cannot be drawn 
from a single payment to each creditor.  
 
For the past two years, Applicant’s primary source of income has been his $400 
weekly unemployment benefits and the $730 monthly disability income. He does not 
have substantial assets that could be converted to cash for debt repayment at this time. 
However, he had financial problems before his 2009 injury as evidenced by his 2007 
CBR. That CBR lists: a repossessed vehicle, a returned check, two accounts charged 
off, and ten collection accounts. At that time, he was paying five of his accounts as 
agreed, including his child support obligation.  
 
When Applicant was asked about his delinquent accounts in September 2010, he 
stated he intended to pay them when he was able. An expressed desire to pay one’s 
debts without further action in addressing the debts is insufficient to warrant mitigation. 
Normally a promise,2 however credible and sincere, to take remedial steps in the future 
is not evidence of actual rehabilitation. The decision to grant or deny a security 
clearance must be based on past conduct and not speculation as to future hopes and 
desires. Mitigation consists of progress made in addressing past-due obligations. In this 
case Applicant has made some payment on the SOR obligations.  
 
Because Applicant has multiple delinquent debts and his financial problems are 
continuing in nature, he receives minimal application of the mitigating conditions listed in 
AG ¶ 20(a). There is limited evidence to indicate the debts were incurred under 
circumstances unlikely to be repeated. Some were due to his ex-spouse’s actions, but 
other debt did not result from his marriage. Applicant asserted, but provided no 
documentation, that he did not owe the state income tax listed in SOR 1.a. Because 
approximately $27,000 of delinquent debt remains unpaid there is doubt about his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
                                                          
2 A promise to take remedial steps in the future does not constitute evidence of demonstrated reform and 
rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0544 (May 12, 1997) at p. 5 (a promise to take remedial 
action in future, however credible and sincere, is not evidence of actual rehabilitation).  
 
9 
 
 
Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to 
circumstances outside his or her control, the Judge could still consider whether 
Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial 
difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. January 12, 2007) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. November 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 
(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. December 1, 1999). 
 
Although Applicant’s divorce and medical separation from the Army were factors 
beyond his control, AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies because Applicant was 
experiencing financial problems before his discharge and only a portion of the debt 
resulted from the marriage. He showed only limited evidence of the impact his divorce 
on his finances. AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply because was no showing he had received 
financial counseling and that there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control. The DOHA Appeal Board has previously noted that an 
applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts 
immediately or simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by 
“concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the 
plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
An applicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each and every debt 
listed in the SOR, but must demonstrate he has established a plan to resolve his 
delinquent debt and has taken significant action to implement that plan. The entirety of 
Applicant’s financial situation and his actions must be evaluated to determine if that plan 
is credible and realistic. A reasonable plan may provide for payment on such debts one 
at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. He asserted, but 
failed to document, that he had a verbal agreement with his creditors to repay his debts. 
He provided no additional information as to the terms or the agreement. He asserts he 
has developed a repayment plan, but must also take reasonable actions to effectuate 
the plan. A single payment to each creditor following the hearing is insufficient to be 
found to be a “reasonable action to effectuate the plan.”  
 
Applicant’s plan to obtain his clearance so he can obtain a job to address his 
delinquent accounts is too speculative in nature as to qualify as a mitigating condition as 
set forth in AG ¶ 20(d). For AG ¶ 20(d) to apply there must be the “desire” to repay the 
debts, an “ability” to repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. He has 
expressed the desire to repay, but has neither the current ability or has established a 
systematic, concrete method of handling his delinquent debts. It is noted that eight of 
the twenty debts were for less than $600 each. Even the smallest debt of $105 (SOR 
1.c) has yet to be paid in full.  
  
Good-faith requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, 
an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
10 
 
option (such as bankruptcy or the statute of limitation) in order to claim the benefit of the 
good-faith mitigating condition. ISCR case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. April 20, 2004) 
(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). To date, Applicant has 
made very limited efforts to address his delinquent accounts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
Applicant has some factors in his favor. He was in the Air Force 15 years, in the 
Army 2 years, and in the Air National Guard 2 years. A majority of his adult life has been 
dedicated to military service. However, the whole-person factors against Applicant are 
more substantial than the favorable factors.  His failure to pay or resolve his just debts is 
not prudent or responsible. He has a history of financial problems. In 2002, his 
unsecured delinquent debts were discharged in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy and he had a 
fresh start. Even with that fresh start, by 2007, his CBR were reporting numerous 
collection accounts. His payment of $320 following the hearing is insufficient to establish 
he will continue to make his payments to his creditors. Additionally, there is no 
documentation the creditors have agreed to the repayment plans.  
 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot 
or will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award 
of a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime 
occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to 
the evidence presented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not 
recommended. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security 
clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance 
with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well 
demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness.

The issue is not simply whether all Applicant’s delinquent obligations have been 
paid – they have not – but whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his 
fitness to hold a security clearance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial doubt as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For 
the stated reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns 
arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.g – 1.p:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.q – 1.u:  For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
