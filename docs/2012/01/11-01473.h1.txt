Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of 20 delinquent accounts for more
than $20,000. He did not present documentary evidence showing that he paid, settled,
reduced the balance owed, disputed, or otherwise resolved any of the debts. He does
not have a realistic plan in place to resolve the debts. Applicant failed to present
sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns stemming from his problematic
financial history. Accordingly, as discussed below, this case is decided against
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about June1
23, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement
of reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to me August 11, 2011. The hearing took place October 20, 2011. The transcript (Tr.)
was received October 28, 2011. The record was kept open for two weeks until
November 4, 2011, to allow Applicant to present documentary evidence, as he
presented none during the hearing. To date, no such matters were received. 
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged 21 delinquent accounts in amounts ranging from $35 to $9,197
for a total of about $21,268. In Applicant’s reply to the SOR, he admitted the debts
except for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o, claiming it duplicated the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d.
His claim of duplication is accepted as valid and a favorable finding will be made on one
of those allegations. His admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated herein
as findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial
evidence.
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been
employed as a systems engineer for a company engaged in defense contracting since
September 2010. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for that job, which pays
an annual salary of $92,000.  He is unmarried and has a 21-year-old child. He has lived2
with his parents, at their request, since April 2009 so he can assist them financially. His
two adult sisters and two minor children also live in the same household. Applicant and
his mother, who works as a nurse, are providing the financial support for the household.
In addition to his current job, Applicant and his father have operated their own
computer-consulting company since 2007. Initially, the company was profitable, but it
 Tr. 37. 3

 Exhibit 2. 5
 Exhibits 2–5. 6
3
has generated no revenue in 2011 or 2010.  He worked a regular job during most of the3
same period. According to his security clearance application,  he was unemployed4
(aside from his consulting job) from August 2009 to September 2010. Otherwise, he
has been continuously employed by multiple firms since October 2001. In 1999, he
broke his neck while riding rodeo. As a result, he underwent a cervical fusion procedure.
He was then out of work until returning in October 2001. He relied on his family for
financial support during this period of unemployment. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties. He was unaware of
any financial problems until about September 2010 when he obtained a credit report in
preparation for completing his security clearance application.  As alleged in the SOR,5
and established by his admissions and the documentary evidence,  the delinquent6
debts consist of the following: (1) a $1,178 unpaid judgment filed in about June 2008;
(2) a $752 collection account; (3) a $35  collection account; (4) a $170 collection
account; (5) a $144 medical collection account; (6) a $149 collection account; (7) a
$210 collection account; (8) a $392 collection account; (9) $735 collection account; (10)
a $350 medical collection account; (11) a $9,197 collection account; (12) a $2,316
collection account; (13) a $2,055 charged-off account; (14) a $2,435 collection account;
(15) a $170 collection account (which is a duplicate account); (16) a $224 collection
account; (17) a $149 collection account; (18) a $154 collection account; (19) a $180
collection account; (20) a $129 collection account; and (21) a $144 collection account. 
Applicant claims, in his Answer to the SOR and in his hearing testimony, that he
paid certain accounts, that he is in the process of paying others, and that he had tried to
pay or contact others. At hearing, he did not present any documentary evidence in
support of his claims. Likewise, after the hearing, he not present any documentary
evidence. Given the lack of documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not paid,
settled, reduced the balance owed, disputed, or otherwise resolved any of the debts. 
Applicant has no sizeable assets or cash money in the bank. He has not sought
counseling, assistance, or advise from a financial professional (e.g., an accountant, a
certified financial counselor, a credit counselor, etc.) to address his debts. 
Law and Policies
The only purpose of a security clearance case is to determine if a person is
suitable for access to classified information. And it is well-established law that no one
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to a7
security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to ath
security clearance).

has a right to a security clearance.  As  noted by the Supreme Court in Department of7
Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive8
Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be
allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national
security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An9
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  10
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting11
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An12
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate13
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme14
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation

The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it17
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant18
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline19
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  20
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. The 20 delinquent debts for more than $20,000 raise security
concerns, and they indicate inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of21
not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are22
sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions, and the facts also suggest
financial irresponsibility.   
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a23
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort). 
 
6
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;23
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
None of the mitigating conditions, individually or in combination, are sufficient to
overcome and mitigate the security concerns. With regard to AG ¶ 20(b), I considered
the periods of unemployment during 1999–2001 and 2009–2010. The former period,
although of some duration, is too remote in time to explain his present circumstances.
The latter period was recent, and it certainly had a negative effect on Applicant’s overall
financial situation and ability to meet his financial obligations. 
 See ISCR Case No. 03-23511 (App. Bd. Fed. 15, 2006) (it is reasonable to expect an applicant to have24
documentation about satisfaction of specific debts). 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).25
7
With that said, Applicant has done little to help himself. What is missing here is
documented proof that he has made progress in resolving his delinquent debts.  In24
other words, he has not: (1) articulated a comprehensive approach for addressing his
20 delinquent debts for more than $20,000; (2) reasonably documented actions taken in
furtherance of that approach; and (3) demonstrated a not insubstantial reduction in
indebtedness and an improvement to his financial situation. Indeed, there is no
indication of a favorable upward trend upon which to rely. His statements that he has
made payments in the past and his promises to pay in the future are insufficient
evidence in mitigation. Looking forward, there is a strong likelihood that his financial
problems will continue.     
The evidence of Applicant’s unresolved and ongoing delinquent debts justifies
current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and
the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national
security. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered
if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Based on the evidence before me, it is too25
soon to tell if or when Applicant will establish a track record of financial responsibility.
Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance
decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.n: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.o: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.p–1.u: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
