Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant’s financial problems resulted from the national economic downturn that
caused his wife’s restaurant business to fail. He and she have resolved most of their
delinquent debt and are making substantial payments toward their lone remaining
delinquent account. Clearance is granted.
On August 4, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations).
Applicant’s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on September 7, 2011. He denied
all SOR allegations except subparagraph 1.b, and he requested a hearing.
The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2011. A notice of hearing was issued
on November 9, 2011, scheduling the hearing for December 6, 2011. The hearing was

conducted as scheduled. The Government submitted six documentary exhibits that were
marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection.
Applicant testified and submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant
Exhibits (AE) 1-4 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was
received on December 21, 2011.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admission to the one SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant is a 55-year-old man who has been employed as a supply clerk by a
defense contractor since August 2009. He graduated from high school in September 1973,
and he enlisted in the Navy in August 1977. Applicant served continuously on active duty
in the Navy until he honorably retired as a petty officer first class in August 1997. Applicant
was employed as a field inventory systems coordinator outside the defense industry from
August 1997 until he was laid off due to a company downsizing in January 2009. He
worked as a pass and ID clerk/supply clerk for a defense contractor from October 2008
until August 2009. Applicant has also been working a part-time job to supplement his
income since 2008.
Applicant has been married since March 1982. His wife is an Australian citizen who
has been granted permanent resident alien status in the United States. Applicant and his
wife have two children, ages 29 and 24.
Applicant’s wife, deciding to go into business for herself, opened a café in 2005. The
business was financed by $75,000 Applicant had accumulated in savings and a $100,000
home equity loan. The income from the café was sufficient to pay expenses without
Applicant’s wife earning a profit. In 2007, she purchased a second more modern café with
the intent to sell the first café. The purchase of the second café coincided with the national
economic downturn, and, as a result, she not only was unable to sell the first café, but she
also failed to earn enough income from the second café to cover operating expenses.
Without Applicant’s knowledge, his wife began using two credit cards to cover the
operating expenses for the cafes. Still unable to make the cafes profitable, Applicant’s wife
closed them both in August 2009, and allowed the landlords to repossess all the equipment
they contained. Neither landlord has pursued any other action against Applicant  or his wife
based on the early termination of the leases.
The credit card company listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a obtained a judgment in
the amount of $14,039 against Applicant in October 2008. Applicant made an initial
payment of $4,000 to satisfy the judgment and monthly payments thereafter. That
judgment was fully satisfied as of January 2011. (AE 2)
Applicant began making $500 monthly payments toward the $24,000 delinquent
debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b about eight months ago. As of December 5, 2011, the
balance owed on that account had been reduced to $21,510.74. (AE 3). The statement
from the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b (AE 3) identifies it as a successor account

owner to the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c. Although not listed in the SOR,
Applicant submitted verification that he is making in excess of the minimum payment due
to the creditor from which he obtained the home equity loan to finance his wife’s cafes. 
Applicant’s annual salary from his full-time employment is approximately $37,500.
His annual Navy retirement income is approximately $15,600, and he annually earns about
$14,500 from his part-time employment. Applicant’s wife is currently residing in Australia
with her sister and working for a mining company earning $47 an hour. They intend for her
to continue that employment until they have satisfied their sole remaining delinquent credit
card account. Applicant had approximately $3,000 in his checking account at the time of
the hearing. He estimated his wife had about $5,000 in a savings account. Applicant’s
credit reports disclose he paid all his accounts “As agreed” before his wife’s restaurant
business began to fail.      
  
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision must be a fair
and impartial decision based upon relevant and material facts and circumstances, the
whole-person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive.
Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against
clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Guideline F (financial
considerations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case.
  The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of5
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant6
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against

him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant accumulated a substantial amount of delinquent debt on two credit cards
as a result of his wife’s failed restaurant business. One of those debts resulted in a
judgment being entered against him. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 19(a): inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts applies.
Applicant’s credit reports disclosed he remained current on all his debts until his
wife’s business began to fail. He fully satisfied the judgment that had been entered against
him about eight months before the SOR in this case had been issued. Upon satisfaction
of the judgment, Applicant began making $500 monthly payments to satisfy the remaining
delinquent credit card debt. As of the date of the hearing, he had reduced that debt by
about $2,500. He is working two jobs to earn the income needed to fully satisfy his
remaining delinquent debt, and his wife has temporarily relocated to live with her sister
where she can earn a substantial income to assist in liquidating their remaining delinquent
debt. 
   
The following Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply: MC 20(a): the behavior happened
so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
5
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly
under the circumstances; MC 20(c): . . . there are clear indications that the problem is
being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, the whole-person concept, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant mitigated the financial
considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his
ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. 
 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-c: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is granted.
