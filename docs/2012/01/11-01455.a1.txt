APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On July 13, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
2
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a decision on the written record.  On November 16, 2011, after considering the record,
Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.
Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant was afforded an opportunity to reply to the SOR.  By means of his appeal brief,
he has provided evidence that he submitted two attachments to his response to the SOR.  However,
these documents were not made part of the record.  
In similar circumstances we have remanded the case for resolution of the problem.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 10-00133 (App. Bd. Aug 18, 2011) and ISCR Case No. 08-11322 (App. Bd. May
7, 2010).  Accordingly, the case is hereby remanded to the Judge for further processing.  Nothing
contained in this action shall prejudice the appeal rights of the parties.
