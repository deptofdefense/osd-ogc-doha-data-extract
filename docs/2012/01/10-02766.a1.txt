APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 4, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
1To the extent Applicant’s brief can be construed as arguing that the record would support a favorable decision,
such an argument is not sufficient to demonstrate error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-09072 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2011).

Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On October 21, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert E.
Coacher denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief makes no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.  The
brief contains a recitation as to why Applicant’s case should be adjudicated favorably.  Applicant
states in some detail why he believes the Government’s security concerns regarding his financial
troubles have been mitigated.
Some of Applicant’s representations contain facts not considered below.  By explicit
mandate, the Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  The Board
does not review a case de novo.1  Rather, the Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited
to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  See Directive
¶ E3.1.32.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is
AFFIRMED.
