MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations concern. He owes over 
$21,000 on four judgments and two other past-due debts that date back several years. 
He recently started to address his overdue debts, but it is too early to say that his 
financial situation is under control. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 18, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) made a 
preliminary determination to deny Applicant access to classified information.1 The basis 
for this decision is set forth in a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that alleges the security 
concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant filed his response on 
June 24, 2011 (Answer). He admitted all but two of the debts alleged in the SOR, and 
requested a hearing.

 This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

 Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed with a 
hearing on August 4, 2011. After coordinating with the parties, I scheduled the hearing 
for September 20, 2011. At hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and 
Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A through L were admitted into evidence without objection. The 
Government did not call any witnesses. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on September 28, 2011.2 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 42 years old. He separated from his wife in approximately 2004 and 
divorced in August 2011. In 2004, he was granted full custody of his two children, who 
are now 12 and 17 years old. He attributes his financial difficulties to having to raise his 
children on his own without financial support from his ex-wife, and being unemployed 
from January to May 2010.3  
 
The SOR alleges 20 debts. After the SOR was issued, Applicant paid the five 
minor debts referenced in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.n, and 1.s, totaling $1,189.4 Also after 
the SOR was issued, Applicant successfully disputed the six debts alleged in ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.k, and 1.o through 1.r, which total $2,362.5 He also established a payment plan to 
satisfy the debt in ¶ 1.j, and submitted proof of partial payment.6  
 
Applicant still owes over $21,000 for four judgments and two past-due debts. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.h and 1.m). One judgment was issued in 2004, and the other 
three were issued in 2008. The two past-due debts consist of a car repossession and an 
old cable bill. After the SOR was issued, Applicant made arrangements to satisfy one of 
the judgments and submitted proof of one payment for $100.7 
 
 In 2004, a judgment was issued in favor of Applicant’s former landlord in the 
amount of $1,941. This debt is referenced in SOR ¶ 1.g, and is reflected on Applicant’s 
credit reports. Applicant disputes this judgment, claiming he resided at the apartment in 
question until 2010 without issue, and that the alleged debt is still pending adjudication 
by the civil court system. He submitted a civil summons to appear for trial for non-

payment of rent, and claims this new civil matter relates to the 2004 judgment. He did 
not present any documentation that the 2004 judgment had been overturned or 
otherwise invalidated. Further, the named plaintiff in this new action is not the same as 
the creditor who was awarded the 2004 judgment.8 The 2004 judgment remains unpaid. 
 
 In 2008, Applicant had three judgments issued against him. The first of these 
judgments is referenced in SOR ¶ 1.d for $6,136. This judgment is for damage and 
carpet replacement Applicant owed when he moved out of another apartment in 2006. 
The judgment is reflected on Applicant’s credit reports. After the SOR was issued, 
Applicant made arrangements to satisfy this debt and submitted proof of one payment in 
the amount of $100 from June 2010.9 This 2008 judgment remains unpaid. 
 
 The second of the 2008 judgments is referenced in SOR ¶ 1.e for $1,026. This 
judgment was for a personal loan Applicant did not repay. Applicant’s former girlfriend 
lent him money to pay an overdue school bill. This judgment is reflected on Applicant’s 
credit reports. He denies this debt, claiming the money was a gift, not a loan.10 Applicant 
submitted e-mails from his former girlfriend from 2008, in which she asks that he repay 
the loan.11 He explained that when they broke up, she demanded that he repay the 
money. At the time, he told her:  “Sure. I don’t have a problem giving you the money 
back . . . you helped me out. I’ll give you the money back.”12 Applicant did not repay the 
loan, and his former girlfriend obtained a civil judgment against him. At hearing, 
Applicant initially testified that he did not have the opportunity to contest the claim in 
court, because he “didn’t know there was a court date” and “the judgment just appeared 
on (his) credit report.” Upon being questioned, Applicant admitted he had been notified 
of the court date and had failed to appear, resulting in the entry of a default judgment.13 
Prior to the hearing, Applicant told a Government investigator that he had repaid a 
majority of the loan.14 As of the hearing, Applicant’s efforts to satisfy the loan consisted 
of two e-mails to his former girlfriend seeking to satisfy the judgment. The e-mails were 
sent after the SOR was issued.15 This 2008 judgment remains unpaid.

 The third of the 2008 judgments is referenced in SOR ¶ 1.f for $641. Applicant 
claims this judgment is for unpaid cable service. He denies this judgment, claiming that 
it was likely a result of fraud. This judgment is reflected on Applicant’s credit reports and 
was properly filed in a local court. When Applicant went to the courthouse, he was told 
that he could pay the judgment directly through the court. He did not pay the judgment 
and, instead, is disputing it through the credit agencies. Applicant admits he did not pay 
his cable bill, but claims the amount past-due was the $130 debt referenced in SOR ¶ 
1.m. He previously promised to pay this $130 debt by June 2010. Both the $641 
judgment and $130 cable bill remain unpaid.16 
 
In January 2010, Applicant was fired by his former employer for alleged 
misconduct.17 He was unemployed until May 2010, when he secured a job with his 
current employer. Applicant’s new job requires that he have access to classified 
information and, thus, he submitted a SCA on May 24, 2010. He reported accessing his 
credit report and promised to resolve his debts within 12 months.18 
 
In June 2010, Applicant was interviewed by a Government agent. He told the 
agent that he was unaware of a majority of the debts reflected on his credit report, but 
had recently contacted a debt consolidation firm (DCF1) and was “in the process of 
working out settlement for his debts that are on his credit report.”19 
 
In August 2010, Applicant’s car was repossessed. This is the $12,000 debt 
referenced in SOR ¶ 1.h. Applicant has contacted this creditor, but he is unable to pay 
the amount they are asking to settle the debt.20 
 
 In January 2011, DOHA sent Applicant an interrogatory that requested, in part, 
information on his past-due debts. Applicant responded on March 16, 2011, and 
reported that he had contracted with a different debt consolidation firm (DCF2) to 
resolve his debts. Applicant’s agreement with DCF2 is dated the day before he submits 
his response. Applicant consolidated $24,000 of unsecured debt with DCF2’s 
assistance. The plan called for Applicant to pay $400 a month for 36 months, at which 
time his debts would be resolved.21

 In June 2011, Applicant stopped sending his monthly payments to DCF2 when 
he realized that half his money was going to pay DCF2’s fees and his debts were not 
being paid. Applicant then contacted some of his creditors directly and used the money 
that he was sending DCF2 to satisfy the past-due debts noted earlier.22 
 
 Applicant earned his college degree in May 2010. He is currently taking graduate 
level coursework, and has a 3.0 GPA while working full time. He does not own a car, 
has no credit cards, and by all indications lives a modest lifestyle.23 He spoke to an 
attorney about the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, but was “told by the attorney that 
with the new bankruptcy laws, (he would) still have to pay” his debts.24 He plans on 
“hunkering down” and paying off his debts within the next year or two.25 
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.  
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision.  
 
The Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. On the other hand, an applicant is responsible for 
presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts 
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.26 An 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
In resolving this ultimate question, an administrative judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt

concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information . . . in favor 
of national security.” AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. “A 
clearance adjudication is an applicant’s opportunity to demonstrate that, prior to being 
awarded a clearance, he (or she) actually possesses the judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness essential to a fiduciary relationship with this country.”27 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, 
consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to financial problems is articulated at AG ¶ 18, as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
One aspect of the concern is that an individual who is financially irresponsible 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Applicant’s accumulation of a substantial amount of 
debt, dating back several years, directly implicates this concern. It also establishes the 
following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 An applicant’s past or current indebtedness is not the end of the analysis, 
because “[a] security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an 
applicant’s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
                                                          
27
 ISCR Case No. 10-09986 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2011).

judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.”28 Accordingly, Applicant may mitigate the 
financial considerations concern by establishing one or more of the mitigating conditions 
listed under AG ¶ 20. The relevant mitigating conditions are:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute. 
 
 Applicant’s financial situation is partially attributable to the lack of child support 
from his former spouse and the less than reputable debt consolidation firm that he 
contracted with in March 2011. He also receives some credit under AG ¶¶ 20(d) and (e) 
as to those debts he paid and successfully disputed. However, Applicant’s resolution of 
these debts occurred only after the SOR was issued. Applicant’s recent efforts to 
resolve some of his debts is simply not enough to demonstrate that he currently handles 
his finances responsibly, nor gives me much confidence that he would handle his 
security obligations in a responsible fashion. Further, AG ¶ 20(b) does not fully apply 
because Applicant failed to act responsibly under the circumstances.29 Four of his 
creditors, including a friend that lent him money, had to obtain judgments to force him to 
pay his legal obligations. Even after judgments were issued, Applicant has refused to 
pay. These four judgments date back to 2004 and 2008. Together with the car 
repossession and overdue cable bill, these debts total over $21,000.  
 
                                                          
28
 ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 09-07916 at 3 
(App. Bd. May 9, 2011). 
 
29
 See generally ISCR Case No. 07-09304 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008) (“the second prong of MC 
20(b) requires that an applicant act responsibly under the circumstances”). 
 
 
8 
 
 
 Moreover, at each stage of the security clearance process, from the submission 
of the SCA to his Answer, Applicant has promised to address his debts and then failed 
to follow through. His contradictory and internally inconsistent statements regarding the 
2008 judgment to his former girlfriend, and his lack of effort to resolve the four 
outstanding judgments, continue to cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.30 AG ¶¶ 20(a), (b), and (c) do not apply. In the end, although Applicant 
presented some favorable evidence, it was not enough to meet his burden to mitigate 
the financial considerations concern. His financial problem remains a security concern. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).31 I have considered all the favorable and extenuating 
factors in this case. Applicant took on the burden and responsibility of raising his two 
daughters on his own. He has gone back to school to improve his own job prospects, as 
well as to better provide for his daughters. He recently started paying his old debts. 
These are significant mitigating factors. However, he has a substantial amount of 
unresolved debt and failed to dispel the significant security concerns raised by his 
financial situation. The favorable whole-person factors present in this case do not 
outweigh the security concern at issue.32 Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings regarding the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:         For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.d – 1.h:         Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.i – 1.l:         For Applicant 
  Subparagraph   1.m:         Against Applicant 
                                                          
30
 ISCR Case No. 10-08560 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2011) (a judge may properly consider 
inconsistent statements made by an applicant regarding a debt at issue in order to assess the applicant’s 
“credibility and on whether he had met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation under Guideline F.”). 
 
31
 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; 
(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. 
 
32
 See generally ISCR Case 10-04405 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011) (favorable whole-person 
findings does not necessarily equate with a finding that the security concern at issue has been mitigated). 
 
 
9 
 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.n – 1.t:         For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence and for the foregoing reasons, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is therefore denied.
