ISCR Case No. 10-09986
APPEAL BOARD DECISION
ON APPLICANT’S REQUEST
FOR RECONSIDERATION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
2
On December 15, 2011, the Board issued an Appeal Board Decision in this case.  Applicant
has submitted a motion for reconsideration of that decision.  Department Counsel has submitted a
Reply Brief.  
We have authority to entertain requests to reconsider our decisions.  However, there is no
right to reconsideration; we have the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise our inherent
authority to reconsider one of our decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 08-09704 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Apr.
21, 2010).  
We have considered Applicant’s motion and Department Counsel’s Reply Brief.  Applicant
has failed to articulate a persuasive reason to conclude that, were we to reconsider our decision, we
would reach a different result.  Accordingly, Applicant’s motion is denied.
