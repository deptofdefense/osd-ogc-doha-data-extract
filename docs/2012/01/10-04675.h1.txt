FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant refuted the allegation of 
falsification under Guideline E, but he did not mitigate the security concerns under 
Guideline F. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 1, 2010. On 
July 7, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) preliminarily denied 
his application. DOHA set forth the basis for its decision in a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), citing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. DOHA acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of 
Defense on September 1, 2006.

 Applicant received the SOR on July 29, 2011; answered it on September 9, 
2011; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the 
request on September 14, 2011. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 
28, 2011, and the case was assigned to me on November 4, 2011. DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing on November 28, 2011, scheduling it for December 20, 2011. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were 
admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s 
Exhibits (AX) A through I, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) on December 28, 2011. 
 
I kept the record open until January 13, 2012, to enable Applicant to submit 
additional evidence. He timely submitted AX J through V, which were admitted without 
objection. On January 17, he submitted AX W, and on January 26, 2012, he submitted 
AX X. Department Counsel did not object to the untimely submissions of AX W and AX 
X, and they were admitted. Applicant’s cover emails, including explanations for his 
untimely submissions, are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II. His 
list of exhibits, modified to continue the lettering sequence used during the hearing, is 
attached as HX III. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX J through X are 
attached to the record as HX IV and HX V. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.q, 
but he stated that the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 
1.p were paid, and that he was making payments on the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q. He 
responded to SOR ¶ 2.a, alleging falsification of his SCA by stating, “just forgot to 
change it to yes.” (Answer at 6; AX H at 1.) I have treated this response as a denial of 
SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my 
findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 54-year-old network technician employed by a federal contractor 
since April 2008. He worked for another federal contactor from September 1992 to April 
2008. He received a security clearance from the Department of Defense in August 2000 
and from another Government agency in May 2008.  
 
 Applicant has a high school education. (Tr. 24, 40.) He married his current 
spouse in June 1982. Two children, ages 27 and 24, were born during the marriage. 
Applicant also has a 34-year-old son. 
 
 Applicant has never sought or received financial counseling. (Tr. 75.) However, 
In December 2001, Applicant retained a consumer legal service to assist him in 
resolving his debts. The legal service negotiated settlements of two debts not alleged in 
the SOR. They also assisted him with the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q. 
(AX C at 9-14.) Applicant’s June 2011 credit report reflects that the debt alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.n was closed by him with a zero balance. (GX 2 at 2.) The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o 
was charged off in July 2002. (GX 4 at 9.) It is not reflected on Applicant’s June 2011 or 
 
3 
 
 
March 2010 credit reports, but the record does not reflect whether the debt was 
resolved or was deleted from Appellant’s credit record pursuant to the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act.1 (GX 2; GX 3.)  
 
 In 2007, Applicant’s previous employer cut his biweekly pay from about $1,300 to 
about $800, in lieu of a layoff. (GX 1 at 14; GX 5 at 6; Tr. 26.) He continued to make 
regular payments on his home mortgage through August 2008. He made no payments 
in September or October 2008. He made three monthly payments in November 2008, 
four monthly payments in 2009, two in 2010, and one in 2011. (AX D.) His June 2011 
credit report reflected that his payments were at least 120 days past due in the amount 
of about $79,000. (GX 2 at 1.) This delinquent debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. 
 
Applicant testified that he began seeking a modification of his home mortgage in 
2007. (Tr. 48.) He presented documentary evidence that an application for a loan 
modification was being processed in March 2009, but the record does not reflect the 
disposition of that application. (AX G at 9.) He submitted two more applications for 
modification, the first in April 2010 and the second in December 2010. Both applications 
were unsuccessful. (AX G at 12-17 and 18-22.) He testified that the applications were 
disapproved because he submitted his documentation too late. The record reflects that 
the first modification agreement prepared by the lender was dated March 26, 2010, and 
signed by Applicant and his wife on April 19, 2010, but he did not provide any 
documentary evidence that an untimely submission was the basis for disapproval. The 
documentary evidence of the second modification agreement is unsigned and undated. 
He testified that he sent a $6,000 payment along with the second modification 
agreement, but he submitted no documentary evidence of the payment. (Tr.48-50.) 
 
Applicant sent a partial payment to the lender in June 2011, but it was rejected. 
(Answer at 35; AX G at 3-4.) In April 2011, he hired a law firm to assist him. (Answer to 
SOR at 47, 50, 55-60; AX G at 23-28; Tr. 48-49.) His law firm resubmitted his request 
for modification on December 27, 2011, and his resubmitted request was accepted for 
processing on January 6, 2012. (AX V and W.) On January 26, 2012, Applicant’s law 
firm notified him that the lender approved his application for a loan modification, 
reducing his monthly payments from about $3,400 to about $2,843. Applicant has not 
yet received the modification documents from the lender. (AX X.) 
 
 Applicant enrolled in a debt management plan in March 2010. He made monthly 
$308 payments to the plan, which made payments to seven creditors, including those 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.l. (AX N at 10; AX O.) The record does not 
reflect now many payments Applicant made to this plan. He submitted evidence that, in 
August 2011, he sent a postdated personal check for $157 to the creditor alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.d for less than the balance due, which was $210. (AX Q.) The debt is not fully 
resolved. 
 
                                                          
1 Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a credit report may not list accounts placed for collection or 
charged off that antedate the credit report by more than seven years. The exceptions to this prohibition do 
not apply to this debt. 10 U.S.C. § 1681c. 
 
4 
 
 
 In January 2011, Applicant hired another law firm to negotiate settlements of the 
delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.k. He pays the law firm 
$383 per month pursuant to a five-year debt resolution plan. (AX T.) His June 2011 
credit report reflects that the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f was closed at his request 
with a zero balance, and the credit card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g was closed at his 
request. (GX 2 at 2.)  
 
 The delinquent automobile loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, was not included in any of 
Applicant’s payment plans. He made a $585 payment in October 2011, but the record 
does not reflect any further payments. He received an offer to settle for $2,600 on 
January 11, 2012, but the record does not reflect whether he accepted the offer. (GX 2 
at 1; AX S; Tr. 43.) 
 
 Applicant denied the debt to the insurance company alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. His 
automobile insurance was with this company, and he was aware that his son had been 
at fault in a serious accident (Tr. 58-61,110-12.) His March 2010 credit report reflected 
that collection action was initiated by the insurance company against Applicant in 
December 2009. (GX 3 at 14.) His post-hearing submission included a letter dated 
October 18, 2011, advising him that the claim against him for an accident in May 2009 
might exceed the limits of his policy. The amount of the debt and the fact that the 
collection action preceded the October 2011 letter by almost two years strongly suggest 
that the $363 debt is unrelated to the automobile accident in May 2009. Applicant has 
not contacted his insurance company about the debt or disputed it with the credit 
reporting agencies.  
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q, and 
he asserted that he was making payments on it. However, at the hearing he testified 
that he does not believe that the debt is valid. (Tr. 68-69.) His May 2008 credit report 
reflected that the original creditor referred this debt for collection in March 2004 and is 
among the creditors whose claims he referred to a consumer legal counseling service in 
December 2001. The record does not indicate whether the debt reflected in his May 
2008 credit report is the same debt that was included in his December 2001 payment 
plan or a later debt owed to the same creditor. (GX 4 at 14; AX C at 9.) As of the date 
the record closed, he had not disputed this debt or otherwise resolved it. 
 
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.k are duplicates, as are the debts alleged 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j. Applicant’s June 2011 and March 2010 credit reports reflect that 
they have the same account numbers and similar balances. (GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 8 and 
10.) 
 
 Applicant testified that he owes about $3,000 in federal income taxes for tax 
years 2009 and 2010. He negotiated a payment plan providing for $400 per month. 
Since July 2010, he has made monthly payments totaling $3,200 (AX R.) He also owes 
state income taxes but was not sure of the amount. (Tr. 105-07.) 
 
 
5 
 
 
 Applicant’s wife drives a ten-year-old luxury car. He testified that they are paying 
$500 per month on the loan for this car, and it will be paid off within a month. (Tr. 86-
87.) Applicant testified that he bought a five-year-old luxury car two or three years ago 
for about $20,000, and was making payments of about $800 per month until shortly 
before the hearing, when he voluntarily surrendered it to the lender because the lender 
would not negotiate a lower monthly payment. (Tr. 83-85, 102-03.)  
 
 Applicant’s current take-home pay is about $3,000 per month. He operates a 
small computer business at home that generates about $400 per month. His wife is 
employed outside the home and earns slightly more than Applicant. He has withdrawn 
about $120,000 from his retirement account to make mortgage payments, pay college 
expenses for his children, and paid off some of his debts. (Tr. 75-78.) He now has less 
than $150 in his retirement account. (AX J.) His children have all graduated from college 
and are self-supporting. However, his July 2011 credit report reflects a student loan on 
which payments are 120 days past due. (Answer at 12.) He estimates that he has a net 
monthly remainder of $300-$500 after paying all their living expenses and debt 
payments. (Tr. 90.)

 When Applicant submitted his SCA in March 2010, he answered “No” to question 
26m, asking if he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt during the last 
seven years, and question 26n, asking if he was currently more than 90 days delinquent 
on any debt. However, he added a comment that his home mortgage was more than 
180 days delinquent. (GX 1 at 35.) In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he 
stated that he forgot to change his answers to “Yes” after he added the comment about 
his mortgage. Apparently, Applicant updated a previous SCA and submitted it in March 
2010, but he neglected to change any of his “No” answers to “Yes.” He testified that it 
was an honest mistake, and he denied any intention to conceal derogatory information.  
 
 Applicant enjoys a reputation for skill, responsiveness, and dedication. He has 
received numerous messages from well-satisfied recipients of his technical support. He 
recently received a Certificate of Appreciation from his senior program manager for his 
technical expertise and dedication. (AX F.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
7 
 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts. The concern under this guideline is set out 
in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 Applicant’s credit reports reflect that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k 
duplicate the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i. When the same conduct is alleged 
twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be 
resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 
3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I will resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k for Applicant. 
 
 Applicant’s financial history, as reflected in his credit reports, establishes three 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”), AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 
19(e) (“consistent spending beyond one=s means”).  
 
8 
 
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). Applicant’s 
delinquent debts are numerous and not yet resolved. They did not occur under 
circumstances making them unlikely to recur, because the current economy makes 
Applicant and other contractor employees vulnerable to layoffs and pay reductions. 
Applicant’s children are grown and apparently self-supporting, but his most recent credit 
report reflects that he still faces the burden of unpaid student loans incurred on behalf of 
his children. He is likely to owe a deficiency on the car he recently surrendered to the 
lender. He has not yet resolved his federal income tax debt or determined the amount of 
his state tax debt.2 I conclude that AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant’s pay reduction in 2007 
was a circumstance beyond his control. However, he was in financial distress long 
before his pay reduction. He referred five delinquent debts to a consumer legal service 
in December 2001, including three delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q. 
Furthermore, Applicant has not acted responsibly. He purchased a used luxury car for 
$20,000, incurring monthly payments of $800, without resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.o 
and 1.q. He bought this car two or three years ago, at about the same time he began 
seeking a modification of his mortgage loan. He recently surrendered his automobile to 
the lender, who refused to renegotiate the loan, making him vulnerable to a deficiency 
on the loan. He fell behind on his federal and state taxes. He has taken no action to 
resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.q. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant 
has hired several agencies to assist him by negotiating settlements of his debts, but he 
has not received the type of financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating 
condition. His financial situation is not yet under control. Thus, I conclude that AG ¶ 
20(c) is not established.  
 
                                                          
2 The past-due student loan, federal and state tax debts, and potential deficiency from the voluntary 
repossession of his car were not alleged in the SOR. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be 
considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is 
applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider 
whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered this evidence for these limited 
purposes. 
 
 
9 
 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of 
law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only 
establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement 
the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be 
paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 Applicant has resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.l, 1.n, and 1.p. 
He is making regular payments on the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h. His 
application for a loan modification for the debt alleged in SOR 1.e has been approved 
by the lender. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is established for these delinquent debts. On 
the other hand, his one-time payments on the debts alleged in SOR¶¶ 1.a and 1.d are 
insufficient to establish an ongoing payment plan for these debts. He has done nothing 
to resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.q. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o was 
included in his December 2001 payment plan, but the evidence does not reflect that it 
was resolved, and it is not included in his most recent payment plan. I conclude that AG 
¶ 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.q.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). At the 
hearing, Applicant disputed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q, but he provided no 
documentary evidence of the basis of the dispute or evidence of actions to resolve it. I 
conclude that AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by intentionally failing to 
disclose his delinquent debts. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15 as 
follows:  
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   
 The relevant disqualifying condition in this case is “deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire 
. . . .” AG ¶ 16(a). When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the 
 
10 
 
 
Government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove 
falsification. An administrative judge must consider the evidence as a whole to 
determine an applicant’s state of mind at the time of the omission or misstatement. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant’s level of 
education and business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to 
disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR 
Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). 
 
 Applicant is a mature adult who has been employed by federal contractors for 
many years, and he has held clearances since August 2000. Although he answered the 
financial questions on his SCA in the negative, he disclosed his delinquent mortgage. 
He was candid and sincere at the hearing. It was clear during the hearing that he did 
not have a good grasp of his financial situation. I found his explanation for his 
erroneous answers to the financial questions plausible and credible. I conclude that AG 
¶ 16(a) is not established. No other enumerated disqualifying conditions under this 
guideline are established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant has struggled with delinquent debts for at least ten years. His pattern is 
to take on too much debt and then climb out of the financial hole he has dug by 
negotiating new terms on his contracts or settlements for less than the full amount due. 
His recent surrender of his automobile because of the lender’s refusal to renegotiate the 
contract is typical of his modus operandi.

 A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) Applicant resolved six debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.l, 
1.n, and 1.p). He is making regular payments on three debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h.) 
However, the resolution of these debts does not end the inquiry into his judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. He has a long history of delinquent debts. He is less than 
one year into a five-year debt resolution plan. In the context of his financial history, his 
payment history under his most recent payment plan is too short to establish a track 
record of financial responsibility. He has not begun to make payments on his modified 
home loan. He has a federal tax debt, a state tax debt for an amount not yet 
determined, a potential repossession deficiency for the car he recently surrendered, and 
a past-due student loan. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and 
E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has refuted the allegation of falsification under Guideline E, but he has not 
mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F. Accordingly, I conclude he has not 
carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.l:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.m:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.p:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.q:     Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
 
12 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
