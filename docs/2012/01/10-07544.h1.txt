Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties because he overextended himself via a real
estate investment venture that failed. He is now seeking to obtain a discharge of nearly
$900,000 in liabilities through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, which is pending in
bankruptcy court. It is too soon to tell if or when he will resolve his financial problems.
Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns
stemming from his problematic financial history. Accordingly, as discussed below, this
case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,2
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about June2
15, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the security guidelines
known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct. 
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to another judge on September 15, 2011, before it was assigned to me on October 14,
2011. The hearing took place November 2, 2011. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was
received November 10, 2011. 
Procedural Matters
At the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the single
allegation under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his answer to a question, posed in
an April 2010 security clearance application, about his financial record.  Without3
objections, the motion was granted. 
At the close of the evidence, I requested that Department Counsel obtain and
submit, as Government Exhibits, records of Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, as it
was filed the day before the hearing.  Applicant had no objections. Department Counsel4
submitted those matters on November 15, 2011, a copy of which was served upon
Applicant. The bankruptcy case papers are marked and admitted as follows: 
• Exhibit 6–Docket sheet from Chapter 7 bankruptcy case (1 page);
• Exhibit 7–Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, dated November 1, 2011 (49 pages);
• Exhibit 8–Chapter 7 statement of current monthly income and means-test
calculation (7 pages); and 
 Exhibit C. Based on this proof of payment, SOR ¶ 1.h is decided for Applicant. 5

Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged 14 delinquent accounts in amounts ranging from $808 to
$600,000 for a total of about $3.4 million. Thirteen of the accounts are related to a real
estate investment venture and the other is a county tax lien for $808. Applicant admitted
the allegations in his reply to the SOR, except for two real estate debts. He presented
proof of payment for the tax lien, and that matter will not be discussed further.  His5
admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated herein as findings of fact. In
addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been
employed as an electrician and regional program manager for a company engaged in
defense contracting since September 2009. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance
for that job. His first marriage ended in divorce. He remarried in 1997, although he and
his wife have lived separately for some time. He pays all expenses for both homes in
the absence of a separation agreement or court order. 
Applicant’s employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. military
that ended with retirement in 2000. He served on active duty as an enlisted solider in
the Army from 1970 to 1979. He joined the Army National Guard in 1981, and he
received a commission as a second lieutenant in 1982. He transferred to the Army
Reserve a few years later. He then served until about June 2000, when he retired as a
major. He receives military retired pay as a result of his service. He also receives a
state pension for his years of service as a correctional officer. 
The 13 debts at issue are related to a real estate investment venture that failed.
The 13 debts are supported and established by a May 2010 credit report and a March
2011 credit report.  By way of explanation, Applicant has a background in construction,6
which led to him being approached with an opportunity to buy odd or smaller lots and
build new homes to sell. This was part of a larger effort by the local municipality to
remove dilapidated or older houses and replace them with new homes. In total, he
bought about eight lots of land and built three or four homes before he was forced to
stop due to financial problems. He self-financed the venture by obtaining a loan against
his own home. Once the first home was built, he used it as collateral to obtain credit for
the next. He followed this model to finance the balance of the construction. After
building three or four homes, he found he was unable to sell the homes as the real
estate market was declining and the market values of his newly built homes fell below
the costs of construction. This situation was made more difficult because he lives in one
of the states hardest hit by the bursting of the residential real estate market. As a result,

have considered this matter,  the back taxes, and two unpaid judgments noted above, none of which are
alleged in the SOR, for limited purposes such as evaluating Applicant’s claims of extenuation, m itigation, or
changed circumstance, as well as weighing the information under the whole-person concept.

the creditors foreclosed, and five foreclosures are included in the SOR, to which he
admitted in his reply to the SOR.      
At hearing, Applicant maintained that the $3.4 million total amount for the 13
debts was inflated because he is only liable for deficiency claims after the foreclosures.
After substantial consideration of his situation, he elected to pursue bankruptcy. He
intended to file the bankruptcy case in February 2011 and anticipated obtaining a
discharge by April or May 2011.  That schedule apparently slipped as the Chapter 77
bankruptcy petition was filed the day before the hearing on November 1, 2011. A
meeting of creditors was scheduled for December 6, 2011.  Details of the bankruptcy8
case are discussed below. 
Applicant’s bankruptcy petition lists about $1.5 million in liabilities and $592,982
in assets.  The assets consist largely of $560,000 in real property, which are the two9
homes occupied by Applicant and his wife. The other assets consist of personal
property and $1,200 in checking accounts. The liabilities include the following: (1)
$626,286 for secured claims based on three mortgages and three lines of credit tied to
Applicant’s two homes; (2) $2,500 for an unsecured priority claim by the IRS for back
taxes for 2009;  and (3) $878,695 for 22 unsecured nonpriority claims. Of those 2210
claims or debts, there are 10 deficiency claims, 2 judgments for a total of more than
$50,000 obtained by the local municipality, and 10 other claims. He intends to retain his
two homes and continue to make payments on the related six loans.  Five foreclosures11
are listed in the bankruptcy petition; three foreclosures occurred in 2008 and two in
2010.12
The bankruptcy case papers also report Applicant’s current income and
expenditures.  His monthly income includes $4,338 in wages and $4,925 in pension13
and retirement income for a total of $9,263. That figure is largely consistent with what
he disclosed in a personal financial statement.  Deductions from income, such as14

monthly living expenses and debt payment, amount to $9,952. He has a negative
monthly disposable income of about $689.    
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As15
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt16
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An17
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  18
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting19
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An20
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate21
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme22
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.23
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.24

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation

 AG ¶ 18.  28

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it25
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant26
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline27
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  28
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. The evidence raises security concerns and indicates inability or

unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within29 30
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions, and the facts also suggest that Applicant’s financial house is in disrepair.   
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;31
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
None of the mitigating conditions, individually or in combination, are sufficient to
overcome and mitigate the security concerns. Three of the conditions are most pertinent
and they are discussed below. 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).32

Concerning AG ¶ 20(b), I note that Applicant became immersed in a real estate
investment venture that failed when a surging real estate market reversed course. This
was a circumstance largely beyond his control. He does not receive full credit in
mitigation, however, because he clearly overextended himself by using leverage to fund
the venture, which was a plan fraught with risk. I also considered AG ¶ 20(c) based on
Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Given that his bankruptcy case is at the initial
stages, it is too soon to tell if there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control. Finally, he receives some credit under AG ¶ 20(d) based on
payment of the tax lien. But he receives no credit based on the Chapter 7 bankruptcy
case because it is well-established law that taking such action does not amount to a
good-faith effort.
The evidence of Applicant’s problematic financial history, which is ongoing,
justifies current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following
Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting
national security. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and
considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable32
evidence, to include his many years of honorable military service. But Applicant is
currently in the middle of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case where he is seeking to discharge
nearly $900,000 in liabilities. Moreover, his bankruptcy case papers show he has a
negative monthly cash flow. Given all the circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if or
when Applicant will put his financial house in good order. Applicant did not meet his
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.g: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.h: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.i–1.n: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: Withdrawn
Subparagraph 2.a: Withdrawn

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
