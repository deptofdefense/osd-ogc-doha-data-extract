DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns raised by Applicant’s 
criminal charges in 1981 and 1987 were mitigated. Furthermore, Applicant did not 
deliberately falsify his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). 
However, doubts persist regarding his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness because 
of his 2004 criminal conduct. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 12, 2009. On July 13, 2011, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
detailing security concerns under Guidelines J and E. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue Applicant’s security clearance. In an undated response, Applicant answered 
the SOR. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2011. DOHA issued the Notice 
of Hearing on November 17, 2011. The hearing was held as scheduled on December 8, 
2011. Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 that were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called no witnesses, and offered no 
exhibits. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on December 22, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked as 
an electronic technician for that employer since November 2007. He served in the U.S. 
Navy from 1980 to 1984 and received an honorable discharge. He obtained his high 
school General Educational Development (GED) certificate while serving in the Navy. 
He is married and has a son who is 18 years old. He held an interim Secret security 
clearance.1 
 
The SOR alleged, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), that Applicant was 
charged with criminal offenses on three separate occasions. Specifically, he was 
charged with felony Assault and Battery with Intent to Kill, Having a Concealed Weapon, 
and Threatening a State Witness in 1981; Malicious Mischief in 1987; and Assault and 
Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature after engaging in criminal sexual conduct with 
a minor in 2004. In his Answer, he admitted that he was charged with the 1981 and 
1987 offenses. He also admitted that he was charged with Assault and Battery of a High 
and Aggravating Nature in 2004, but denied engaging in criminal sexual conduct with a 
minor. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. The SOR also cross-
alleged the three criminal conduct allegations in a single Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) allegation and separately alleged that he falsified his e-QIP by failing to 
disclose that he was charged with felony offenses in 1981. He denied the falsification 
allegation and did not respond to the Guideline E allegation that cross-alleged the 
criminal conduct.2 
 
1981 Criminal Charges 
 
In 1981, civilian authorities charged Applicant with Assault and Battery with Intent 
to Kill, Having a Concealed Weapon, and Threatening a State Witness. At that time, he 
was about 18 years old and was serving in the Navy. During this incident, he engaged 
in a fistfight with a fellow sailor because the sailor slighted one of his friends. The sailor 
claimed Applicant assaulted him with brass knuckles. However Applicant denied using 
any weapon or threatening the sailor and claimed the sailor blew the incident out of

proportion because Applicant got the better of him in the fight. Applicant stated that he 
was then unaware that the sailor was working with the local police in a drug case and 
that he had no involvement with the sailor’s drug activities. He denied having an intent 
to kill the sailor during the fight or causing him any permanent injury. These charges 
were dismissed when the sailor did not appear in court. At the security clearance 
hearing, Applicant indicated that the Navy may have awarded him 30 days restriction 
due to this incident, but he did not remember going to a nonjudicial punishment 
proceeding or court-martial for these offenses.3 
 
1987 Criminal Charge 
 
In 1987, Applicant and his then-girlfriend were planning to travel out of town 
together. For this trip, she intended to purchase a dress from a store, wear it during the 
trip, and later return it to the store for a refund. He purchased the dress for her. While 
wearing the dress, she got sick and soiled the dress. Because it was soiled, the store 
refused to accept it for return. He later went to her house to retrieve the dress, but she 
refused to give it to him. During this incident, he was banging loudly on the door and the 
police were called. Apparently, the bottom of the door was damaged, but Applicant 
claimed he did not kick or damage the bottom of the door. He was arrested and charged 
with Malicious Mischief. The charge was dismissed when she failed to appear in court.4 
 
2004 Criminal Charge 
 
In October 2004, Applicant was charged with Assault and Battery of a High and 
Aggravated Nature. On April 3, 2006, Applicant pled guilty to that charge and was 
awarded a suspended sentence of ten years imprisonment upon service of one year in 
prison and two years of probation. He served six months in prison before being placed 
on probation. He was released from probation in October 2008.5 
 
At the time of the offense, the female victim was 14 years old. On October 14, 
2004, the police interviewed the victim. The police report indicated:  
 
[Victim] stated that she attends [X] Middle School, where she is in the 8th 
grade. [Victim] stated that her mom and dad are divorced and she has a 
good relationship with both of her parents. [Victim] stated that she has 
known [Applicant’s family] since she was in [kindergarten], as they used to 
be her next door neighbors. [Victim] stated that she and [Applicant’s son] 
are best friends. [Victim] stated that on Sunday, August 29, 2004, she was 
at home with her mother and they lost power to their home due to the 
hurricane. [Victim] stated that her mom called [Applicant’s family] and

asked them if she could bring [her] over as [Applicant’s family] had not lost 
power. [Victim] stated that her mother dropped her off at [Applicant’s] 
residence . . . between 4:00 and 4:30 PM. [Victim] stated that [Applicant, 
his wife,] and their 11 year old son . . . were in the residence when she 
arrived. [Victim] stated that she and [Applicant’s son] played games and 
rode [his] bike. [Victim] stated that when she and [Applicant’s son] were on 
[his] bicycle, she burned her skin by her right ankle with the tire. [Victim] 
stated that when she and [Applicant’s son] went into the residence, they 
went to [the son’s] room where [Victim] was playing games on his TV. 
[Victim] stated that the burn on her leg was hurting and she picked up a 
small hand pump that is used to blow up balloons, and started to blow the 
air on her burn. [Victim] stated [Applicant] walked into the room and saw 
her blowing air on her leg and stated to her “give me a blow job.” [Victim] 
stated that she told [Applicant] that she did not think that he knew what 
that was, and he stated to her “I think I do” and walked out of the 
bedroom. [Victim] stated the only thing she knows as a blow job is “head.” 
[Victim] stated that she did not think too much of [Applicant’s] comment 
and went on playing games with [his son.] [Victim] stated that she did not 
think [the son] heard the comment as he did not react and he was playing 
a game.  
 
[Victim] stated that at night she, [Applicant’s son] and [Applicant] were in 
the master bedroom on the bed. [Victim] stated that she, [Applicant’s son] 
and [Applicant] were on the bed wrestling while [Applicant’s wife] was 
taking her shower. [Victim] stated that when [Applicant’s wife] finished her 
shower and came into the bedroom, they all settled down. [Victim] stated 
that [Applicant’s son] got tired and laid down on the bed and fell asleep. 
[Victim] stated that [Applicant’s wife] laid down next to [her son] and fell 
asleep as well. [Victim] stated that she laid down by [the son] and 
[Applicant] laid down next to her. [Victim] stated that she was laying on her 
side facing [Applicant’s son] and [his wife] and she could see that they 
were sleeping. [Victim] stated that she was wearing underwear, a bra, long 
pajama bottoms with shorts over them and a tank top. [Victim] stated that 
[Applicant] was wearing boxers, however, she does not remember what 
color they were. [Victim] stated that [Applicant’s] body was right up to her, 
touching her body. [Victim] stated that she felt [Applicant] kissing her on 
her neck and on her shoulder. [Victim] stated that she moved and he 
stopped. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] again started to kiss her on her 
neck and shoulder and did so approximately four times. [Victim] stated 
that [Applicant] did not say anything. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] then 
put his arm around her waist, put his hand underneath her shirt, touching 
her skin and started to move his hand up towards her breasts and she 
moved and he stopped. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] put his hand 
between her shorts and pajama bottoms, but his hand stayed in her waist 
area. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] removed his hand then put it in her 
pajamas but not in her underwear. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] then 
 
5 
 
 
rubbed her thigh, on her skin with his hand. [Victim] stated that she moved 
and [Applicant] stopped touching her. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] did 
not touch her breasts or her vagina. [Victim] stated that she got out of the 
bed and went to another bedroom.  
 
[Victim] stated that she went to the bathroom, that is located in the 
upstairs hallway, and when she opened the door, she found [Applicant] 
standing by the door, and he startled her. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] 
ask her if she could use another bedroom as he wanted to put [his son] in 
the bedroom that she had been in. [Victim] stated that she moved to the 
guest bedroom. [Victim] stated tha[t] she waited a little while, then she 
went downstairs and tried to call her mother. [Victim] stated that 
[Applicant] came downstairs and asked her what she was doing. [Victim] 
stated that she told [Applicant] that she was trying to call her mother. 
[Victim] stated that [Applicant] went back upstairs then came back down 
again and told her “I think what I did made you feel uncomfortable.” 
[Victim] stated that she said, “you think?” [Victim] stated that [Applicant] 
told her not to tell anyone because if she told, [Applicant’s wife] and [son] 
would not have a place to live. [Victim] stated that she told [Applicant] that 
she and her mother would take care of [Applicant’s wife] and [son]. 
[Victim] stated that [Applicant] asked her “what if you can’t?” [Victim] 
stated that she looked at the clock on the stove and it was displaying 1:50 
AM. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] told her he was overwhelmed by 
something, then he stated that he had not done this to [another specific 
child]. [Victim] stated that [this other child] is a 12 year old child that 
[Applicant’s wife] babysits for. [Victim] stated that she told [Applicant] that 
she was not sure if she was going to tell anyone and went upstairs. 
[Victim] stated that she went into the master bedroom and took the phone 
with her to her bedroom and locked the door. [Victim] stated that 
[Applicant] knocked on the bedroom door and told her he need[ed] the 
phone back. [Victim] stated that she opened the bedroom door and 
[Applicant] asked her “what do you mean, you don’t know if you are going 
to tell anyone?” [Victim] stated that [Applicant] then asked her “who would 
you tell?” [Victim] stated that she advised [Applicant] that she would tell 
her mom. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] asked her “why would you tell 
your mom, you know she will call the police?” [Victim] stated that she 
would tell her mother because she is her mother. [Victim] stated that 
[Applicant] again told her that [Applicant’s wife] and [son] would lose the 
house. [Victim] stated that [Applicant] told her that he was sorry and she 
told him that he needed to ask God for forgiveness not her. [Victim] stated 
that he told her that he already asked God for forgiveness. [Victim] stated 
that she closed the door and went to bed. [Victim] stated that she looked 
at the clock and it displayed 3:25 PM. [Victim] stated that she was 
sleeping when someone knocked on the bedroom door. [Victim] stated 
that it was [Applicant] and [his wife] that were at the door. [Victim] stated 
that [Applicant] told her that her mother was coming to get her and that he 
 
6 
 
 
had told [his wife] what had happened. [Victim] stated that she and 
[Applicant’s wife] hugged, but [Applicant’s wife] did not tell her what 
[Applicant] told her. [Victim] stated that she has not returned to 
[Applicant’s] residence.6  
 
 Applicant’s and the victim’s description of the assault are similar. He stated that 
he was underneath the covers on the bed and the victim was above the covers. He 
admitted to nibbling and kissing her on the neck and rubbing her side, hip, and thigh. He 
stated that she was wearing shorts during the assault and rubbed her bare thigh, but 
indicated that at no time did he touch her breasts, buttocks, or vagina. He admitted that 
his actions were wrongful. He stated that he touched her to gratify his sexual desires. 
When questioned by representatives of a social services agency at a later time, he lied 
to them about the incident. He told the representatives that the only physical contact he 
had with the victim was to wake her up by shaking her. He also initially lied to neighbors 
about this incident. Shortly thereafter, he came to believe that, if he continued with the 
lie, the Lord would take his son from him. He later told the neighbors that he lied to the 
representatives of the social services agency and the neighbors reported to that agency 
that he lied to them. The neighbor’s daughter, who Applicant’s wife had periodically 
babysat, underwent a forensic interview and disclosed that no one had touched her 
inappropriately.7  
 
 In his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, his Answer to the SOR, 
and his testimony, Applicant claimed that the victim later changed her version of the 
events by claiming that he cupped her breast. However, the police report does not 
reflect that the victim changed her statement. When he went to a court hearing, he 
believed that, if he did not plead guilty to the charged offense, the prosecutor would 
have also charged him with Lewd Act on a Minor. He also stated that the prosecutor told 
the judge that Applicant had cupped the victim’s breast.8 
 
 Applicant denied making any comment to the victim about oral sex when she was 
using the balloon pump. He stated that his son was present at the time and 
substantiated that he did not make such a comment.9  
 
                                                          
6 Tr. 50-51; GE 4. The names of the victim and Applicant’s son, who were both minors, were 
redacted from the police report. The words “victim” or “Applicant’s son” were inserted in the above 
quotation based on the context of the statement. The above quote was one paragraph; the paragraph 
breaks were added to assist the reader.  
7 Tr. 26-33, 45-48, 66-70; GE 2; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant stated that he did not engage in criminal sexual conduct with a minor because that offense 
required “some form of penetration with a minor.” He also stated he was charged with Assault and Battery 
of a High and Aggravating Nature because of disparity in age and size between him and the victim.

 At the hearing, Applicant testified that the charged offense was a misdemeanor. 
Department Counsel indicated the charged offense was a common law crime that later 
was amended substantially and could not confirm whether it was a felony at the time of 
the alleged offense. Applicant was initially registered as a sex offender. However, the 
court later removed him from the sex offender registry contingent on him receiving sex 
abuse counseling. Applicant completed nine months of sex abuse counseling for 
pedophiles. This counseling consisted of weekly sessions. He provided no professional 
assessment of his prognosis or the status of his rehabilitation. He is no longer 
registered as a sex offender. He was released early from prison due to good behavior 
and successfully completed his two years of probation. He expressed remorse for his 
2004 offense and called his actions heinous. He disclosed his misconduct to his church 
pastors and others at his church are aware of this offense.10 
 
Falsification Allegation 
 
 Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 12, 2009. In the police record section 
of the e-QIP, he disclosed his conviction for Assault and Battery of a High and 
Aggravated Nature and the sentence. In the comments to that section, he indicated that 
his attorney advised him that offense was a misdemeanor.11  
 
In that e-QIP, he did not disclose that he was charged with Assault and Battery 
with Intent to Kill, Having a Concealed Weapon, and Threatening a State Witness in 
1981. His FBI background report does not reflect the 1981 charges. In his Answer to the 
SOR, he indicated that his employer required him to submit his e-QIP two days before 
he was to travel overseas. He stated that he filled out the questionnaire from 7:00 pm to 
12:30 am one evening and that he misread the question in Section 23a to mean have 
you ever been “convicted” of a felony. During his subsequent OPM interview, he was 
asked whether he was ever charged with a felony offense and disclosed to the 
investigator his 1981 felony charges. He indicated that the investigator did not have any 
information about the 1981 charges until he provided her with the details.12 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant presented no reference letters or work performance evaluations. His 
wife was present at the hearing, but did not testify. His wife and son live with him. From 
2009 to 2010, he served six months in Kuwait (two separate three-month tours) and 
nine months in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he served in Helmand Province, where the 
fighting was fierce. While serving overseas, his responsibilities included installing 
electronic equipment in bomb-proof vehicles.13

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
 
9 
 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
Two disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG ¶ 31 are potentially 
applicable in this case: 
 
(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  
 
(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. 
 
 Applicant was charged with criminal offenses in 1981 and 1987. He also pled 
guilty to assaulting a minor female in 2004 when he touched her with the intent to gratify 
his sexual desires. The evidence establishes both of the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
 I have considered all of the mitigating conditions for Criminal Conduct under AG 
¶ 32. The potentially mitigating conditions are: 
 
 (a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment; 
 
(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and 
 
 (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited 
to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or 
restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement. 
 
 
10 
 
 
 The only record evidence pertaining to the 1981 felony charges is Applicant’s 
statements. This incident happened 30 years ago when he was 18 years old. He stated 
that this was a fistfight that he had with another sailor over a personal slight to a friend. 
He indicated that he did not use a weapon during the assault and the other sailor was 
not permanently injured. Civilian authorities dismissed the charges against him. He 
believed the Navy may have awarded him 30 days restriction for this matter, which is a 
minor punishment. AG ¶ 32(a) applies to the 1981 charges. 
 
 The Malicious Mischief charge in 1987 was for a minor offense. This incident 
happened 25 years ago when he was 24 years old. The charges were dropped when 
the complainant did not appear in court. AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(c) apply to the 1987 
charge.  
 
 The Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravating Nature in 2004 was a serious 
offense. This incident happened seven years ago when Applicant was 41 years old. 
During this assault, he touched a 14-year-old girl on her stomach, side, hip, and thigh 
with the intent to gratify his sexual desire. The girl stopped his advances. At the time of 
that offense, he was serving in loco parentis to the girl. By engaging in that misconduct, 
he violated the trust and confidence the victim’s mother placed in him. He initially lied to 
social service representatives and neighbors about this misconduct, but eventually 
confessed to the neighbors. Approximately a year-and-a-half after committing the 
offense, he pled guilty to the charged offense and was awarded a suspended sentence 
of ten years imprisonment upon service of one year in prison and two years of 
probation. He was released early from prison for good behavior and received sex abuse 
counseling. He provided no professional assessment of the status of his rehabilitation. 
He completed his probation in October 2008 and has only been removed from the 
court’s supervision for a little over three years. He has accepted responsibility for his 
misconduct and taken the first steps towards rehabilitation. Nevertheless, given the 
nature and seriousness of this offense, I find that insufficient time has passed to 
conclude that Applicant’s misconduct is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) do not 
apply to the Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature offense.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
 
 
11 
 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; 
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as 
(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s 
personal, professional, or community standing . . . .  
 
In submitting his e-QIP in January 2009, Applicant disclosed his conviction for 
Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravating Nature. In responding to Section 23a of 
the e-QIP, however, he did not disclose that he was charged with felony offenses, i.e., 
Assault and Battery with Intent to Kill, Having a Concealed Weapon, and Threatening a 
State Witness, in 1981. He was given only a couple of days to complete the e-QIP 
before going on a business trip. He filled out the application late one evening and 
misinterpreted Section 23a. He thought the question requested disclosure of felony 
convictions, instead of felony charges. When asked during his OPM interview whether 
he had ever been charged with a felony, he disclosed the 1981 charges even though 
the investigator had no knowledge of those charges. I find that Applicant did not 
intentionally falsify his response to Section 23a, but misinterpreted that question. Such a 
misinterpretation does not equate to intentional falsification. AG ¶ 16(a) is not 
applicable. I find for Applicant on the falsification allegation (SOR ¶ 2.b). 
 
As for SOR ¶ 2.a, AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) apply to Applicant’s criminal conduct as 
set forth above in the Analysis section of Guideline J.14 
 
AG ¶ 17 lists three personal conduct mitigating conditions that are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
                                                          
14 The SOR did not allege that Applicant provided false or misleading information to the 
representatives of the social service agency. Consequently, his false statements to them will not be 
considered for applying the disqualifying conditions, but will be considered in assessing his credibility and 
in applying the whole-person concept.  
 
12 
 
 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
For the reason set forth in the Analysis section under Guideline J, Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E for the 1981 and 1987 criminal 
charges, but has not done so for his 2004 offense. AG ¶17(c) does not apply to the 
2004 offense. However, because Applicant has informed his pastor of the 2004 offense 
and others are aware of that offense, he has eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation. 
While AG ¶ 17(e) applies, the 2004 offense remains a security concern. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case and examined all of Applicant’s 
alleged wrongdoing as a whole. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J 
and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed 
under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant served in the 
Navy from 1980 to 1984 and received an honorable discharge. He worked in Kuwait 
and Afghanistan in support of U.S. forces in 2009 and 2010. Nevertheless, Applicant 
committed a serious offense in 2004. He lied to social service representatives about that 
 
13 
 
 
offense. He was released from probation for that offense in October 2008. Sufficient 
time has not passed to conclude that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and will not 
engage in future misconduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions 
and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the Criminal Conduct and 
Personal Conduct guidelines for his 2004 offense. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline J:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.b:   For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
