HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges that he owed the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) $38,135 for tax year 2006, and he failed to file his federal and 
state tax returns in 2008, 2009, and 2010. His accountant failed to file Applicant’s tax 
returns as promised. Applicant paid the 2006 tax lien and filed his 2008-2010 tax returns 
in 2012, resolving all SOR allegations. He paid all of his state tax debts, and made a 
substantial, good-faith payment to address his federal tax debt. Financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 20, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
March 21, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for 
a determination whether his clearance should be continued or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On May 2, 2012, DOHA received Applicant’s response to the SOR, and he 
requested a hearing. (HE 3) On July 31, 2012, Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On August 6, 2012, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to 
me. On August 14, 2012, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for 
September 6, 2012. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant did not offer any exhibits. (Tr. 
14-15; GE 1-5) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5. (Tr. 15) On 
September 13, 2012, I received the transcript of the hearing. I held the record open until 
December 17, 2012, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation. (Tr. 69, 
73-74; AE J) Applicant provided ten post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted without 
objection.  (AE A-J).     
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations, and 
he provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of 
fact.  
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old attorney, who was admitted to practice law in 1990.2 
(Tr. 17-18; SOR response at 5) He served in the Marine Corps from 1980 to 1986 and 
received an Honorable discharge as a sergeant. (Tr. 89-90; SOR response) He 
graduated from law school and received a Juris Doctor degree in 1988. He married in 
1986 and divorced in 2006. (Tr. 20) His children were born in 1987, 1990, 1992, and 
1993. Applicant married his spouse in 2010. (Tr. 23) His stepchildren from his current 
marriage were born in 2003 and 2005. His spouse is a paralegal, and she works for 
Applicant. (Tr. 24) He has been self-employed in a small legal office since 1990.  He is 
sponsored for a security clearance to enable him to act as counsel for a government 
contractor. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In July 2006, Applicant moved out of his residence. (Tr. 32) His former spouse 
worked with his bookkeeper on the firm’s finances. (Tr. 32, 36) His 2006 divorce caused 
financial problems. Applicant was required to make monthly payments to his former 
spouse of $3,000 in maintenance and $750 in child support. (Tr. 20) Applicant paid his 
office expenses and his court-ordered support to his former spouse. (Tr. 21) Applicant’s 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
2The information in this paragraph is from Applicant’s SF 86, unless stated otherwise. (GE 1)

legal practice involved representation of defendants in federal court, and the federal 
court payments to Applicant were late, sometimes a year after the services were 
provided. (Tr. 21-22) In 2009, Applicant received a substantial payment of attorney fees, 
and he used that payment to resolve many of his debts. (Tr. 23) 
  
In December 2008, the IRS filed a $27,911 federal tax lien against Applicant. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant disclosed the tax lien on his June 20, 2011 SF 86. (GE 1) By 
February 2012, he owed the IRS $38,135 for tax year 2006. (SOR ¶ 1.a) On February 
21, 2012, he paid off the 2006 tax lien, and he provided a copy of the $39,000 check to 
the IRS. (Tr. 38; SOR response at page 3; GE 4 at Tab 27)  
 
Applicant admitted that he failed to file his federal and state tax returns in 2008, 
2009, and 2010. (SOR ¶ 1.b; SOR response at page 3) Applicant’s Certified Public 
Accountant (CPA) AB had been doing Applicant’s taxes for about 15 years. (Tr. 25; 
SOR response at 3) In 2008, CPA AB had open heart surgery, and he was 
incapacitated for a lengthy period afterwards. (Tr. 26, 55) He is still suffering from 
medical difficulties. (Tr. 55) CPA AB provided a bookkeeper who worked closely with 
Applicant’s staff. (Tr. 26) When Applicant asked for the status of his taxes, CPA AB and 
CPA AB’s bookkeeper told him they had approved extensions from the IRS. (Tr. 27) 
CPA AB told Applicant he had filed Applicant’s tax returns and provided electronic 
copies. (Tr. 27, 42, 48; SOR response at 3; GE 4 at Tabs 29-32) The 2008 tax return 
showed a $55,678 tax debt; the 2009 tax return showed no tax debt; and the 2010 tax 
return showed a $5,708 tax debt. (Tr. 39, 49; GE 4 at Tabs 29-32) 
 
In February 2012, Applicant obtained transcripts of his tax filings from the IRS. 
(Tr. 28-29) He was “astounded” to discover that his tax returns were not filed in 2008, 
2009, and 2010. (Tr. 28, 37; GE 4, Tab 28) He stressed to CPA AB the urgent necessity 
of getting his tax returns filed, and CPA AB did file his tax returns in March or April of 
2012. (Tr. 29, 41; GE 4, Tabs 29-31; AE C-G) He subsequently learned that CPA AB 
and his bookkeeper failed to file the tax returns of at least three other people. (Tr. 29-30, 
71-73)  
 
Applicant hired two new accountants with excellent credentials to determine his 
tax liability for 2008-2011. (Tr. 51-52, 66-68) They found significant errors in CPA AB’s 
work. (Tr. 30, 53-54, 68-69) CPA AB duplicated income by counting both invoices and 
deposits. (Tr. 61) CPA AB counted an entire settlement as income and failed to reduce 
the income to the fee Applicant received. (Tr. 62, 70) Applicant and his new accountants 
believed Applicant’s tax returns showed a substantial overstatement of income in tax 
year 2008 and a large understatement of income in 2009. (Tr. 40-41, 54-63, 69-77) 
Applicant’s new accountant discussed the problematic tax returns with an IRS agent. 
(Tr. 58) His new accountant believed the IRS would mitigate the IRS penalties because 
Applicant acted in good faith and the fault was primarily due to CPA AB’s negligence. 
(Tr. 79)  
 
Applicant provided copies of his tax returns filed in February 2012. (Tr. 43-44, 47; 
AE D) Applicant’s business is healthy and profitable, and he will be able to pay his IRS 
debt. (Tr. 59-60) Aside from his IRS and state tax issues, Applicant did not have any 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
other delinquent debts. There are no allegations that he has abused his trust funds or 
client accounts.  
 
On November 16, 2012, Applicant filed amended tax returns. (AE C-H) 
Applicant’s original and amended federal and state tax returns for 2008 to 2011 (AE C-
G) are summarized as follows: 
 
 Original State 
Owed 
Amended 
State  
Original 
Federal Owed 
Amended 
Federal Owed 
2008 $10,534 $792 $55,678 $11,586 
2009 $0 $6,928 $0 $39,002 
2010 $0 $0 $5,708 $5,708 
2011 not filed  $4,319 not filed $19,841 
Total $10,534 $12,039  $61,386  $76,137 
 
On December 17, 2012, Applicant paid the IRS $21,004 and the state tax 
authority $12,045. (AE J)  These payments were in addition to the $39,000 payment on 
February 21, 2012 (to pay off the 2006 IRS tax lien). Applicant’s state tax debts are 
paid.      
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant has been admitted to practice before several state and federal courts 
since 1990. (Tr. 18-19; SOR response at 5) He has tried numerous jury trials and 
argued appeals in state and federal courts. (SOR response at 5) He is responsible, 
reliable, dedicated, and diligent. (Tr. 84-86) He conscientiously and assiduously protects 
classified information. (Tr. 19-20, 83-87) His security manager described an instance 
where Applicant showed initiative in safeguarding classified information that was 
compromised by a party during litigation. (Tr. 82)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or] her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the 
same.”  
 
Applicant’s financial history is documented in his SF 86, his SOR response, his 
statement at his hearing, and his hearing exhibits. Applicant failed to pay sufficient taxes 
in 2006. In December 2008, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for 
$27,911. By 2012, that 2006 tax debt had increased to $38,135. He failed to file federal 
and state tax returns in 2008, 2009, and 2010 until 2012. The Government established 
the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry 
about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his financial issues warrants full application of 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b). Applicant’s divorce, delays in payments from the federal courts, 
and his accountant’s negligence had a profoundly negative affect on his financial 
circumstances and caused the delinquent tax debt and failure to timely file accurate tax 
returns. His financial problems were generated by circumstances largely beyond his 
control. There is no evidence that he acted irresponsibly.    
 
The Applicant used his limited resources to resolve his 2006 tax debt, and he 
took reasonable actions to effectuate that plan. Applicant took all reasonable actions to 
rectify his financial condition.  On February 21, 2012, he paid the IRS $39,000, paying 
off the 2006 IRS tax lien. On December 17, 2012, Applicant paid the IRS $21,004 and 
the state tax authority $12,045, resolving his state tax debts. His payment of $21,004 is 
a substantial, good-faith payment to address his $76,137 federal tax debt.      
 
 Application of AG ¶ 20(c) is warranted. Applicant does not require formal financial 
counseling, as he understands what he must do to establish and maintain his financial 
responsibility. He utilizes highly-qualified accountants to ensure compliance with the tax 
laws. He maintained contact with his creditors,3 and his financial problem is being 
resolved and is under control.   
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his financial problems, showing good 
faith.4 AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable.      
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on his federal taxes primarily because of his divorce 
and delays in receipt of federal court payments. CPA AB misled Applicant about filing 
                                            
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

his tax returns and made significant errors in his tax returns. Applicant paid the federal 
tax lien. When he discovered that CPA AB was untrustworthy, he replaced him with a 
competent CPA and re-filed Applicant’s taxes. He filed amended returns and paid his 
state tax debts. He has paid the IRS more than $60,000 in 2012 to address his tax 
debts. It is unlikely that such problems will recur. His efforts are sufficient to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Assuming, financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security concerns are mitigated under the 
whole-person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 50 years old. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with 
his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support 
the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor, and for his U.S. Marine Corps 
service from 1980 to 1986. His security manager provided evidence supporting approval 
of his access to classified information. There is every indication that he is loyal to the 
United States, his employer, and his clients. There is no evidence that he abuses 
alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His divorce, delays in payments from the federal courts, 
and CPA AB’s negligence contributed to his financial woes. I give Applicant substantial 
credit for admitting responsibility for his federal tax lien in his SF 86, responses to 
DOHA interrogatories, and at his hearing.  
 
Even though Applicant lacked financial resources because of his high 
maintenance payments to his former spouse, Applicant paid his state tax debt, and 
made a substantial, good-faith payment of over $60,000 to resolve his federal tax debts. 
His actions to correct his tax records are appropriate and reasonable. The Appeal Board 
has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands how to budget and what 
he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. There is simply no 
reason not to trust him. Moreover, aside from his recent issues with his federal and 
state taxes, his finances were excellent. Those issues were due to the negligence of his 
accountants. Now that he has corrected his income tax returns, paid his state tax debt, 
and made a substantial, good-faith payment to the IRS, there is no reason to deny his 
security clearance. He has established a “meaningful track record” of debt repayment. I 
am confident he will fully pay his taxes and maintain his financial responsibility.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
