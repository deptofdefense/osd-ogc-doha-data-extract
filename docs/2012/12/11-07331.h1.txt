Decision
______________
METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant’s clearance.1
On 22 June 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guidelines F,
Financial Considerations, and E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the2
SOR, requesting a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 27 July 2012, and I
convened a hearing 21 August 2012. DOHA received the transcript 29 August 2012.
 
However, Applicant’s documents (GE 2) show that Applicant had paid that debt in February 2012, before the3
SOR was issued.

Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted the financial allegations of SOR 1.a and 1.e-1.g; he denied
the financial allegations of SOR 1.b-1.d. He admitted the falsification allegations of SOR
2.a-1.d. He is a 43-year-old truck driver employed by a defense contractor since March
2011. He has not previously held a clearance. He was married briefly in the 1980s and
has two adult children.
In his March 2011 clearance application (GE 1), Applicant answered “no” to a
series of questions requiring him to disclose any recent financial problems. At the time,
Applicant had been underemployed for some time, and had been looking for a better job
since the end of 2008. He knew that he had financial problems, but feared he would not
keep his job or get his clearance if he disclosed them (Tr. 65-68). Consequently,
Applicant failed to disclose that he had not filed his state and Federal income tax returns
as required (SOR 2.a), that he had a lien placed on his property for not paying taxes
(SOR 2.b), that he had delinquent Federal debt (SOR 2.c), and that he had been 180-
days delinquent on some debts, and was currently 90-days delinquent on others (SOR
2.d).
Applicant failed to file his state income tax returns for tax years 2007 through
2010 (SOR 1.a) and failed to file his Federal income tax returns for 2007, 2008, and
2010 (SOR 1.b). Consequently, Applicant owed about $11,000 unpaid state income
taxes (SOR 1.c), had an October 2010 Federal tax lien of over $9,000 (SOR 1.e), and
still owed about $5,000 unpaid Federal income taxes (SOR 1.f). He also owed about
$2,200 unpaid state property taxes (SOR 1.d)  and was about $7,000 in arrears on his3
first mortgage (SOR 1.g).
From June 1998 to February 2011, Applicant ran his own for-hire trucking
company. He was the sole owner and employee of the company; his equipment
consisted of one dump truck. The work was seasonal: lots of work in spring, summer,
and fall; very little work during the winter. He supplemented his income by renting rooms
in his house. He appears to have not made quarterly payments to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) as required, which would have lessened the potential impact on the
amount of Federal income tax liability owed every year.
By 2007, Applicant’s finances began to tighten up. In addition to the normal
winter lull in work, the overall decline in the economy was reducing the amount of work
during the busy seasons. His finances were further complicated by child-support issues
with his ex-wife as well as a custody battle over his minor daughter.
Applicant filed his 2007 Federal income tax return on time, but was unable to pay
his nearly $8,500 tax liability, and made no arrangements with the IRS to begin a
payment plan. He did not file his 2007 state income tax return at all because he wanted
3
to resolve his IRS debt before addressing the state income tax. Applicant filed his 2008
Federal income tax return in October 2009 (apparently with an extension of time to file
from the IRS), but was again unable to pay his nearly $3,200 tax liability, and again
made no arrangements with the IRS to begin a payment plan. He again did not file his
2008 state income tax return at all because he wanted to resolve his IRS debt before
addressing the state income tax. In all, Applicant failed to file his state income tax
returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
In October 2010, the IRS filed a nearly $9,200 income tax lien on Applicant,
which finally spurred him to contact the IRS to address his tax debts. In December
2010, the IRS accepted Applicant’s proposed installment agreement, with the first $153-
per-month payment due by mid-January 2011. In addition, in December 2010, the IRS
seized Applicant’s 2009 income tax refund (on a return timely filed, with extension, in
August 2010). In May 2012, the IRS also seized Applicant’s 2011 income tax refund.
Applicant owed taxes for 2010, but the record does not show if Applicant paid that debt
or not. Nor are there any records showing any IRS action for 2010.
Applicant did not begin making payments as required in January 2011, but
apparently had his 2010 agreement reinstated at some point. The record does not
reflect when Applicant actually began to make payments, but a May 2012 IRS letter
confirmed receipt of the March 2012 payment, which reduced his outstanding balance
to just under $4,900. Applicant documented all the required monthly payments from
April to August 2012.   
Applicant filed his 2007 and 2009 state income tax returns in December 2010. He
filed his 2010 state income tax return in December 2011, and he filed his 2007 state
income tax return in March 2012. His total tax liability, as reported, was about $3,500
before penalties, interest, and other fees. 
Applicant’s state tax records are less clear than his IRS records. A state
“Payment Arrangement Coupon” dated 5 April 2012 reflects an agreement to make the
first of 13 $160-monthly payments on 16 April 2012, against a stated balance of
$10,751.85. The coupon does not show how that number was reached, or for what tax
years it applies. A state “Application of Refund or Lottery Payment” dated 8 May 2012
reflects the state’s seizure of Applicant’s 2011 refund of $110, reducing an outstanding
2008 balance to $9,325.84. A state “Notice of Assessment” dated 24 May 2012 showed
tax, penalty, interest, and other fees totaling $2,218.90 for 2008. A 6 June 2012
“Payment Arrangement Coupon” reflects a reminder to make the third of 13 payments
on 16 June 2012, against a balance of $1,052.26. Absent any state records showing
how these numbers have been calculated, I conclude that this balance must be a
typographical error. The stated 13 payments total just over $2,000, an amount
inadequate to cover Applicant’s own estimate of his state tax liability. Nevertheless,
Applicant’s records show that he has made the required $160 payments from April to
August 2012.
4
Applicant also began to have trouble meeting his mortgage payment sometime in
2010. By July 2010, he was one-month behind on his mortgage. He continued to make
payments, but remained one-month behind through October 2010. He was working with
his lender to modify his mortgage, but received conflicting instructions about what he
had to do to qualify for a modification. From December 2010 to September 2011, he
paid the lender between $600 and $760 per month as instructed. However, he was then
told that he could not qualify for a modification unless his mortgage was current. In
October 2011, Applicant began the first of 24 $1,453.96-monthly payments required to
rehabilitate his mortgage. Applicant documented 11 required payments through August
2012 with a customer account activity statement and money-order receipts. However,
there is some confusion in the documents submitted in Applicant’s response to DOHA
interrogatories (GE 2). A 16 April 2012 letter from the lender states a past-due balance
as of the date of the letter. But the letter purports to schedule the first payment for
October 2012, later states that the first payment is due in May 2012, but then sets out a
repayment chart showing 24 payments beginning October 2011 and ending September
2013. Finally, Applicant’s signature page accepting some agreement is dated 8
September 2011, consistent with when Applicant actually began making payments, and
with the repayment chart, but not with any of the body of the letter.
Applicant submitted no work or character evidence. He has a budget that
accounts for his monthly payments as listed above, but with little cushion. Nevertheless,
he hopes to sell his dump truck in the near future, which would improve his cash
situation considerably. 
 
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and
Guideline E (Personal Conduct).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, applicant bears a heavy burden of
persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a

compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, but
Applicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant’s three outstanding debts have
repayment plans, and Applicant has been making the required monthly payments since
before the SOR was issued.5
The mitigating factors for financial considerations have mixed applicability. His
financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and occurred under circumstances that
could recur.  The debts did not occur largely under circumstances beyond his control.6
He certainly controlled whether he filed his income tax returns on time or contacted tax
authorities to arrange payment schedules. And, at least initially, he did not act
responsibly in addressing his debts.  He was only spurred to action when the IRS filed a7
tax lien on him in October 2010. That said, since October 2010, he has acted
responsibly to address his debts. While he has received no credit or financial
counseling, he has demonstrated that his financial problems are under control, and that
he is working a plan to bring them under control.  While his records are not a model of8
clarity, and there are some inconsistencies in his documents, he has made a good-faith
effort to satisfy his debts. He has been making catch-up payments on his mortgage
since October 2011, and has been paying on his state and Federal tax debts since at
least April 2012—all dates before the SOR was issued.  Accordingly, I conclude9
Guideline F for Applicant.
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and
Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicants are expected to give full and
frank answers during the clearance process. Although Applicant failed to report any
financial problems, he was aware of his delinquent mortgage and his state and Federal

¶ 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification11
before being confronted with the facts;
6
tax problems. This conduct constitutes a deliberate omission or evasiveness
inconsistent with the candor required of applicants.  10
None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information
was relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose this adverse information
until his subject interview, and then apparently only when confronted by the
investigator.  Applicant’s failure to disclose this information demonstrates a lack of11
candor required of cleared personnel, particularly with his background as a Government
security specialist. The Government has an interest in examining all relevant and
material adverse information about an applicant before making a clearance decision.
The Government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a
timely fashion, not when they perceive disclosure to be prudent or convenient. Further,
an applicant’s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some
indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security
concerns in the future, something the Government relies on to perform damage
assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant’s conduct
suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate Government
interests. Applicant provided no information to support a favorable assessment under a
“whole-person” analysis. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
