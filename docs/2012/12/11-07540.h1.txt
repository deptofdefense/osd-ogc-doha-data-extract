HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges three delinquent debts, totaling 
$10,748. Unemployment and other circumstances beyond his control caused him to 
have delinquent debts. He paid two SOR debts and has made an offer to settle the third 
debt. He had insufficient financial resources to make more financial progress. Financial 
considerations are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 18, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
July 20, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for 
a determination whether his clearance should be continued or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On September 14, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On October 31, 2012, Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
Applicant’s case. On November 5, 2012, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On 
November 13, 2012, Applicant was notified by telephone that his hearing would be on 
November 28, 2012; however, the location of the hearing was unspecified. (Tr. 16) On 
November 26, 2012, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for November 
28, 2012, and providing the location of the hearing. (HE 1) Applicant waived his right to 
15 days of notice of the date, time and location of his hearing. (Tr. 17) Applicant’s 
hearing was held on November 28, 2012, as scheduled using video teleconference. (Tr. 
4) At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant offered five 
exhibits. (Tr. 21-26; GE 1-5; AE A-E) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 
and AE A-E. (Tr. 25-26) On November 28, 2012, Applicant provided two post-hearing 
exhibits, which were admitted without objection.  (Tr. 18; AE F, G) On December 6, 
2012, I received the transcript of the hearing.     
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant accepted responsibility for the three debts 
listed in the SOR, and provided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) His 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old systems administrator, and he seeks employment with 
a defense contractor. (Tr. 6; GE 1) He received a graduate equivalency diploma (GED) 
in 1983 or 1984, and he has about 18 college credits. (Tr. 6-7) He has significant on-
the-job experience in information technology systems. (GE 1) He married in 1983 and 
divorced in 2010. (Tr. 36, 40) His two children are ages 29 and 33 years old. (Tr. 40, 75) 
He has never served in the military. (Tr. 7) He has never worked for the federal 
government. (Tr. 7) A defense contractor intends to hire him, if he is able to obtain a 
security clearance. (Tr. 8, 32-33)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SF 86, credit reports, SOR, and Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) consistently describe his three delinquent SOR 
debts, totaling $10,748 and financial history. (GE 1-5, AE A-E) Applicant owed the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $10,362 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and two medical debts for $304 
and $82 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c). In September 2012, he paid the two medical debts using 
money orders. (Tr. 22-23, 79; AE A, B) His May 5, 2012 credit report shows 11 
accounts as “Current; Paid or Paying as Agreed.” (GE 3)   
 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

In August of 2000, Applicant was severely injured in a fall, and he broke 
numerous bones. (Tr. 27, 34, 55-56) Applicant’s spouse took care of the family finances 
for several years, especially while Applicant was recuperating. (Tr. 28) His spouse was 
diagnosed with severe bi-polar disease, which included delusional episodes. (Tr. 28)2 
Her family had a history of mental problems, and her father had severe mental illness 
which resulted in a lengthy period of inpatient treatment. (Tr. 37) In 2004, their 
nonpriority, unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
(Tr. 65) Over the last 10 or 11 years, Applicant was employed for only six months in 
2005-2006. (Tr. 28, 75-76) His wife lost her employment at a hospital, and her employer 
obtained a court order of commitment because of her bi-polar disease. (Tr. 28) 
 
In 2000, Applicant was making a good income. (Tr. 29) In 2001, his spouse failed 
to file their tax return. (Tr. 28) They filed joint tax returns. (Tr. 41) In 2008, Applicant 
learned of the family tax problem relating to tax years 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2006, 
when he received an IRS tax lien in the mail. (Tr. 29, 35, 40-42, 44, 47, 56)   
 
In May 2012, Applicant obtained account transcripts from 2000 to present from 
the IRS. (Tr. 54-55; GE 4 at 70 to 111) The interest he owed the IRS for each tax year 
was calculated as of May 2012. (GE 4 at 70-111) In 2000, Applicant and his spouse 
owed the IRS $1,173 in taxes and $1,793 in interest. (GE 4 at 72) In 2001, they owed 
the IRS $6,423 in taxes and $3,959 in interest. (GE 4 at 75) In 2004, they owed the IRS 
$1,549 in taxes and $476 in interest. (GE 4 at 81) In 2006, they owed the IRS $493 in 
taxes and $81 in interest. (AG 4 at 87) The IRS applied calculated refunds for 2007, 
2008, and 2009 to pay the IRS debt for 2000 in full, and had a small remainder, which 
was applied to tax year 2001. (GE 4 at 74) 
  
In 2008, Applicant sought tax advice and was advised to wait. (Tr. 29) In 2009, 
Applicant’s spouse had an extremely manic episode and disappeared with the family 
financial records. (Tr. 29, 37, 48) She filed for divorce to give him protection from the 
debts she generated while in a manic episode, and their divorce was final in February 
2010. (Tr. 39-40) She died of a massive stroke less than a month after their divorce was 
final. (Tr. 40, 57-58) In addition to his spouse’s medical problems, his father was 
diagnosed with cancer, and he died in March 2011. (Tr. 49)  
 
Applicant went to the Office of the Tax Advocate in his state and sought advice 
on resolution of his federal income taxes. (Tr. 42) That office suggested he file for 
uncollectible status. (Tr. 48) His IRS case was processed through an administrative 
appeal, including review by an administrative judge. (Tr. 30, 42) On September 11, 
2012, the IRS Appeal was completed, and Applicant’s lien was affirmed. (AE G)   
 
                                            
2Applicant’s son corroborated Applicant’s statement that Applicant’s spouse was the source of the 
family financial difficulties. (Tr. 69, 72-73) He observed his mother’s erratic and unstable behavior, 
especially when she was not taking her medication. (Tr. 73) A family friend provided additional 
corroboration of Applicant’s description of his spouse’s mental problems and the damage she caused to 
Applicant’s financial circumstances. (AE F)

Applicant provided an October 25, 2012 IRS Form 433-1, Collection Information 
Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals, which is used to assess a 
taxpayers ability to pay a tax debt, and an IRS Form 656, Offer in Compromise. (Tr. 49-
50; AE D, E) On November 16, 2012, Applicant sent these forms to the IRS. (AE A) 
Applicant’s IRS administrative judge suggested that Applicant offer $200 to resolve his 
tax debt because of his very low income, and he offered the IRS $200. (Tr. 44-45, 58) 
His offer is currently under review. (Tr. 45)    
 
Applicant’s only source of income is Social Security disability. (AE A at 5) He 
applied for Social Security disability in 2001, and it was approved in 2004. (Tr. 62) In 
January 2012, Applicant’s 2001 tax debt will be collection barred due to the federal 10-
year-statute of limitations for personal income taxes. (Tr. 44, 56, 58-59) This statute of 
limitation collection bar arises in January 2013 because of when his spouse filed their 
2001 tax return. (Tr. 44, 56, 58-59)  
 
Applicant is totally disabled and his sole income is his monthly Social Security 
disability check for $1,220. (Tr. 50; AE A at 5) His doctor recommended he not return to 
the labor force because of stress related to his relationship with his spouse. (Tr. 62) His 
spouse ran up some joint credit cards to about $7,500, and he made payments and 
reduced his credit card debt to about $1,500. (Tr. 50-51; GE 3) He drives a 2002 Dodge 
Caravan. (Tr. 52) He understands the necessity of paying his bills; however, he has not 
received financial counseling. (Tr. 84-85) If Applicant receives employment from a 
government contractor, he promised to pay his IRS tax debt as soon as possible.  (Tr. 
30-31, 46, 79) He prefers to pay his taxes, as opposed to having his tax debt resolved 
through the statute of limitations. (Tr. 44) After learning of the tax lien in 2008, he filed 
his own tax returns, or his income was so low that he was not legally required to file a 
tax return. (Tr. 53-54; GE 4) Applicant emphasized that he loves to work and wants to 
return to the labor force as soon as possible. (Tr. 62, 78) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s son is a technical sergeant in the Air National Guard with seven years 
of active service. (Tr. 74) His son is married, and he has a two-year-old son. (Tr. 72) 
Applicant is a reliable, responsible, and trustworthy person. (Tr. 70-71) He is confident 
Applicant will pay his debts once he secures employment. (Tr. 71)  
 
An employee of a defense contractor has known Applicant for decades.3 He 
describes Applicant as having high character and strong moral values. Applicant can 
make “immeasurable” contributions to the “defense contracting world.”   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or designee to grant 
applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or] her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 
86, credit reports, his OPM interview, his SOR response, and his statement at his 
hearing. His debts became delinquent beginning in 2000 and continued to be delinquent 
to the present. In 2004, his unsecured, nonpriority debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His SOR alleges three delinquent debts, totaling 
$10,748. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Applicant and his spouse’s unemployment, his medical problems, her mental 
problems, their divorce, her death, and his father’s death had a profoundly negative 
effect on his financial circumstances and caused the SOR debts to become delinquent. 
His debts resulted from his spouse’s conduct, and with her passing, his financial 
problems “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” He paid 
his taxes for 2000 and two small medical debts. He paid other debts that his spouse 
generated during their marriage. His May 5, 2012 credit report shows 11 accounts as 
“Current; Paid or Paying as Agreed.” I do not believe he will have new delinquent debt 
after he becomes reemployed, and he promised to pay his tax debts. His financial 
problems were generated by circumstances such as illness, unemployment, and death 
of his former spouse and father, which are circumstances largely beyond his control. 
There is no evidence that he acted irresponsibly.    
 
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the Applicant had $41,000 in delinquent 
credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. 
Id. at 2. She filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her 
decision. Id. at 1-2. The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, 
had been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former 
husband was inconsistent in his payment of child support. The Appeal Board 
determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that 
Applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative Judge’s decision was 
issued. The Appeal Board also decided that the record evidence raised the applicability 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence4 of irresponsible behavior, poor 
judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
  
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an Applicant, who had been sporadically 
unemployed and lacked the ability to pay her creditors, noting that “it will be a long time 
at best before he has paid” all of her creditors. The Applicant was living on 
unemployment compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained 
that such a circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  The Applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that Applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not “responsible” in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
 Application of AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully warranted. Although Applicant did not 
complete financial counseling, there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control. He established and maintained contact with his creditors;5 
he paid two SOR debts; he paid or is paying 11 non-SOR debts; and he will pay his IRS 
debt once he obtains employment.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and is 
taking reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, showing some

to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

good faith.6 AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Applicant did not dispute any of his delinquent 
SOR debts.    
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts primarily because of his and his 
spouse’s unemployment, his medical problems, her mental problems, her mental-
health-related failure to fully pay their federal income taxes, their divorce, her death, and 
his father’s death. He paid two small medical SOR debts. He promised to pay his 
remaining tax debt once he becomes employed. It is unlikely that such problems will 
recur. His efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. Assuming, financial considerations concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 
20, security concerns are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
                                            
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant is 57 years old. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with 
his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support 
the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor. Two character witnesses 
provided evidence supporting approval of his access to classified information. There is 
every indication that he is loyal to the United States. There is no evidence that he 
abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His and his spouse’s unemployment, his medical 
problems, her mental problems, her failure to pay their federal income taxes, their 
divorce, her death, and his father’s death contributed to his financial woes. I give 
Applicant substantial credit for admitting responsibility for his delinquent debts in his SF 
86, OPM PSI, responses to DOHA interrogatories, SOR response, and at his hearing.  
 
Even though Applicant lacked financial resources, Applicant paid two medical 
SOR debts. His sole income for the last several years has been his Social Security 
disability payments of about $14,000 per year. His actions were appropriate and 
reasonable. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person 
analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands what he needs to do to 
establish and maintain his financial responsibility. There is simply no reason not to trust 
him. His most recent credit report shows 11 current or paid debts. It will list two more 
paid debts when the creditor for the two medical SOR debts credits him for making 
payments. He established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment. I am 
confident he will maintain his financial responsibility.7   
                                            
7Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
