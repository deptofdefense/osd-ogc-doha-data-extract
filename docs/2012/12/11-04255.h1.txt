FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on November 6, 2006. On 
May 2, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified him that it 
was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information, and it recommended that his case be 
submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to grant or deny his 
application. DOHA set forth the basis for its action in a Statement of Reasons (SOR), 
citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006.  
 
2 
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 8, 2012; answered it on May 25, 2012; and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on 
June 1, 2012. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 18, 2012, and the 
case was assigned to an administrative judge on July 20, 2012. DOHA issued a notice 
of hearing on July 30, 2012, scheduling it for August 15, 2012. Applicant’s attorney 
entered her appearance on July 31, 2012, and requested that the hearing be 
postponed. Her request was granted. 
 
On August 2, 2012, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing, rescheduling 
the hearing for September 11, 2012. The case was reassigned to another administrative 
judge on August 28, 2012, and the hearing was cancelled on August 31, 2012, in order 
to consolidate it with other hearings in the same area at a later date.  
 
The case was reassigned to me on September 6, 2012. After coordinating with 
Applicant’s attorney, DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 2, 2012, scheduling it 
for October 26, 2012. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 
1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without objection. 
I kept the record open until November 13, 2012, to enable Applicant to submit additional 
documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX D through G, which were admitted 
without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 7, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i.  His 
admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 58-year-old supervisory electrician employed by a defense 
contractor since March 1999. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 
September 1976 to December 1997, when he retired. The record does not reflect his 
rate and rating at the time of his retirement.  
 
Applicant worked as a master electrician for a private company from March 1998 
until he began his current job. He attended college courses from January 2000 to July 
2002 but did not receive a degree.  His security clearance application reflects that he 
has held a security clearance since at least March 1996.  
 
 Applicant married in December 1977. He and his wife have four children, ranging 
in age from 20 to 35. One adult child lives with them and occasionally contributes to 
household expenses. (Tr. 32.)  
 
 Applicant and his wife used a tax preparer for their state and federal income 
taxes for tax years 2005, 2006, and 2007. They did not review their returns before filing 
them and did not notice that the tax preparer claimed several deductions and 
exemptions that were erroneous or unsupportable. When Applicant learned in 2009 that 
 
3 
 
his returns were being audited, he did not contact the tax preparer, because the auditor 
informed him that several other clients of the tax preparer also were being audited. His 
pay was garnished for state taxes in late 2009. (GX 2 at 6-7.) 
 
 Applicant had started to have financial difficulties in 2007, when he was 
transferred from the field to an office job with reduced pay and no opportunity for 
overtime. However, he was able to make the minimum payments on his credit card 
debts until his pay was garnished.  
 
In July 2012, after Applicant received the SOR, he contracted with a debt 
resolution company, which is handling the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 
1.e. (AX E at 18.) He pays the debt resolution company $618 per month. (Tr. 59; AX E 
at 1.) Three debts listed in his schedule of creditors do not correspond to any of the 
debts alleged in the SOR. (AX E at 18, items 1, 3, and 5.) Item 1 on the schedule of 
creditors is a $19,373 debt to a credit union, which was not alleged in the SOR. At the 
hearing, Applicant identified this debt as a credit card account that “piled up over time.” 
(Tr. 39.) Item 3 is a $3,491 debt to a financial institution and Item 5 is a $1,135 debt to a 
home improvement store, neither of which is alleged in the SOR. Applicant was unable 
to provide any information about Items 3 and 5. (Tr. 42-45.) 
 
 During a personal subject interview (PSI) in July 2010, Applicant told an 
investigator that his wife paid all the family bills. He did not know what she had paid, the 
status of their debts, or the balances due on any of their debts. (GX 2 at 7.) 
 
Applicant gave his credit report to the debt resolution company and trusts it to 
resolve the delinquent debts. At the hearing, he was unsure if all the debts alleged in 
the SOR were included in his debt resolution plan. However, his agreement with the 
debt resolution company allows him to add additional delinquent debts that he may 
discover. He was not sure if there were any delinquent debts that he had not yet 
submitted to the debt resolution company. (Tr. 39-46, 59-61.) The evidence concerning 
the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: Credit card (past due in amount of $345). This debt is included in 
Applicant’s debt resolution plan. (AX E at 18.) In July 2011, Applicant submitted a 
personal financial statement (PFS) reflecting that he was making monthly $100 
payments on this debt before he included it in his debt resolution plan. (GX 2 at 17.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: Credit card (past due in amount of $307). This debt is reflected as 
charged off in Applicant’s credit bureau report (CBR) dated July 5, 2012. Applicant sent 
a letter sent to the creditor in July 2011, asking for a settlement offer, but he has not 
received a response. This debt is not included in Applicant’s debt resolution plan. It is 
unresolved. (GX 2 at 13; GX 4 at 2; GX 5 at 2.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: Credit card (in collection for $5,708). This debt was charged off in 
March 2009 (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that he was 
making monthly $300 payments on this debt by automatic withdrawal from his checking 
 
4 
 
account. He stopped making payments when the debt was included in his debt 
resolution plan in July 2012. At some time not reflected in the record, the creditor 
obtained a judgment and garnished Applicant’s pay. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant’s pay 
voucher for the pay period ending on September 9, 2012, reflects a garnishment for 
$414.71. (AX B.) On October 3, 2012, the creditor agreed to release the garnishment in 
return for Applicant’s agreement to resume making monthly $300 payments beginning 
on October 30, 2012. (AX G.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: Credit Card (in collection for $6,368). This debt was Included in 
Applicant’s debt resolution plan, and it was settled for $2,547. (AX C; AX E at 18; AX F.) 
Applicant does not know whether the debt resolution company will pay the agreed 
amount in installments or will wait until the entire amount is accumulated from his 
monthly $618 payments. (Tr. 59-60.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: Credit Card (past due in amount of $481). This debt appears to be 
a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.a, which is included in Applicant’s debt resolution plan (AX E at 
18.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: Credit Card (past due in amount of $410). Applicant denied this 
debt. In his answer to the SOR, he stated, “According to my wife, she continues to pay 
about $50.00/month.” He submitted no documentation of payments. In July 2011, he 
sent a letter to the creditor asking for a settlement proposal. (GX 2 at 14.) The debt is 
not included in Applicant’s debt resolution plan and not reflected in the two credit reports 
(GX 4 and GX 5) submitted by Department Counsel. (AX E at 18.) I conclude that this 
debt is not established by substantial evidence.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: Credit card (in collection for $1,232). Applicant admitted this debt, 
which is reflected in his CBR dated September 26, 2011. (GX 5 at 3.) It is not included 
in the debt resolution plan. It is unresolved.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: Federal Income Tax ($22,882). Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
records reflect that Applicant and his wife owed this amount for tax years 2006, 2007, 
2008, and 2009. They executed a payment agreement in April 2011, providing for 
monthly $200 payments. (GX 2 at 21; GX 3 at 2-8.) In October 2012, Applicant 
increased his monthly payments to $300, and they are automatically deducted from his 
bank account. (Tr. 36-37.) The balance has been reduced to about $17,000 (Tr. 29.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: State Income Tax ($1,436). State tax records reflect that Applicant 
and his wife owed this amount for tax years 2006 and 2007. (GX 3 at 10.) The state 
collected about $300 per month by garnishing Applicant’s pay. The debt was paid in full 
as of October 31, 2012. (AX A; AX B; AX D.)  
 
 Applicant was promoted to a supervisory electrician position in December 2009, 
with an increase in pay of about $1,400 per month. (GX 2 at 7-8; Tr. 31.) In his July 
2010 PSI, he told an investigator that his net family income was $4,585, monthly 
expenses were $1,787, and debt payments were about $2,500. He estimated that his 
 
5 
 
net monthly remainder was $298. He stated that he had savings of about $12,000. (GX 
2 at 8.) 
 
In Applicant’s July 2011 PFS, he reported his net salary of $2,800, his spouse’s 
net salary of $1,500, his military retirement income of $1,100, monthly expenses of 
$1,840, monthly debt payments of $4,798, and a net remainder of $602. He reported 
savings of about $500 and investments of about $3,000. (GX 1 at 17.) 
 
 Applicant’s PFS reflected the $300 per month being deducted from his pay for 
past-due state taxes. It did not reflect that the state tax debt has been satisfied, and it 
did not reflect the $618 he pays monthly to his debt resolution company or the $300 per 
month he is paying on his federal tax debt. It reflected monthly $100 payments on the 
debt alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.e, which is now included in the debt resolution plan. 
Finally, it did not reflect that the $19,000 credit union debt, on which he was paying 
$383 per month, is now included in his debt resolution plan. (GX 2 at 17.)  
 
Applicant has not updated the information in his PFS to reflect the changes in his 
financial status. Consequently the record does not accurately reflect his current net 
monthly remainder, although it probably is less than the $602 he reported in July 2011. 
At the hearing, he testified that he is “in kind of a bind right now,” and “still struggling.” 
(Tr. 32, 39.).  
 
Applicant owns his home, worth about $410,000, and his mortgage loan 
payments are current. His payments on his first and second mortgages were listed on 
his PFS. He no longer uses his credit cards. He owns three cars worth a total of about 
$22,000. His car loans, which were included among the debt payments in his PFS, are 
paid off. (GX 2 at 8, 17; Tr. 30-32.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
6 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, including a federal income tax debt of 
about $22,882 for tax years 2006 through 2009 and a state income tax debt of about 
$1,436 for tax years 2006 and 2007. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 
18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
7 
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an applicant’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and his CBRs establish the following disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 AG ¶ 19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same”) is not established. Applicant filed his 
returns as required and, although it appears that the returns were fraudulent, Applicant 
was unaware of the fraud until he was notified that his returns were being audited.   
 
 Security concerns based on financial considerations may be mitigated by any of 
the following conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
 
8 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
 
AG ¶ 20(f): the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established, because Applicant’s delinquent debts are ongoing, 
numerous, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. To the 
contrary, Applicant’s continued inattention to his financial situation makes recurrence 
likely.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. Applicant’s reduction in income in 2007 was a 
circumstance beyond his control, but the delinquent federal and state tax debts were 
due to his negligence, not circumstances beyond his control. Furthermore, he has not 
acted responsibly. His July 2010 PSI reflected that he was totally unaware of his 
financial situation. He now relies on a debt resolution company to manage his credit 
card debts, but he is unaware of the status of his delinquent debts and exercises 
virtually no oversight. At the hearing, he was able to link the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a, 1.c, and 1.e to two debts in his debt resolution plan, but he did not know if all the 
debts in the SOR were included in the plan.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has obtained legal advice and debt 
management advice. He was making payments in July 2011 on the credit card debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and duplicated in SOR ¶ 1.e, and the debt is now included in his 
debt resolution plan. The credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has been settled, the 
federal tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is under control, and the state tax debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.i has been resolved. However, there is no indication that the credit card debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g, which are not included in the debt resolution plan, are 
being resolved. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(c) is established for the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i, but not for the debts alleged in the SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially established. The key element of this mitigating condition is 
a “good-faith effort.” Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not 
mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  
Applicant’s enrollment in the debt resolution plan after he received the SOR does not 
show good faith, because it appears to have been motivated by his desire to protect his 
security clearance rather than a sense of obligation to his creditors.  
 
 The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and duplicated in SOR ¶ 1.e is included in 
Applicant’s debt resolution plan, and his PFS indicates that he was making payments on 
 
9 
 
this debt before it was included in his plan. There is no evidence of any payments on 
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g, which are not included in the debt resolution 
plan. The credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d has been settled, although it is not clear 
when or how the agreed amount will be paid. The state tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i 
was collected by involuntary garnishment, which does not constitute “good faith” within 
the meaning of AG ¶ 20(d). However, the record reflects that Applicant has made a 
“good-faith effort” to resolve his federal tax debt through a monthly payment plan. I 
conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 
and 1.h, but not for the debts alleged in SOR¶¶ 1.b, 1.g, and 1.i. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable because Applicant has not presented documentary 
evidence that he has disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG ¶ 20(f) is not 
relevant because there is no evidence of unexplained affluence. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment.  
 
 A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to 
establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish 
a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. 
There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts 
simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid 
first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). On the other hand, 
evidence that debts alleged in the SOR have been paid or otherwise resolved does not 
 
10 
 
necessarily resolve the question whether an applicant has demonstrated the judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness required of persons holding a security clearance.  
 
 Applicant’s debt resolution program encompasses some of the debts alleged in 
the SOR, and he has taken significant steps to carry out his plan. However, his financial 
plan does not encompass all the debts alleged in the SOR, and it includes three debts 
totaling almost $24,000 that were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant is living on a tight 
budget, and he will not maintain financial stability without more attention devoted to his 
financial situation than he has demonstrated in the past. He knew virtually nothing about 
the status of his delinquent debts when he was interviewed by an investigator in July 
2010. At the hearing, he was generally familiar with the status of the two tax debts, but 
his testimony demonstrated that he still does not have a good grasp of his overall 
financial situation. He does not appear to have learned from his disastrous experience 
with his federal and state tax returns, because he continues to rely on others to resolve 
his financial problems, with minimal oversight on his part. I am not convinced that 
recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy for more than 20 years, and he has 
worked for a defense contractor and held a security clearance for more than 13 years. 
However, he did not provide any evidence of the quality of his duty performance or his 
reputation for honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.f:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.h-1.i:    For Applicant 
 
11 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
