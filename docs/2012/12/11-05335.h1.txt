DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 27, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. 
This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on July 31, 2012, and requested a hearing on 
August 17, 2012. The case was assigned to me on October 12, 2012. DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing on November 7, 2012, and the hearing was convened as scheduled 
on November 16, 2012. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s 
 
2 
 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 that were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified and offered documents marked as Appellant’s Exhibits (AE) A and B that were 
admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
November 29, 2012.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
At the hearing, Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement in 
Paragraph E3.1.8 of the Directive.1  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
working for her current employer for about 28 years. She graduated from high school in 
1973 and attended college for about a year. She has been married twice. Her first 
marriage began in January 1975 and ended by divorce in September 1983. She married 
her current husband in October 1995. She has a daughter who is 39 years old and a 
stepson who is 35 years old. This is the first time she has sought to obtain a security 
clearance.2  
 
 The SOR alleged that Applicant had ten delinquent debts totaling about $29,833. 
Those debts were listed on credit reports obtained on February 16, 2011, March 16, 
2012, and April 15, 2012. In her Answer, Applicant admitted each of the delinquent debt 
allegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.3 
 
 Applicant attributed her financial problems to a period of unemployment from July 
2009 to March 2010 and to having to provide support to her parents. In July 2009, she 
was laid off her job due to an economic downturn. While unemployed, she did not 
collect unemployment compensation. From March 2010 to October 2010, she worked 
for another employer. She was rehired by her current employer in October 2010. Her 
parents had chronic illnesses, and she helped them pay for their medications and 
household bills. Since she began providing them support, her father has passed away, 
but she continues to provide about $500 per month in support to her mother. She also 
periodically provides support to her daughter.4 
 
 In December 2006, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She was informed that 
she earned too much for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and converted that proceeding to a 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. At that time, her assets totaled about $5,000 and her liabilities 
totaled about $20,000. She testified that she could not keep up with the monthly

payments of $1,300 to the bankruptcy trustee. The bankruptcy was dismissed in 
January 2008.5 
 
 In April 2012, Applicant entered into a debt consolidation program. This program 
will only address debts that are over $100. Seven of her debts totaling $20,290 are 
listed in that program. Under this program, she will pay $354 per month for 45 months 
towards those debts. As discussed below, some of the debts alleged in the SOR are 
listed in the program. Since April 2012, she has made her monthly payments to that 
program. She has authorized the debt consolidation company to automatically debit her 
bank account for the monthly payments.6 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a – judgment for $11,798. This debt was for a vehicle loan. The 
judgment was filed in September 2008. In March 2012, Applicant entered into a 
repayment agreement with the creditor. This repayment agreement is not part of her 
debt consolidation program. Under the agreement, she will pay $75 per month until the 
debt is fully paid. She provided documents showing that she has made the $75 payment 
since April 2012.7 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b – judgment for $1,559. This debt was for a personal loan used to pay 
medical bills. The judgment was filed in November 2006. During her Office of Personnel 
Management interview in February 2011, Applicant stated that she began making 
monthly payment of $40 towards this debt and had made six of those payments. She 
did not provide proof of those payments. She did provide a money order that indicated 
that she made a $20 payment to the creditor in February 2012.  She also sent the 
creditor a $15 money order in October 2012.8 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.c – charged-off account for $6,784. This debt was a line of credit 
account. The date of last activity on this account was June 2006. This debt is listed in 
Applicant’s debt consolidation program.9 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.d – charged-off account for $7,464. This debt was an unsecured loan. 
The date of last activity on this account was October 2004. This debt is listed in 
Applicant’s debt consolidation program.10

listed in the program is identical to the amount listed in SOR ¶ 1.d.

 SOR ¶ 1.e – collection account for $1,329. This debt was a telephone service 
account that was placed for collection in December 2011. This debt is listed in 
Applicant’s debt consolidation program.11 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $408. This debt was a credit card account. The 
date of last activity on this account was September 2006. In her Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant indicated that she is making monthly payments to satisfy this debt and 
provided a copy of a $10 money order sent to the creditor in July 2012. She also sent 
the creditor a $15 money order in October 2012.12 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g – collection account for $128. This debt was a credit card account. 
The date of last activity on this account was April 2010. In her Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant indicated that she is making monthly payments to satisfy this debt and 
provided a copy of a $10 money order sent to the creditor in July 2012. She also sent 
the creditor a $10 money order payment in October 2012.13 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h – collection account for $62. This debt was a medical account. In her 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that she is making monthly payments to satisfy 
this debt and provided a copy of a $10 money order sent to the creditor in July 2012.14 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i – collection account for $79. This is a collection agency account. The 
original creditor is unknown. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that she is 
making monthly payments to satisfy this debt and provided a copy of a $10 money order 
sent to the creditor in July 2012.15 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j – collection account for $1,020. This debt was a telephone service 
account. The date of last activity on this account was January 2011. This debt is listed 
in Applicant’s debt consolidation program.16 
   
 Applicant’s annual income with overtime is about $60,000. In March 2012, she 
submitted a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) that reflected her net monthly 
remainder was $2,035. Based on the information provided, however, her calculations on 
the PFS do not add up and could not be verified.17

 Policies  
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 In 2006, Applicant filed bankruptcy that was dismissed in 2008. She has 
accumulated ten delinquent debts totaling over $29,000 that she was unable or 
unwilling to satisfy for an extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Several Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 
7 
 
A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a 
procedure designed to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.18 
An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he or she has resolved 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the 
financial problems and take sufficient action to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor 
is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first.19 
 
In this case, Applicant was unemployed from July 2009 to March 2010. She also 
provided support to her elderly parents who were chronically ill. Her unemployment and 
her parents’ illnesses were conditions beyond her control that contributed to her 
financial problems. For AG ¶ 20(b) to apply fully, an individual must not only experience 
one or more conditions beyond his or her control, but also must have acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. Here, some of the delinquent debt predated her period of 
unemployment and she presented no evidence that she took action to resolve the debts 
before her OPM interview other than her Chapter 13 bankruptcy attempt. In April 2012, 
she entered into a repayment arrangement for one debt totaling $11,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a) 
and established a debt consolidation program for four other debts totaling $16,597 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.j). During the past seven months, she has been making the 
monthly payments on the repayment arrangement and debt consolidation program. For 
the remaining five debts totaling $2,108 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i), she has 
made some small, sporadic payments. From the evidence presented, it appears that 
she is focusing on first resolving the larger debts. On the whole, she has taken 
significant steps to show that she is committed to resolving her debts. She is living 
within her means and her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 
20(d) fully apply, while AG ¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
                                                          
18 See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 
19 See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has worked for her current employer for about 28 years. She has taken 
meaningful steps to resolve her delinquent debts. She is on the right track. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated 
the security concerns arising under Guideline F.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
   
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.j:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
