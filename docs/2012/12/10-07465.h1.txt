GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 16, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a Security 
Clearance Application (e-QIP).1 On August 20, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on November 4, 2011.2 DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
him on April 25, 2012, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December

29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (financial considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 20, 2012. In an unsworn statement, dated 
June 21, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. On September 21, 2012, Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was initially assigned to another 
administrative judge on October 11, 2012, but was reassigned to me on November 1, 
2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 30, 2012, and I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on December 11, 2012.3 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and four 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE D) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and one other witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
December 20, 2012. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. 
Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, and he submitted three additional exhibits 
(AE E through AE G) that were admitted into evidence without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of the three factual allegations 
(¶ 1.a. of the SOR). That admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. He 
denied the remaining allegations (¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.).4 After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since February 
2010, has served as an associate. He previously held a variety of positions with other 
employers, where he was a consultant, real estate developer, real estate broker, 
director or Oracle technology, consultant, and programmer/analyst.5 After being laid off 
in August 2009 due to economic conditions, he was unemployed from September 2009 
until January 2010.6 Applicant’s current employment is located approximately 280 miles 
from his residence requiring that he commute every weekend between home and office.

 While the Notice of Hearing was issued within 15 days of the scheduled hearing date, Department Counsel 
and Applicant were, over an extensive period before the notice was issued, in discussions regarding the date and 
location of the hearing. See, the Directive, Encl. 3, ' E3.1.8. Nevertheless, in an abundance of caution, I asked 
Applicant if he had any objections to proceeding. He did not object, and waived the 15 day notice. See, Tr. at 12.

 At the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by correcting a 
typographical error in SOR & 1.c., as follows: delete the figure $5,9242.00 and substitute the figure $59,242.00. 
There being no objection, the motion was granted and the error was corrected. See, Tr. at 11-12.

Applicant attended a U.S. military academy from July 1977 until he was 
graduated with a B.A. degree and commissioned in May 1981. He subsequently 
attended another university from January 1988 until May 1991 when he earned an M.S. 
degree.7 He served on active duty as an infantry officer of the U.S. Army from May 1981 
until March 1988, when he was discharged and issued an honorable discharge 
certificate.8 In April 1988, he joined the U.S. Army National Guard (ARNG) and 
remained an active member until he resigned in October 1997 and again was issued an 
honorable discharge certificate.9 His highest grade was major. During his combined 
military service, he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Service 
Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Army Commendation Medal with four 
insignia, the Army Achievement Medal with one insignia, the ARNG Long Service 
Medal, the ARNG Mobilization Support Ribbon, and the ARNG Foreign Deployment 
Service Ribbon.10 He initially received a secret security clearance in 1977,11 and was 
granted a top secret security clearance in 2005.  
 
Applicant was married in 1982. He and his wife have two daughters (born in 1984 
and 1987) and three grandchildren.12  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until the latter 
part of 2006. In 2005, his adjusted gross income was $879,916 and he should have 
made quarterly income tax payments totaling $264,212.13 He failed to do so. That same 
year, because he had been traveling extensively for his job and he was missing a 
desired level of involvement in his family life, he executed a change of pace. With a 
soaring real estate market, he joined two other individuals in a land development 
project. He also became a real estate broker. The project involved the purchase and 
development of a 700 acre tract of land. Applicant initially invested $230,000 of his own 
capital into the project in February 2005.14 In May 2005, he borrowed $860,000 to 
purchase 23 acres of the original 46 acre project.15 The land project was sold in 2007

for approximately $10,000,000, but Applicant only received his initial $230,000 
investment plus about $25,000 to $30,000 back.16  His share, based on the agreement 
he had with his partners, should have been over $1,000,000. Applicant sued his partner, 
but the matter is still in litigation, and Applicant has been ordered by the court not to 
reveal information regarding the litigation.17 
 
Although Applicant is unable to specify all of his 2005 expenditures, he also 
invested $100,000 in a natural gas project, an unspecified sum in some stocks, and 
funded a daughter’s college tuition. He denied making any “crazy” spending.18 In 2006, 
his adjusted gross income had decreased to $100,000. In 2007, it was $20,122, and in 
2008, it was $25,578.19 
 
Several conditions contributed to Applicant’s financial bind: the collapse of the 
real estate market in 2006 and 2007; his partner’s failure to pay Applicant his share of 
the proceeds from the land development project; and the cancellation of a large 
contract.20 In 2006, the IRS penalized Applicant substantial sums for failing to pay his 
2005 income taxes.21 In June 2007, the IRS placed a lien on Applicant’s assets due to 
the $270,853 balance owed. He was credited with payments taken from his subsequent 
income tax refunds.22 In May 2007, the state department of revenue also filed a lien on 
his assets in the amount of $59,242.23 
 
In 2008, in an effort to generate additional funds, Applicant started “flipping” 
houses.24 He purchased several distressed homes and rehabilitated them to sell at 
increased prices. He and his sister jointly purchased a fourplex with his sister paying 
$15,000, acquiring a $37,000 mortgage loan, and Applicant contributing “sweat-equity.” 
He purchased a condominium for $5,000 and rehabilitated it, and in 2012, he purchased 
a single family house for $1,000 and rehabilitated it. The house and the condominium 
are owned free and clear of mortgages.25 
 
As noted above, Applicant was laid off due to economic reasons and was 
unemployed from September 2009 until January 2010. That period of unemployment,

along with his other financial issues, caused him to have insufficient funds to make all of 
his monthly payments. As a result, accounts, including his home mortgage, became 
delinquent. He was essentially living on his credit cards, and by 2010, he had about 
$70,000 in credit card debt, with a number of accounts in collection, and one in 
judgment.26 Applicant filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code in March 2010. He listed $160,147.92 in claims with creditors 
holding unsecured nonpriority claims and $563,514.60 with creditors holding secured 
claims.27 All of Applicant’s delinquent accounts, including his two income tax accounts, 
were discharged in July 2010.28  
 
Although Applicant’s state recognized the bankruptcy discharge of his 2005 tax 
liability, a certificate of tax liability was filed and it will remain in place until the debt has 
been paid.29 Nevertheless, the IRS tax lien was released in February 2012, and the 
state tax lien was released in November 2012.30 Despite the liens having been 
released, the case “remains open because of an unresolved dispute related to the 
Trustee’s attempts to sell [Applicant’s] residence.”31 Although Applicant no longer has 
any personal liability for the tax debt, it remains a possibility, challenged by Applicant in 
court, that the IRS could levy on the property and attempt to sell the residence in a tax 
foreclosure sale.32 Applicant’s mortgage on the residence is $183,000 and that 
residence is worth about $280,000.33 Although he is no longer obligated to make 
payments on the mortgage because of his bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has 
continued making his monthly mortgage payments.34 In the event he loses his court

challenge, he is prepared to vacate the residence.35 Applicant has no delinquent 
accounts remaining.36 
 
In November 2011, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement that 
reflected the monthly combined net income for himself and his wife as $8,000.37 He 
claimed $2,950 in monthly expenses and $1,938 in student loan payments, leaving a 
monthly net remainder of $3,112 available for discretionary spending or saving.38 
Applicant’s wife now has a better job which added $2,000 per month to their combined 
income and the same increase to their monthly net remainder.39 
 
In addition to the mandatory financial counseling for the bankruptcy, Applicant 
obtained 13 weeks of financial counseling from the Dave Ramsey Financial Peace 
University for financial responsibility in spending reduction, budgeting, debt payments, 
and investments.40 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”41 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”42   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.44  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”45 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”46 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
                                                          
43
 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Although Applicant’s 2005 adjusted gross income was $879,916 and 
he should have made quarterly income tax payments, he failed to do so. That same 
year he made substantial investments in a land development project, a natural gas 
project, and some stocks, and funded a daughter’s college tuition. The next three years 
saw his adjusted gross income substantially diminished. Tax liens were filed on 
Applicant’s assets by the IRS and the state. Because he had insufficient funds to make 
all of his monthly payments, accounts became delinquent, and by 2010, he had about 
$70,000 in credit card debt, with a number of accounts in collection, and one in 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where 
 
the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and 
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
When the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, AG ¶ 
20(c) may apply. Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual 
 
9 
                                      
 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.47 Also, 
when the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due 
debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate 
the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue, AG ¶ 20(e) 
may apply. 
AG ¶ 20(a) applies and ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Although he was not aware of 
any financial difficulties until 2006, Applicant’s actual financial problems commenced in 
2005. Although he had a good income, he failed to make his quarterly income tax 
payments, and, instead, made substantial investments in land development, natural 
gas, and stocks. As Applicant acknowledged, his failure to make those quarterly tax 
payments was his own fault, and could not be attributed to anyone else. However, 
several conditions contributed to Applicant’s financial bind, and they were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control: the collapse of the real estate market in 2006 and 2007; his 
partner’s failure to pay Applicant over $1,000,000, his share of the proceeds from the 
land development project; the cancellation of a large contract; and his layoff and period 
of unemployment. While those financial issues caused him to have insufficient funds to 
make all of his monthly payments, he attempted to generate additional funds through 
investing in distressed properties and rehabilitating them. Applicant filed a voluntary 
petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in March 2010. In 
July 2010, his delinquent accounts were discharged. Free from the pressures of 
delinquent debts, Applicant was able to restore his financial house. Applicant now 
possesses a new awareness of his financial responsibilities and the pitfalls of dealing 
with questionable investor-associates. Applicant’s financial problems occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Furthermore, he finally acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.48  
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. As noted above, in addition to the mandatory 
financial counseling for the bankruptcy, Applicant obtained 13 weeks of financial 
counseling from the Dave Ramsey Financial Peace University for financial responsibility 
                                                          
47
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

in spending reduction, budgeting, debt payments, and investments. Furthermore, there 
are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. 
All of Applicant’s former delinquent accounts were discharged in his 2010 bankruptcy. 
He was credited with payments for his 2005 income taxes taken from his subsequent 
income tax refunds. He has also continued to make his monthly mortgage payments 
following the bankruptcy discharge although he is no longer obligated to do so. In 
November 2011, Applicant’s combined family monthly net income was $8,000. It is now 
up to $10,000, and he has a monthly net remainder of about $5,000 available for 
discretionary spending or saving. He jointly owns a fourplex with his sister for which he 
contributed “sweat-equity.” He also owns a condominium and a single family house, free 
and clear of mortgages. His federal and state income liens have been released.49 
Although Applicant no longer has any personal liability for the tax debt, it remains a 
possibility that the IRS could levy on the property and attempt to sell the residence in a 
tax foreclosure sale. In the event he loses his court challenge, he is prepared to vacate 
the residence. It is significant that since his bankruptcy discharge in 2010, now nearly 
three years later, Applicant no longer has any delinquent accounts remaining. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies. Although Applicant’s credit reports reflect that there are still 
income tax liens, those reports are incorrect. The liens were released by both the IRS 
and the state, and Applicant denied the SOR allegations. According to his bankruptcy 
attorney, and the law, Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the alleged status of 
those liens. Applicant has provided documented proof to substantiate the basis of his 
disputes. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.50 
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His investment 
activities and mishandling of the family finances pertaining, in part, to his failure to make 
quarterly income tax payments in 2005, eventually permitted a number of accounts to 
become delinquent. As a result, accounts became past-due, placed for collection, 
became income tax liens, or went to judgment.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Flying high as an investor with a substantial income in 2005, circumstances changed 
and financial problems ensued. While he alone is responsible for his failure to make the 
required quarterly income tax payments, several conditions contributed to Applicant’s 
financial bind that were largely beyond Applicant’s control: the collapse of the real 
estate market; his partner’s failure to pay Applicant his share of the proceeds from the 
land development project; the cancellation of a large contract; and his layoff and period 
of unemployment. In those instances where he could not contribute monetarily, 
Applicant contributed his “sweat equity.” Applicant now owns a condominium and a 
single family house, free and clear of mortgages. His income liens have been released. 
Applicant no longer has any personal liability for the tax debt, but it remains a possibility 
that the IRS could levy on the property and attempt to sell it in a tax foreclosure sale. 
Applicant is prepared to vacate the residence. Also, since his bankruptcy discharge of

nearly three years ago, Applicant no longer has any delinquent accounts remaining. 
Applicant is a decorated military veteran, the former holder of a security clearance, and 
a good husband, father, and grandfather. 
 
 I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.51 Applicant has 
demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt reduction and elimination. He has 
resolved all of his debts. Delinquent accounts were discharged and income tax liens 
were released. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
