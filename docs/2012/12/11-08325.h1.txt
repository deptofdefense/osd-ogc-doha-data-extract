Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts or accounts, totaling $30,406. She 
has a history of delinquent debt and did not make sufficient progress resolving her 
delinquent SOR debts. On December 3, 2010, she completed her Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 85P) (GE 1), and she falsely 
denied that she had any reportable delinquent debts. However, she subsequently 
volunteered information about delinquent debts to an investigator from the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM). Personal conduct concerns are mitigated; however, 
financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Her eligibility to occupy a public 
trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 27, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant (hearing exhibit (HE) 2), pursuant to 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified 
and revised; Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security 
Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F (financial 
considerations) and E (personal conduct). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Regulation that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to occupy 
a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. (HE 2) DOHA 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such access to 
sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On August 29, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) On 
October 19, 2012, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On 
October 25, 2012, the case was assigned to me. On November 14, 2012, DOHA issued 
a hearing notice setting the hearing for December 6, 2012. (HE 1) The hearing was held 
as scheduled using video teleconference. (HE 1) Department Counsel offered six 
exhibits (GE 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 17), and Applicant offered six exhibits. (Tr. 19-21; AE 
A-F) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A-F. (Tr. 18, 21-22) 
Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR, and hearing notice. (HE 1-3) On 
December 14, 2012, I received the transcript.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted responsibility for all of the SOR debts except 
for the debts described in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.t, and 1.v. She denied the allegations 
of intentional falsification made in SOR ¶ 2.a. She was unsure or disputed some of the 
amounts of the other SOR debts. She also provided extenuating and mitigating 
information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who has worked 
quoting benefits and providers for a medical care provider since July 2010. (Tr. 6, 24; 
GE 1) In 2007, she earned a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). (Tr. 6-7) In the last 
several years, she received about 25 college credits. (Tr. 6-7) She was unemployed 
from January 2002 to October 2004, from June 2006 to October 2006, from April 2007 
to October 2007, from August 2008 to October 2008, and from May to July 2010. (April 
29, 2011 OPM personal subject interview (PSI)) She worked for a commercial firm from 
November 2008 to April 2010. (Tr. 31-34) She has never served in the military. (Tr. 6) 
She is not married. (Tr. 7-8)  
 
Applicant has two children, who are ages four years and four months. (Tr. 7-8) 
She has not received any financial support from the father of her four-year-old child for 
six or seven months, and she has not received any financial support from the father of 
her youngest child. (Tr. 36, 76, 91-93) She is the head of her household. (Tr. 8)

Financial considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR and credit reports list 22 delinquent debts or accounts, totaling 
$30,406. The amount of the debts ranged from a repossessed vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.r for 
$8,548) and a delinquent student loan (SOR ¶ 1.p for $6,719) to four debts less than 
$80 each (SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.s, 1.t, and 1.v).  Starting in July 2010, she received a part-time 
salary of about $12 per hour from her current employer. (Tr. 25) In December 2010, she 
became a full-time employee, and she received $14.50 per hour. (Tr. 24-25) In 
December 2011, she received a raise to $14.71 per hour, and in November 2012, her 
pay was increased to $15.30 per hour. (Tr. 26; AE B) Her annual salary is now $31,824. 
(Tr. 25-26; AE B) She received good performance reviews at her employment. (Tr. 26) 
Recently, she missed about three weeks of work because her newborn has been ill with 
a respiratory virus. (Tr. 27-29) 
 
In Applicant’s April 29, 2011 OPM PSI, she discussed the delinquent debts on 
her credit report and indicated she would contact all of her creditors and arrange 
payment plans. (April 29, 2011 OPM PSI at 13) She said she did not receive financial 
counseling. (April 29, 2011 OPM PSI at 13) 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists three delinquent student loans. The student loans in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a ($2,552), 1.p ($6,719), and 1.q ($1,630) are probably included in her loan 
rehabilitation program. (Tr. 46-47, 55-56) Applicant initially learned that she had six 
student loans, which totaled about $15,000. (Tr. 42) She paid a student loan for $783 on 
March 22, 2012, and for $26 on August 6, 2010, according to a June 4, 2012 letter from 
a creditor. (GE 2 at 4) A collection company sought $18,996 from Applicant. (Tr. 43; AE 
C) One student loan collection company started garnishing $900 monthly from her pay 
until one of her student loans was paid off in March 2012. (Tr. 70) A collection company 
notified Applicant that they intended to intercept her tax refund. (Tr. 44) On November 
28, 2012, she made her first payment of $20 to the creditor seeking $18,996 under a 
rehabilitation agreement Applicant signed on December 5, 2012. (Tr. 44-46; AE A, C) If 
she makes nine $20 payments, her student loan will be rehabilitated to current status. 
(Tr. 45; AE C) After the rehabilitation period, her payments may increase. (AE C) (Tr. 
55-56) Applicant was unsure about the amount owed on her student loans, and she 
conceded she may owe as much as $36,660 in student loan debt. (Tr. 97; GE 6) 
However, the listing of student loans totaling $36,660 in Applicant’s credit report 
probably has duplications. (Tr. 97; GE 6)   
 
Applicant has been evicted twice, and those two evictions resulted in substantial 
unpaid debts. (Tr. 72) In September 2008, Applicant was late with her rent on her 
apartment, and she was evicted. (Tr. 51) The breach of her lease and some damage to 
the apartment resulted in the $2,400 debt in SOR ¶ 1.l. (Tr. 51, 55) She asked the 
collection company seeking collection of the apartment debt to suggest a payment plan; 
however, she could not afford the proposed payments. (Tr. 52) After her first eviction, 
she lived with her mother. Then she moved into another apartment. (Tr. 51-55, 71) Her 
next apartment landlord was seeking $1,481 from Applicant for one month’s rent of 
$650 and some charges, which she disputed. (SOR ¶ 1.f) (Tr. 53-54) She did not make 
any payments to resolve either debt. (Tr. 51-55)

Four of Applicant’s medical debts were listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($533), 1.c ($650), 
1.d ($666), and 1.k ($365). (Tr. 56, 61-62) Some of the debts predate 2010. For 
example the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k went to collection in November 2008. (Tr. 62; GE 6) She 
was unsure about her responsibility for these debts because she was on Medicaid. (Tr. 
56) She did not make any payments to these creditors. (Tr. 57) She did not provide 
documentation showing she disputed her responsibility for these four medical debts. 
 
Applicant agreed she owed one debt for her cable service. Her SOR listed two 
debts for cable service in SOR ¶ 1.e for $349 and in SOR ¶ 1.g for $390. (Tr. 57-58; GE 
6) She asked the creditor about a settlement; however, she did not make any payments. 
(Tr. 57) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g for $390 is mitigated as a duplication of the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.e. (Tr. 58-59)  
 
Applicant paid the utilities debt in SOR ¶ 1.h for $114. (Tr. 59; GE 2 at 15-16) Her 
insurance company paid the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.j for $1,026. (Tr. 61-62; GE 2 at 
12)  
 
Applicant ordered contact lenses on the internet when she was 18 and generated 
the $75 debt in SOR ¶ 1.i. (Tr. 59-60) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.v ($75) is mitigated as a 
duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1i. (Tr. 59-60) She had a settlement offer from the 
creditor for $18; however, by the time she was ready to make the payment, she was 
unable to locate the creditor. (Tr. 61) 
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.m for $1,150 resulted from a cell phone account. (Tr. 63) 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n for $919 and 1.o for $258 were for overdraft fees from her 
bank. (Tr. 64-65) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.r for $8,548 resulted from a repossessed vehicle. 
(Tr. 66) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.s for $78 resulted from a bounced check presented at a 
grocery store. (Tr. 67-68) She was unsure of the origin of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.t for $71. 
(Tr. 72) She did not make any payments or take other action to resolve these debts 
because she was unable to reach an appropriate or reasonable settlement with the 
creditor, or she has not contacted the creditor. (Tr. 64-67)    
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.u for $357 resulted from a payday loan in 2008 or 2009. (Tr. 
73) She paid $30, and then she decided not to make any additional payments. (Tr. 73) 
 
Applicant completed a budget or personal financial statement (PFS). (Tr. 74; GE 
2 at 18) Her PFS lists nine creditors and a single payment of $93 to one creditor. (GE 2 
at 18) She said that she is current on her car payment. (Tr. 81) She has very little 
money left at the end of each month to address her SOR debts. (Tr. 81-85) She had a 
new non-SOR delinquent debt owed to a communications company for $360, and she 
has been making $150 monthly payments since July 2012 to address an Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) debt of about $2,000 for tax year 2011. (Tr. 87, 93-95) She has 
been late on most of her IRS payments. (Tr. 95-96) She is not making any payments to 
any SOR creditors, except for $20 per month paid to her student loan account as part of 
her $18,996 rehabilitation agreement. (Tr. 88)

In November 2012, she made a $160 payment and committed to paying a credit 
restoration company (CRC) $59 per month to dispute her debts and improve her credit 
report. (Tr. 88-90; AE D) On December 4, 2012, CRC agreed to assist her with 
improving her credit rating. (AE D) The CRC agreed to challenge the negative 
information on Applicant’s credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, 
Section 168; however, CRC’s assistance is limited and does not involve negotiating with 
creditors and paying bona fide debts. (AE D) 
 
Personal conduct 
 
 Applicant said she had financial problems after her first child was born in 2008 
due to intermittent periods of unemployment. (Tr. 48) She initially said she became 
aware of her financial difficulties in 2010. (Tr. 47) Later in her hearing, she conceded 
that she had delinquent debts going back to the age of 18 or for about six years. 
 
Section 22, “Your Financial Record” of Applicant’s December 3, 2010 SF 85P 
asks, “Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? 
Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.” (GE 1) 
Applicant answered, “No,” and she did not disclose any delinquent debts. (GE 1) 
Applicant explained, “I’m not sure why I answered no. I guess I didn’t understand the 
question or [I read] the question wrong. I’m not sure.” (Tr. 97) She thought that perhaps 
the financial questions were only seeking information about federal loans. (Tr. 98) She 
said that at the time she completed her SF 85P, she was not aware that her student 
loans were delinquent. (Tr. 98) She may not have received information from student 
loan creditors because they may not have had her correct address. (Tr. 99) Her 
December 31, 2010 credit report showed 20 delinquent debts. (Tr. 98; GE 4) She was 
aware that she had non-student-loan delinquent debt when she completed her SF 85P. 
(Tr. 99)  
 
Applicant’s April 29, 2011 OPM PSI indicates that she obtained her credit report 
in April 2011 and that “she volunteered information to the OPM investigator that she has 
several accounts that are either delinquent or in collections.” (GE 2 at 31) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Two of Applicant’s work-colleagues and friends described her as diligent, caring, 
responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. (AE E, F) She has received excellent ratings and 
has been awarded certificates documenting her accomplishments. (AE E) She is a 
tremendously valuable asset to her employer. (AE E, F)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal factors and conditions, the relevant trustworthiness concerns are 
under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-
12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her SOR response, and her hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges 22 
delinquent debts or accounts, totaling $30,406. Some debts have been delinquent since 
Applicant was 18 years old. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s financial conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating 
conditions to all SOR debts. I have credited Applicant with mitigating the seven SOR 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

debts in ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.v for the following reasons: (1) SOR ¶ 1.g for 
$390 is a duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $349; (2) SOR ¶ 1.h is a utilities debt 
for $114, which she said she paid; (3) SOR ¶ 1.j for $1,026 is a medical debt that she 
said her insurance company paid; (4) SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.v both for $75 are for purchase 
of contact lens and she said she was unable to locate the creditor; and (5) SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.p, and 1.q are student loans and the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q are merged into the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, as all of her student loans have been merged together into a single 
collection account in the amount of $18,996. I have credited Applicant with paying the 
IRS $150 a month, $160 to CRC, $20 to address the rehabilitation of her student loans, 
$783 to pay a student loan in March 2012, and $26 to pay a student loan in August  
2010. She also paid $30 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.u.   
 
Applicant fell behind on her debts because of changing employment, medical 
problems of her children, low-paying employment, and being a single mother, who has 
not received child support payments. She did not describe receipt of any financial 
counseling. She showed some good faith when she admitted responsibility for some of 
her SOR debts in her SOR response and at her hearing.   
 
Applicant has not taken reasonable actions to resolve most of her SOR debts. 
She has two unresolved SOR debts that are less than $100, and one debt is for a 
returned check. The circumstances beyond her control were significant; however, she 
did not adequately explain why she had not made any payments to several of her SOR 
creditors. She did not provide documentation proving that she maintained contact with 
her SOR creditors, and she did not provide any documentation showing her attempts to 
negotiate payment plans with her SOR creditors.3 There is insufficient evidence that her 
financial problem is being resolved and is under control. She did not establish her 
financial responsibility. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a trustworthiness concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the [clearance process for a public trust 
position] or any other failure to cooperate with the [clearance process for a 
public trust position]. 
 
                                            
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and 
may be disqualifying with respect to Applicant’s denial that she had debts currently 
delinquent for more than 180 days on her December 3, 2010 SF 85P. Those two 
disqualifying conditions are as follows: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative.  
 
Section 22 of Applicant’s December 3, 2010 SF 85P asks, “Are you now over 180 
days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or obligations funded 
or guaranteed by the Federal Government.” Applicant answered, “No,” and she did not 
disclose any delinquent debts. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) apply and further inquiry about 
the possible application of mitigating conditions is necessary. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the [clearance process for a public trust position]. 
Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the 
information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
AG ¶ 17(a) applies. Applicant denied that she had debts over 180 days 
delinquent. She explained, “I’m not sure why I answered no. I guess I didn’t understand 
the question or [I read] the question wrong. I’m not sure.” (Tr. 97) She said that she 
thought that perhaps the financial questions were only seeking information about federal 
loans. She said that at the time she completed her SF 85P, she was not aware that her 
student loans were delinquent. She may not have received information from student 
loan creditors that her student loans were delinquent because they may not have had 
her correct address. It is clear that at the time she completed her SF 85P she was 
confused about her financial situation, and she was not focused on the significance of 
providing accurate and complete information on this important security document. 
 
An OPM investigator interviewed Applicant 147 days later and Applicant 
“volunteered” information about her financial predicament.  She alerted the Government 
to the fact that she had a history of financial problems and that she currently had 
delinquent debt.   
 
The applicability of AG ¶ 17(a) has been limited by several Appeal Board 
decisions. An intentional omission allegation is not mitigated when an applicant admits 
the omission after an investigator tells him or her that the Government has already 
learned facts establishing the omission.4 If an Applicant provides false information in 
multiple interviews, voluntary, accurate disclosure during the third interview does not 
mitigate the falsification concern.5 In ISCR Case No. 05-10921 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 
2007) the Appeal Board considered an applicant’s claim that he promptly disclosed his 
firing from employment to an investigator after falsely denying the termination from 
employment on his security clearance application stating: 
 
. . . Applicant did not disclose his termination from the hotel until he was at 
his security clearance interview. The . . . investigating agent asked about 
the hotel in the context of previous employments and Applicant indicated 
he worked there. The investigator then asked if anyone at the hotel would 
have anything negative to say about Applicant, at which time Applicant 
supplied the investigator with a name and the hotel management.

Case No. 99-0557 at 4 (App. Bd. July 10, 2000) (reversing grant of security clearance).

Subsequently, Applicant informed the investigator that he had been fired 
from the hotel.  
 
The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 05-10921 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2007) affirmed 
the administrative judge’s decision not to credit applicant with making a “prompt, good 
faith [effort] to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.” Id. at 4-5. 
Stated differently, once it becomes apparent to an applicant that an investigator is likely 
to discover derogatory information, it is too late to receive mitigating credit under AG ¶ 
17(a).  
 
 In the instant case, Applicant disclosed the omission concerning her delinquent 
debts before being confronted with any information that made it appear likely the 
investigator would discover those debts. She fully cooperated with the investigator’s 
follow-up interrogation as indicated by her exhaustive discussion of her finances during 
the interview. Her failure to disclose financial information on her SF 85P is mitigated. 
See ISCR Case No. 09-05655, (App. Bd. Aug. 24, 2010) (mitigating Guideline E 
concern under whole-person concept); DISCR No. 93-1390 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995) 
(discussing prompt disclosure requirement); ISCR Case No. 98-0422, 1999 DOHA 
LEXIS 49, (A.J. Jan. 22, 1999) (mitigating Guideline E concern). The personal conduct 
concern pertaining to Applicant’s failure to accurately complete the financial portion of 
her SF 85P is mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
There are some facts supporting mitigation of trustworthiness concerns under the 
whole-person concept; however, they are insufficient to fully mitigate trustworthiness 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
concerns. Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who has worked 
quoting benefits and providers for a medical care provider since July 2010. She earned 
a GED and about 25 college credits. She worked for a commercial firm from November 
2008 to April 2010. She has never served in the military. She is not married, and her 
two children are ages four years and four months. I am confident that she has the ability 
and maturity to comply with requirements for a public trust position.  
 
Some circumstances beyond her control, such as insufficient income, brief 
periods of unemployment before August 2010, family medical problems, and the fathers 
of her two children’s failure to pay child support adversely affected her financial 
circumstances. She disclosed her delinquent debts during her April 29, 2011 OPM PSI. 
She knows what she must do to establish her financial responsibility. She is making 
payments to address her federal tax debt, she made a payment to begin a plan with 
CRS, she made a $20 payment to start the rehabilitation of her student loans, several 
debts were duplications, she paid $30 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.u, and two SOR debts 
were paid. In total, seven SOR debts were mitigated. Additionally, several other non-
SOR debts were paid. There is no evidence of violations of her public trust position or 
disloyalty. She has made some important progress towards mitigation of financial 
considerations concerns related to her public trust position.   
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial at 
this time. Applicant’s SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts or accounts, totaling $30,406; 
however, seven of those debts were mitigated. Some debts have been delinquent since 
she was 18, which was six years ago. She failed to prove that she could not have made 
greater progress resolving and documenting resolution of her SOR debts. Two unpaid 
SOR debts are less than $100 each, including one debt resulting from writing a check 
with insufficient funds in her account for payment. She owes more than $18,000 in 
student loans, and only recently made a $20 payment to start bringing her student loan 
account to current status. She was unsure about the total amount of her student loans, 
and she failed to contact several SOR creditors about the status of her debts.  She has 
not addressed the debt resulting from her repossessed vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.r for $8,548) or 
her two evictions (SOR ¶ 1.l for $2,400 and SOR ¶ 1.f for $1,481). Her failure to make 
greater progress paying her debts shows lack of judgment and “raise[s] questions about 
[Applicant’s] reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.” See 
AG ¶ 15.  
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 12968, the Directive, the Regulation, the AGs, and other 
cited references to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated personal conduct concerns; however, more 
documented progress addressing her debts is necessary before she will be eligible to 
occupy a public trust position.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g to 1.j:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k to 1.o:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.r to 1.u:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.v:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
