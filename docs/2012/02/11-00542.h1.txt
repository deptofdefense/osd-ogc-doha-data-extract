Decision 
______________ 
 
 
TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 15, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 28, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of 
Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on August 9, 2011, and DOHA received his answer 
on August 18, 2011. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 28, 
2011. The case was assigned to me on October 14, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing on October 17, 2011, scheduling the hearing for November 3, 2011. The 
hearing was held as scheduled. 
2 
 
At the hearing, the Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, 
which were received without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A 
through L, which were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 14, 2011. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correct the debt amounts 
alleged as follows: SOR ¶ 1a: $687,000 to $68,700; SOR ¶ 1j: $687,000 to $68,700; 
SOR ¶ 1k: $614,000 to $61,400; and SOR ¶ 1l: $530,000 to $53,000. Without objection 
from the Applicant, I granted Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 10-11.) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1c through 1i, and denied the remaining allegations. 
His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. 
 
Background Information 
 
 Applicant is a 52-year-old escort monitor, who seeks a security clearance as a 
condition of his employment. If granted a clearance, Applicant anticipates being 
deployed to Afghanistan. (GE 1, Tr. 17-19.) 
 
 Applicant graduated from high school in June 1978. He attended college and 
earned approximately 67 college credits. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from April 
1980 to April 1984, and was honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5). His 
military occupational specialty was 98K (signals collection/identification analyst). While 
on active duty, Applicant successfully held a top secret clearance with access to 
sensitive compartmented information (TS SCI). He also served in the U.S. Army 
Reserve in the “mid ‘90s” for “a year” and successfully held a secret security clearance. 
(GE 1, Tr. 20-25.) 
 
 Applicant was previously married four times. He was married to his first wife from 
December 1988 to March 1993; he was married to his second wife from September 
1994 to December 1997; he was married to his third wife from November 2003 to 
September 2005; and he was married to his fourth wife from July 2007 to July 2010. All 
marriages ended by divorce. Applicant is currently not married. He has one child – a 15-
year-old daughter born during his first marriage, and he pays her mother $229.50 in 
monthly child support. (GE 1, Tr. 25-29.) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 12 debts that relate to a combination of real estate 
holdings that went bad and consumer debt. In 1998, Applicant began investing in real 
estate and by 2003 he had acquired 13 properties. As a result of: (1) bad business 
decisions; (2) failed marriages, particularly his last two marriages; and (3) a depressed 
3 
 
real estate market, he encountered financial difficulties. Eight of his properties went into 
foreclosure, and the remaining five properties have been charged off. (Tr. 12-14, 30-38.) 
 
After losing eight properties to foreclosure and after discussing the tax 
implications with his accountant for the remaining five properties (two duplexes and 
three single family homes), Applicant decided to let those five properties go to 
foreclosure. However, after foreclosure proceedings were initiated, the lender filed 
dismissal notices for all five properties and “charged off” the properties. According to 
Applicant, the lender essentially told him, “we don’t want them back.” Applicant is 
attempting to repair these properties, settle property tax arrearages, and rent them out. 
He estimated that he spent $5,000 to $6,000 in repair bills and travel expenses 
attempting to get the properties to an acceptable rental condition. All properties are 
rented; however, Applicant is not making any payments to the lenders. (Tr. 38-42, 61-
62, AE L.) 
 
The status of the alleged SOR debts is summarized as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1a – This is a foreclosed property with a balance due of $68,700 following 
foreclosure. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 43, AE A.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1b – This is a collection account in the amount of $116,000 owed to the 
lender on a property. Applicant has a tenant in the property who is paying him $600 in 
monthly rent. The lender offered to pay the Applicant $1,000 if he would sign the 
property over to the lender. Negotiations are ongoing. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 43-
44, AE B.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1c through 1e and 1i – These are four collection accounts for credit 
cards in the respective amounts of $13,000, $16,000, $16,000, and $3,704. Applicant 
wanted to group these accounts together since they are all owed to the same creditor, 
and he is attempting to negotiate one settlement for these accounts. Applicant 
anticipates that he can settle these accounts for a fraction of the amount, but will only 
do so if he has a job because he does not want to deplete his cash reserve. These 
debts are not resolved. (Tr. 45-52, 68-73, AE C, AE D, AE H.)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1f through 1h and 1k – These were initially foreclosed properties with 
respective balances due of $54,000, $58,000, $62,000, and $61,400 following 
foreclosure. These debts stem from four of the five properties that Applicant still 
possesses. They are now charged-off accounts. Applicant has reached agreements to 
pay down the back property taxes owed. Although agreements have been reached with 
regard to back property taxes, nothing has been done to resolve the charged-off 
amounts of the loans. These debts are not resolved. (Tr. 51-56, 58-59, AE E – G, AE J.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1j – This is a foreclosure property with a balance due of $68,700 that the 
lender took back. The lender issued Applicant a Form 1099 “a couple of years ago” for 
the difference in income. Applicant does not remember the amount on the Form 1099. 
This debt  is resolved insofar as Applicant no longer has possession of the property and 
was issued a Form 1099. (Tr. 56-58, AE I.) 
4 
 
SOR ¶ 1l - This is a foreclosure property with a balance due of $53,000 that the 
lender took back. This property sold at auction in 2008 for $61,409 so there is no 
deficiency owed. The lender issued Applicant a Form 1099. This debt is resolved insofar 
as Applicant no longer has possession of the property and was issued a Form 1099. 
(Tr. 59-60, AE K.) 
 
Of the eight properties that the lender took back, Applicant estimates that 
“probably half of them had deficiencies” for which he was provided Forms 1099. (Tr. 
61.)  In 2007, Applicant made a decision based on the declining real estate market not 
to make any further mortgage payments on his 13 properties. The foreclosures of the 
eight properties discussed above took place “sometime [in] 2008 or 2009.” (Tr. 65.) 
Applicant is receiving rent for the five properties he still owns and is using those 
proceeds as living expenses as well as for upkeep and maintenance of those 
properties. (Tr. 74-77.) Applicant owns his personal residence and vehicles free and 
clear. (Tr. 77-79.) Applicant offered evidence that he had settled for a lesser amount two 
other credit card debts not alleged with balances of $26,500 and $27,000. (Tr. 50-51, 
AE C.) Before 2007, Applicant described his credit as “outstanding.” (Tr. 88.) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant did not submit any character evidence. 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
5 
 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  Under Guideline F, the concern is that an Applicant’s failure or inability to live 
within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-
control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which 
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG ¶ 18.) 
 
 Applicant accumulated 12 debts primarily related to 13 investment real estate 
properties. As a result of the declining real estate market, he chose to stop making 
payments on those properties. He lost eight of those properties to foreclosure and the 
lender charged off the remaining five properties. Applicant’s history of indebtedness is 
well documented. AG ¶ 19(a): “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and AG ¶ 
19(c): “a history of not meeting financial obligations” apply. 
 
6 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because there 
is more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. Therefore, 
his debt is “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. 
See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-
03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  
 
Under AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant receives partial credit because of the declining real 
estate market, but his choice to cease making payments on all 13 properties in 2007 
precludes full application of this mitigating condition.  Furthermore, he has not made any 
payments on the five properties that the bank charged off. He continues to receive rent 
for those properties.  Applicant has to demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. Although his “business decisions,” may be acceptable in some 
situations, they are not considered acceptable in the context for one seeking a security 
clearance. There is little evidence that Applicant remained in contact with his creditors 
or tried to make minimum payments during this time.1
 
  
                                                          
1 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside 
his control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner 
when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he 
maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his debts 
current. 
7 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant did not seek financial counseling. 
Likewise, there is not sufficient evidence in the record to establish full mitigation under 
AG ¶ 20(d).2
 
 Despite receiving rent on his five remaining properties, Applicant is doing 
the bare minimum to satisfy the local tax authority. Applicant offered little evidence that 
he had made or is making a good-faith effort to repay his creditors or otherwise resolve 
his debts and his conduct is not indicative of “good-faith” effort as contemplated by the 
Directive.  AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable because Applicant does not dispute the validity 
of the debts alleged. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
The comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the 
whole-person concept analysis. Applicant continues to have a substantial amount of 
delinquent debt. I have taken into account Applicant’s honorable military service and the 
fact that he successfully held security clearances. I also acknowledge that he 
                                                          
 
2 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option in order to 
claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
 
maintained an acceptable level of financial responsibility before 2007. However, his 
choice to become an owner and landlord of numerous properties entailed a certain 
degree of risk. Applicant’s plan did not materialize as anticipated, and he is now heavily 
leveraged. Given the tenuous nature of his financial situation, I cannot in good 
conscience state with certainty that he is a good candidate for a security clearance at 
the present time. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the 
facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude he has 
not mitigated security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative 
process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. 
Applicant has not fully mitigated or overcome the Government’s case. For the reasons 
stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1a – 1h:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1j:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1k:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1l:   For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
