GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 17, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on July 12, 2011.2
                                                          
1 Item 4 (SF 86), dated November 17, 2010. 
 On September 15, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
 
2 Item 5 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated July 12, 2011).

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 21, 2011. In a sworn 
statement, dated October 11, 2011,3
 
 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
January 3, 2012, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after 
receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on January 13, 2012, but as of February 12, 
2012, he had not submitted any further documents or other information. The case was 
assigned to me on February 27, 2012. 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted only one (¶ 1.a.) of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR. He denied the remaining 
allegations (¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.) of the SOR. Applicant’s admission is incorporated herein 
as a finding of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 68-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since August 
1990, has been serving as an analyst. He has held a Top Secret security clearance 
since January 1964.4 He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July 1960, and served on active 
duty until July 1990, when he retired with an honorable discharge.5 No other information 
regarding Applicant’s military service was provided. Information regarding Applicant’s 
education, other than the fact that he does not have a college degree,6
 
 was not 
furnished.  
Applicant was married in July 1966, and divorced in February 1977.7 He married 
his second wife in February 1977.8 He has four children, born in July 1974, October 
1977, July 1980, and October 1982, respectively.9

Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties, but it 
appears that they may have commenced sometime between 1996 and 2000.10 Two 
federal tax liens were filed against him in 1996, totaling $33,143,11 and a state tax lien 
was filed against him in 1996, in the amount of $12,693.12 The smaller of the two federal 
tax liens was satisfied in November 1996.13 Applicant acknowledged that he had not 
filed federal or state income taxes since around 2000.14 A federal tax lien was filed 
against him in 2003, in the amount of $12,623.15 That lien was satisfied in September 
2007.16 Another federal tax lien was filed against him in 2005, in the amount of 
$28,634.17 That lien was satisfied in May 2008.18 An additional federal tax lien (SOR ¶ 
1.a.) was filed against him in 2010, in the amount of $159,854.19 In November 2007, a 
civil judgment was awarded against Applicant for default on a time-share agreement, 
and a lien was filed, in the amount of $6,792 (SOR ¶ 1.c.).20 That lien was satisfied in 
April 2010.21
 
  
Applicant also had a mortgage and several credit cards become delinquent 
throughout the years.22 He claimed the accounts became delinquent and the tax returns 
were not filed because he did not have sufficient funds to pay them,23

described any conditions beyond his control that might have led to his financial 
difficulties. In about 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) placed a garnishment on 
his salary, and took approximately $3,500 per month. The process ended in about 2008, 
by which time the IRS had garnished about $60,000.24 In about 2007, the state placed a 
garnishment on his salary, and took approximately $200 per month.25 As of December 
2010, he contends the balance owed was reduced to around $5,000,26
 
 but he offered 
no documentation to support his contention. 
In July 2011, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a total 
annual net income of $154,970, including his salary, his spouse’s salary, his military 
retirement, and his social security benefits.27 He claimed $3,200 in monthly expenses, 
as well as $5,104 in other financial obligations, including debt payments, tax consultant 
fees, and mortgage payments.28
 
 Using his numbers, he should have approximately 
$4,610 left over each month for discretionary spending or savings.  
In mid-2010, Applicant engaged the services of a tax consultant firm to negotiate 
with the IRS in an effort to obtain a settlement of about $120,000.29 As of March 2011, 
he had paid his tax consultants approximately $4,200.30 However, it is unclear if that 
amount is for payment of professional services or for actually reducing Applicant’s IRS 
liability. Applicant also claimed that he had hired a tax service to file his 2001 through 
2010 tax returns, but he has offered no documentary evidence to support his claim of 
any such activity. In July 2010, despite his financial delinquencies, Applicant and his 
wife took a cruise through the Inside Passage of Canada and Alaska.31
 
  
The SOR identified three purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $172,707. Those delinquencies are a federal tax lien, a state tax lien, and 
a judgment. The federal tax lien is not resolved; the state tax lien is purportedly in the 
process of being resolved through garnishment; and the judgment has been resolved. 
 
Despite Applicant’s claims that he has hired both a tax consultant and a tax 
service, he has offered no evidence to indicate that he has ever received financial 
counseling in money management, debt management, debt repayment, or budgeting.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”32 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”33
 
   
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view tshe guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”34 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.35
 
  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

33 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified.    
 
34 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”36
 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”37
 
 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. In addition, under AG ¶ 19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same,” is also 
potentially disqualifying. As noted above, on numerous occasions between 1996 and 
2010, Applicant failed to file federal or state income tax returns, and both the IRS and 
the state were forced to file tax liens and take garnishment actions in order to obtain the 
                                                          
36 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
37 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
7 
                                      
 
delinquent balances. In fact, the payment of taxes is separate and apart from the 
requirement that income tax returns be filed annually, something Applicant routinely 
failed to do. In addition, several accounts, including a mortgage, became delinquent, 
and a judgment and resulting lien were filed against Applicant by another creditor. AG 
¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@38
 
  
 AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of 
Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties and failures to file federal and state income 
tax returns between 1996 and 2010 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long 
ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant offered only a generic comment about 
“insufficient funds” causing his inability to file his tax returns. In light of his lengthy period 
of continuing financial problems, and still owing the IRS nearly $160,000, it is unlikely 
that they will be resolved in the short term, and they are likely to recur. Accordingly, 
Applicant failed to mitigate his financial situation, and under the circumstances, his 
actions do cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.39
 
   
AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(c) do not apply because there is no evidence that 
Appellant’s financial situation was, in any way, caused by circumstances that were 
                                                          
38 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

beyond his control. His sole explanation was that he had insufficient funds, but he never 
explained how or why that condition existed. Also, there is no evidence to indicate 
Applicant has ever received counseling in money management, debt management, debt 
repayment, or budgeting.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies. Applicant had his salary garnished by the IRS and 
the state government, but those actions do not qualify as “good-faith” efforts. His federal 
tax lien, in the amount of $159,000, is still pending, and Applicant’s only effort regarding 
resolution occurred in mid-2010, when Applicant engaged the services of a tax 
consultant firm to negotiate with the IRS in an effort to obtain a settlement of about 
$120,000. He offered no documentary evidence to support his claim, other than a 
statement for unspecified services. In this regard, Applicant’s statements regarding his 
efforts or future intent to resolve his IRS lien and his promise to file his delinquent tax 
returns, without corroborating documentary evidence, are entitled to little weight.40
 
 The 
civil judgment against him in November 2007, as well as the lien against him for default 
on a time-share agreement, in the amount of $6,792, were finally satisfied in April 2010, 
and his eventual resolution of that account, after three years, does qualify as a “good-
faith” effort.  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.41
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: Although he 
had not filed federal or state income tax during the period 1996 through 2010, he did 
       
                                                          
40 See ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). 
41 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

eventually resolve some of the tax liens filed against him. He also resolved the civil 
judgment and lien against him for default on a time-share agreement. His state tax lien 
is being paid by garnishment. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has a long history of not filing federal or state income tax returns and 
generating other financial delinquencies. He seemingly does not pay his accounts, but 
prefers to have the legal system do so for him by way of liens and garnishments. His 
claims of “insufficient funds” are unsubstantiated, and given his recent cruise and 
substantial monthly remainder for discretionary spending, Applicant could have made 
some efforts to resolve his accounts in a more timely fashion. Applicant’s actions 
indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and 
regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability 
to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
