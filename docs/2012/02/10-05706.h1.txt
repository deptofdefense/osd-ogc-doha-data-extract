Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows that in 2006
Applicant and his wife purchased four town homes as a real estate investment. The
investment failed due to a combination of a steep drop in market value, vacancy
problems, reduced rental rates, maintenance costs, and vandalism costs. Applicant
incurred a large amount of credit card debt in an effort to keep things afloat, but
eventually decided bankruptcy was the best course of action. His initial Chapter 13
bankruptcy case was filed in late 2009 and dismissed before confirmation of a
repayment plan in 2010. He filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case about a month
later in October 2010, and it is pending confirmation by the bankruptcy court. He has
paid about $27,000 under the proposed plan during the last year. There are now clear
indications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control, and he
has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. For the reasons discussed below,
this case is decided for Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on or about April1
11, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline
known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing.
Subsequently, he changed his mind and requested a hearing on July 26, 2011. The
case was assigned to another judge on September 15, 2011, before it was assigned to
me on October 14, 2011. The hearing took place November 1, 2011. The hearing
transcript (Tr.) was received November 10, 2011. 
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, the first filed in 2009 but
dismissed before confirmation in 2010, and the second filed in 2010 and pending. It also
alleged nine delinquent accounts, which included four mortgage loans, for a total of
about $380,000. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with
explanations. His admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated herein as
findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial
evidence. 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been
employed as a senior subcontracts administrator for a large company engaged in
defense contracting since 2005. He is seeking to retain a security clearance at the
secret level. His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree. He has been
married for 31 years, and he and his wife have a 16-year-old son. His gross annual
salary is about $121,000, while his wife earns a gross annual salary of about $85,000
working as a public school teacher.  Their current monthly expenditures do not exceed2
their income and show a monthly net income or remainder of about $1,669.  3

Applicant has had a uneven employment history over the years with job layoffs
and periods of unemployment.  He worked previously for his current employer for about4
11 years during 1986–1997. More recently, he was unemployed from November 2002
to September 2005. It was during this period of unemployment that Applicant began
taking courses and studying real estate investment. He took it a step further in 2005 by
forming his own real estate investment company and operated the same for a few
months until beginning his current job in November 2005. 
Applicant made no real estate investments until 2006, when he was contacted by
a firm with an offer to purchase rental town homes in a neighboring state. He traveled to
that state, met with the seller, and inspected the proposed properties. After returning
home and discussing it with his wife, he decided to purchase four town homes as rental
properties. He made a $5,000 down payment for each property and obtained mortgage
loans to finance the balances. His investment quickly proved to be problematic. It failed
due to a combination of a steep drop in market value, vacancy problems, reduced rental
rates, maintenance costs, and vandalism costs. Indeed, the four town homes are
located in one of the states hardest hit by the bursting of the real estate bubble.  He5
incurred a large amount of credit card debt in an effort to keep things afloat, but
eventually decided bankruptcy was the best course of action. 
Applicant’s initial Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was filed in late 2009, and it was
dismissed before confirmation of a repayment plan in 2010. In February 2010, he self-
reported his financial problems and pending bankruptcy case to his company’s facility
security officer.  As a result, he was interviewed by an investigator in April 2010.   6 7
Applicant filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in October 2010, and it was
pending confirmation by the bankruptcy court at the time of the hearing. The details of
the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case include ten creditors listed under Schedule F as
unsecured nonpriority claims for a total of about $326,802.  Of those ten creditors,8
seven are for credit card accounts. The largest claim is related to Applicant’s real estate
investment; it is described as a cancellation of debt for $239,449. 
The pending Chapter 13 bankruptcy case proposed that Applicant enter into a
60-month repayment plan and pay $2,000 for one month and $1,600 monthly
thereafter.  At hearing, a plan was not yet confirmed by the bankruptcy court, but9

Applicant has made monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee since November
2010.  His initial payment was for $2,000, and thereafter he has made monthly10
payments of $2,300. As of November 1, 2011, he has paid about $27,000 into the
proposed plan.   
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As11
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt12
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An13
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  14
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting15
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An16
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate17
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme18
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it21
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant22
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline23
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  24
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.

Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. The evidence also raises security concerns because it indicates
an inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within25 26
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions.  
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;27
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
 AG ¶ 2(e)(1). 28
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).29
7
I considered all the mitigating conditions, and the most pertinent here are AG ¶¶ 20(c)
and (d). Taken together, along with the other favorable evidence, they are sufficient to
overcome and mitigate the security concerns.  
The evidence shows Applicant speculated in the real estate market by buying
four rental town homes in a neighboring state. The investment failed due to a
combination of circumstances. He attempted to keep his investment afloat by incurring
debt on credit card accounts until he decided the best course of action was to seek
relief via Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. Unlike a Chapter 7 case that allows a
debtor to discharge his indebtedness without repayment, a Chapter 13 case requires a
debtor to repay creditors under a court-approved plan. Although such a plan was not yet
confirmed in Applicant’s case, he has nevertheless made monthly payments under the
proposed plan since November 2010 for a total about $27,000, which will be credited
toward his plan upon confirmation. Given these circumstances, it is fair to conclude that
there are now clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are being resolved or
are under control, and he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. His
payment of about $27,000 in monthly payments over the course of a year is substantial
evidence that he will continue to make payments when the bankruptcy court approves
the plan. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Applicant and his wife appear to
have sufficient income to make the monthly payment. 
In addition, Applicant, who is a current clearance holder, receives credit in
mitigation for self-reporting his financial problems in February 2010.  As a result, he put28
the Government on notice of his problematic financial situation. He also cooperated with
the investigation that resulted from his self-report. These circumstances demonstrate a
willingness to follow the rules for properly handling and safeguarding classified
information. In other words, by self-reporting his financial problems, and thereby
subjecting himself to a formal investigation, he demonstrated a willingness to report a
potential security infraction or violation even if doing so might jeopardize his job or his
standing with his employer or some other personal interest. His willingness to
subordinate his interests to that of the Government reflects well on his judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness. 
 
Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I have no doubts or
concerns about Applicant’s fitness or suitability for a security clearance. In reaching this
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the
whole-person concept.  Having done so, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate29
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for
Applicant.

Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.k: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
