MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant lost a home to foreclosure, on which he owes a second mortgage of 
$12,512. While some of his financial problems can be attributed to his spouse’s medical 
issues and her abuse of his credit, he defaulted on $9,041 in student loan debt, and a 
$3,098 judgment was issued against him for an unpaid medical debt. Applicant has since 
repaid the judgment, but he has yet to resolve other debts because he has chosen to pay 
$800 per month in tuition for his son to attend private school. Clearance denied. 
 
 Statement of the Case  
 
On July 25, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations, which provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny 
him a security clearance. DOHA took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
 
 2 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on September 23, 2011, and he requested 
a decision without a hearing. On October 18, 2011, the Government submitted a File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a copy 
of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. 
Applicant elected not to respond by the November 30, 2011 due-date, and on January 19, 
2012, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleged under Guideline F that as of July 25, 2011, Applicant owed several 
delinquent accounts:  a $3,908 judgment filed against him in June 2006 (SOR 1.a); medical 
debts of $90 (SOR 1.b) and $1,456 (SOR 1.c); a $65 collection debt (SOR 1.d); a charged-
off bank debt of $810 (SOR 1.f); a $12,512 mortgage loan in foreclosure (SOR 1.g); and 
student loans of $4,483 (SOR 1.h) and $5,755 (SOR 1.i). In his Answer, Applicant denied 
the judgment on the basis it had been paid, and the student loan debts because they were 
out of collections. He disputed the medical debt in SOR 1.c without explanation. Applicant 
admitted the debts in SOR 1.b and 1.d through 1.g. After considering the Government’s 
FORM, including Applicant’s Answer (Item 3), I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old information systems technician with an associate’s 
degree. He has been employed by a defense contractor since May 2008 and seeks his first 
security clearance. (Item 4.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse have been married since June 1996. They have a son, 
who was born in September 1996, a few months after their marriage. Applicant also has a 
daughter, who was born in December 2006. (Item 4.) He pays child support around $458 
per month. (Items 5, 7.) 
 
In January 2003, Applicant bought a house. He took out a primary mortgage of 
$80,000 and a second mortgage (SOR 1.g) of $20,000. Following a job layoff in April 2003, 
Applicant was unemployed until August 2003. He fell behind in his mortgage payments and 
struggled to catch up after he began working as a systems analyst for a private company. 
Around April 2004, Applicant enrolled in a local university to further his education. He took 
out two federal student loans of $3,459 (SOR 1.h) and $5,582 (SOR 1.i). 
 
Around 2005, Applicant’s spouse had mental health issues that led to her 
hospitalization. In addition to incurring these unforeseen medical expenses, Applicant’s 
spouse gambled addictively and spent excessively after her discharge. Not counting the 
medical expenses, Applicant estimates she incurred debt around $12,000, about $5,000 on 
his employer-sponsored credit card account. (Item 6.) 
 
 
 3 
Applicant made a last payment on his mortgages in March 2005. His primary lender 
filed to foreclose on his property in May 2006 when his loan had a $79,741 principal 
balance. (Items 6, 8.) Around February 2007, the house was redeemed to settle at least 
the primary mortgage. Applicant reportedly owed $12,512 on the second mortgage (SOR 
1.g).
1
 He felt fortunate to have food on his table (Item 6), and he did not continue his 
education after May 2005. (Item 4.) 
 
Between 2005 and 2007, several medical debts totaling $2,200 were referred for 
collection. Applicant paid medical debts of $26 and $528 after collection, but debts of $100 
(not alleged), $90 (SOR 1.b), and $1,456 (SOR 1.c), remained unpaid as of April 2010. 
(Items 7, 8.) In March 2006, Applicant issued an insufficient funds check. A $40 debt was 
referred for collection (SOR 1.d). In June 2006, a $3,908 judgment was issued against 
Applicant for unpaid medical debt incurred by his spouse (SOR 1.a). In September 2006, 
Applicant and his spouse incurred a joint $810 debt to their bank for a returned check 
(SOR 1.f). (Items 6, 8.) 
 
Due in part to his spouse’s spending, Applicant and his wife temporarily separated in 
2006. Applicant cohabited with the mother of his daughter for a short time in the summer of 
2006 (Item 4), and he filed for divorce from his spouse in October 2006. However, he and 
his spouse subsequently reconciled. (Item 6.) 
 
Applicant was terminated from his job in April 2007 when someone complained that 
he was not working the full 40 hour work week. He was unemployed until August 2007 and 
could not afford to repay his delinquent debt. (Items 4-8.) From August 2007 to April 2008, 
Applicant worked as a service technician for a cash register company. (Item 4.) In 2008, 
Applicant’s student loans came out of deferment, but he made no payments when they 
came due, even after landing a job with his current employer in April 2008. An $11,417 
aggregate balance was placed for collection. As of September 2010, Applicant owed 
$4,434 on one loan (SOR 1.h) and $6,681 on the other loan (SOR 1.i.). (Item 8.) 
 
On October 25, 2010, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He responded affirmatively to the financial record 
questions concerning any repossession or foreclosures, judgments, debts turned over for 
collection, accounts charged off, wage garnishments, counseling for violating terms of an 
employer-provided travel or credit card, debts over 180 days delinquent, debts currently 
over 90 days past-due, and delinquent federal debts. He indicated that he had satisfied the 
judgment debt (SOR 1.a) in April 2010, and that he was trying to work out a payment 
agreement on his delinquent second mortgage (SOR 1.g). His primary lender foreclosed on 
his home because he could not afford to pay the variable rate mortgage. Applicant 
indicated that he paid off the $5,000 debt incurred through misuse of the employer-
sponsored credit card account. As for his student loan debt (SOR 1.h and 1.i), Applicant 
indicated that he made a first payment on October 22, 2010, under a recently arranged 
repayment plan. Applicant maintained that his child support was current, that he was 
                                                 
1
Available credit reports (Items 7, 8) show a $12,512 past-due balance on the mortgage. His November 2010 
consolidated credit report indicates that the credit grantor reclaimed the collateral to settle the debt. (Item 8.) 
As of April 2011, Equifax was reporting a $12,512 balance on a charged off account in foreclosure.  
 
 4 
making payments on multiple medical bills totaling $8,000. However, he had not satisfied 
the $810 charge-off debt ($800 on e-QIP) incurred for overdrawing his bank account (SOR 
2.f). (Item 4.) 
 
As of November 13, 2010, Applicant’s credit record revealed that he owed some 
debts in collection that were not listed on his e-QIP (SOR 1.b through 1.e). Disposition of 
the judgment debt (SOR 1.a) was listed as “unknown.” Applicant had paid off a $10,958 car 
loan in August 2004, and he was making timely payments on a $968 loan taken out in April 
2010. The balance of the loan was $535. (Item 8.) 
 
On December 6, 2010, an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) interviewed Applicant about his financial delinquencies. Applicant 
admitted that he fell behind in his $770 monthly rent in 2009 because his spouse was out 
of work for six months due to medical issues. He was paying $1,000 per month to his 
landlord to catch up. Applicant indicated that in October 2010, he began working 32 hours 
per week as night stocker at a supermarket while maintaining his full-time day employment 
with the defense contractor. Applicant attributed his delinquencies to unemployment and 
his spouse’s mental health issues, which led her to max out his company credit card. His 
wages were garnished by the grantor employer until the $5,000 debt was satisfied around 
January 2007. After a creditor attempted to attach his pay to recover its default judgment, 
Applicant paid $100 per month until January 2010, when the debt was paid off. Applicant 
admitted that he had made no payments toward his delinquent second mortgage (SOR 
1.g) since the foreclosure. Applicant attributed his student loan default to his mistaken 
belief that the loans had been deferred for five instead of four years. After he was 
contacted by a collection agency, he arranged to pay $465 per month starting in October 
2010. Applicant also claimed that he had paid off the $810 bank debt (SOR 1.f) around 
2006. Applicant indicated that he did not realize that he owed around $64 for his old 
landline telephone (SOR 1.e) or $70 for a returned check (SOR 1.d), but he would look into 
them. Concerning a $1,456 medical debt listed on his credit record, Applicant explained 
that the debt was from a medical procedure, which had a “set” price of $200 that he paid. 
In November 2006, Applicant learned that the creditor was seeking $1,456 from him (SOR 
1.c). He was disputing the validity of the debt. Applicant expressed his hope that with his 
second job, his debts would be paid off within eight months. (Item 6.) 
 
As of April 18, 2011, Equifax was reporting no progress toward resolving the 
disputed medical debt (SOR 1.c), the $70 balance for the returned check (SOR 1.d), the 
$65 debt for his old landline account (SOR 1.e), the $810 bank debt (SOR 1.f), or the 
$12,512 balance of his defaulted second mortgage (SOR 1.g). His credit report also did not 
show any payments on his student loans, which had balances of $4,483 (SOR 1.h) and 
$6,755 (SOR 1.i) as of March 2011. The current status of the judgment debt (SOR 1.a) 
was not reported. (Item 7.) 
 
On June 1, 2011, Applicant acknowledged to DOHA that he had not been able to 
make any payments on his defaulted second mortgage (SOR 1.g) because he has been 
making payments on his and his spouse’s student loans, medical bills, and other past-due 
accounts. He had also made no payments on the $810 bank debt (SOR 1.f), inasmuch as 
 
 5 
it was charged off.
2 
Applicant indicated that he would satisfy the $65 landline debt (SOR 
1.e) by July 15, 2011, and the $70 returned check charge (SOR 1.d) within the next 30 
days. He had been unable to identify the creditor reportedly owed the $90 medical debt 
(SOR 1.b). Applicant disputed the $1,456 medical debt (SOR 1.c) with the collection 
agency handling that account, but he had received no response from the assignee. He 
maintained that his student loans had been rehabilitated as of May 28, 2011, so they were 
in good standing. Applicant estimated that after paying monthly expenses, which included 
$800 per month in private school tuition for their son, he and his spouse had $300.67 in 
discretionary income. Applicant indicated that it would take him another 18 to 24 months to 
bring all his accounts in good standing. (Item 5.) 
 
As of September 23, 2011, Applicant had made no payments on the undisputed 
debts identified in SOR 1.b and 1.d through 1.g. He had made no payments toward the 
disputed $1,456 medical debt (SOR 1.c). He asserted that he had satisfied the judgment 
debt in SOR 1.a, and that he had rehabilitated his student loans (SOR 1.h and 1.i), 
although he presented no evidence showing payments. Applicant expressed his intent to 
continue to resolve his undisputed debts, but it was taking him longer to pay off his debts 
because of the cost of private school tuition (“I send my son to private school because of 
the lack of quality education in the public school system.”). (Item 3.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
                                                 
2 
In his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant referenced an attachment to show that his account 
was charged off and closed. The interrogatory response provided to me for review (Item 5) does not 
include any attachments. However, his November 13, 2010 credit report (Item 8) shows the account as 
closed and charged off to profit and loss. 
 
 6 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Guideline F notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG ¶ 19(a), 
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” are established. Applicant defaulted on mortgages for his home. The 
first mortgage was settled by the foreclosing lender redeeming the property, but the second 
mortgage has been past-due since 2005. Several medical debts were referred for 
collection between 2005 and 2007. While Applicant denied SOR 1.a on the basis of 
repayment, he does not dispute the default judgment of $3,908 entered against him in 
June 2006. Applicant or his spouse issued a bad check of $40, for which Applicant is 
legally liable in the amount of $70. A $65 balance on an old landline account is still in 
collection. Bank account overdraft charges of $810 have been charged off by the financial 
institution, but Applicant does not dispute that he and his spouse incurred the debt. 
Moreover, Applicant’s student loans went into default in 2008 for failure to make payments 
when they came out of deferment. Efforts on Applicant’s part to rehabilitate the loans could 
 
 7 
implicate mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c) or ¶ 20(d) or both, but he also admitted, and his 
credit reports show, that his student loans went into collection. 
 
Applicant acknowledges that his spouse underwent a medical procedure that 
obligated him financially to the provider represented in SOR 1.c. However, he has 
consistently denied that he owes an outstanding debt of $1,456 as alleged, contending that 
he paid the $200 cost for the procedure set before it was performed. The listing of the debt 
on Applicant’s credit record, as a $1,456 outstanding balance from November 2006 
referred for collection in July 2007 (Items 7, 8), is sufficient to establish the Government’s 
burden of establishing the controverted debt.
3
 
 
 Concerning potentially mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so 
long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment,” cannot reasonably apply, given the absence of any progress toward resolving 
the debts identified in SOR 1.b through 1.g. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” applies to the extent that his financial problems can be attributed 
to his spouse’s mental health issues and unemployment. Applicant’s pay was garnished to 
repay $5,000 in credit card debt incurred by his spouse on his employer-sponsored credit 
card. Medical expenses, including those in SOR 1.a through 1.c, were in all likelihood not 
discretionary. Yet, AG ¶ 20(b) does not mitigate Applicant’s default of his student loans. 
Applicant had an obligation to know when his student loans came out of deferment, and to 
seek hardship forbearance if he could not afford to make payments. Nor does AG ¶ 20(b) 
mitigate Applicant’s ongoing failure to address his mortgage debt. Applicant admitted to the 
OPM investigator that he had been “sitting on the debt” since the foreclosure of his house. 
He averred that he had recently discussed a payment plan and would begin to repay the 
debt at $250 per month starting January 2011. As of late September 2011, Applicant had 
made no payments. Similarly, he told DOHA in June 2011 that he would pay the $65 
landline debt by July 15, 2011. As of late September 2011, the debt had not been paid, 
even though he had net discretionary income of $300 per month. While it is 
understandable that Applicant would want the best education for his son, his expenditure of 
$800 per month in private school tuition is difficult to justify when creditors are not being 
repaid. 
 
 Despite the lack of corroborating evidence, the Government is not disputing 
Applicant’s claim that he satisfied the $3,908 judgment debt at $100 per month after the 
creditor initiated garnishment action. As of April 2011, the judgment was still on Applicant’s 
                                                 
3
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial evidence,” which is “such relevant 
evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary 
evidence in the record.” ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. 
Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
 8 
credit record but with no information about it being paid or not. Assuming the debt has 
been satisfied, actions taken in response to a court judgment are not entitled to full weight 
in mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” According to Applicant, his student loans were 
rehabilitated as of May 28, 2011. While it is conceivable that the loans would continue to 
be reported as delinquent until they were brought current, Applicant had an opportunity to 
document his good-faith efforts to rehabilitate the loans, and he presented no such 
evidence. In light of his failure to make the payments on his mortgage loan that were 
reportedly to commence in January 2011, I concur with the Government that some 
corroboration of his student loan repayments is required before his loan default is mitigated 
under either AG ¶ 20(d) or AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control.” Applicant admits that he has made no payments toward the undisputed 
debts in SOR 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e, which are under $100 and appear to be within his means to 
satisfy. Neither AG ¶ 20(c) nor AG ¶ 20(d) applies to those debts. As for the $810 in 
outstanding past-due bank account overdraft charges, the financial judgment concerns 
persist even if the creditor wrote off the debt to profit and loss. 
 
 As for the disputed $1,456 medical debt alleged in SOR 1.c, Applicant has not 
provided evidence that would establish AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis 
to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue.” Had Applicant submitted evidence of a billing or insurance 
statement showing his liability was only $200, or proof of his claimed $200 payment, he 
could have gone a long way toward challenging the validity of the debt. His uncorroborated 
assertions are insufficient to apply AG ¶ 20(e). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
4
 
 
Applicant’s financial difficulties were caused in part by factors outside of his control. 
That being said, he has a responsibility to repay his creditors for debt incurred by him or in 
his name. An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every 
debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that 
                                                 
4 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 9 
an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 
at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). That being said, he has indicated that he would be making 
payments on some debts in the past and not made good on those promises, apparently 
because his finances are strained by $800 in monthly tuition for his son’s private schooling. 
Even if I accept his uncorroborated claim of rehabilitation of his student loans, Applicant 
has not shown that he has a reasonable plan in place to address his sizeable mortgage 
debt. Based on the available evidence, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
