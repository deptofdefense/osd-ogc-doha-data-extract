HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial consideration security concerns. His 1997 
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy was not recent. He paid or settled and paid the ten debts listed 
on the statement of reasons (SOR). He does not currently have any delinquent debt. 
Clearance is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 1, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). 
On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an 
issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility 
for access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of 
Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as 
amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
In January 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on 
January 30, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 31, 2009. On February 18, 
2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 11, 2009. At the 
hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits (GEs 1-9) (Transcript (Tr.) 20-22), 
and Applicant offered five exhibits (Tr. 23-25; AE A-E). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 22), and AEs A-E (Tr. 26). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, 
response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 10-12). I received the transcript on 
March 17, 2009. I held the record open until March 18, 2009 (Tr. 74). I received AEs F, 
G, and H after the hearing and they were admitted without objection (Tr. 74; AE F, G, 
H). 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debts listed in 
the SOR, said he had paid the SOR debts; however, he was waiting for confirmatory 
documentation of the debt’s resolution (GE 12). His admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I 
make the following findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is 56 years old (Tr. 6). He graduated from high school in 1971 (Tr. 6). 
He did not attend college (Tr. 6). He currently has a top secret security clearance; 
however, he has previously held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive 
compartmented information (Tr. 7-8). He first received a security clearance in 1978, 
when he was serving on active duty as a U.S. Marine (Tr. 7).  He served in the U.S. 
Marines from March 1977 to May 1980 and then from April 1981 to May 1991 (Tr. 28-
29; GE 1). He left active duty as a noncommissioned officer (Tr. 29). He married in 
October 1980 and was separated from his spouse in October 2003 (Tr. 29). His divorce 
was final in July 2006 (Tr. 29).  
 
In the 1990s, Applicant had a medical problem similar to a stroke and was 
partially paralyzed (Tr. 37). He was an inpatient for about seven months and then 
received outpatient therapy about eight hours a day for four months (Tr. 37, 44-45). He 
received sixty percent of his pay while on long-term disability (Tr. 38). His debts became 
delinquent because of the loss of income. In 1997, his debts were discharged under a 
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a).   
 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
 
Applicant eventually recovered sufficiently to return to full employment. However, 
in January 2005, Applicant received an injury to his elbow and shoulder and again went 
on long-term disability (Tr. 33, 36). He received disability pay until January 2006 (Tr. 
35). Around June of 2005, a defense contractor hired Applicant for sporadic, part time 
employment (Tr. 33-34). He fell behind on his debts because he was only receiving sixty 
percent of his pay, while he was on long-term disability (Tr. 39-40).   
 
Applicant’s current employer has employed him for the last two years as a 
security agent (Tr. 30). His current employment is part time, usually about 32 hours a 
week; however, he also receives occasional overtime pay (Tr. 30-31; AE G). Applicant 
has full-time employment at another firm waiting, provided he receives a security 
clearance as a result of this proceeding (Tr. 32-33). He is not currently receiving any 
disability pay (Tr. 46).  
  
Financial considerations 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists a 1997 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy 
discharge of his debts (SOR ¶ 1.a) and ten delinquent debts, totaling $12,066 (SOR ¶¶ 
1.b to 1.k). In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he said he paid the SOR debts and was 
waiting for proof of payment (GE 12). Applicant established through his hearing 
statement and the following documents that his SOR debts were paid or settled and 
paid:  
 
(1) credit card judgment for $763 (SOR ¶ 1.b, Tr. 38-39, 68, AE G);  
 
(2) credit card judgment for $1,316 (SOR ¶ 1.c, Tr. 38-39, 69; AE A);  
 
(3) credit card debt for $2,858 (SOR ¶ 1.d, Tr. 40-41, 54, 69; AE C at 2);  
 
(4) credit card debt for $2,428 (SOR ¶ 1.e, Tr. 40-41, 54, 70; AE C at 3);  
 
(5) credit card charge for $29, which is part of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d (SOR ¶ 1.f, 
Tr. 40-41, 70; GE 12, AE G);  
 
(6) credit card debt for $2,951 (SOR ¶ 1.g, Tr. 42, 54-57, 71; AE C at 1, AE D);  
 
(7) credit card debt for $482 (SOR ¶ 1.h, Tr. 42-43, 71; AE B at 3);  
 
(8) credit card debt for $346, which is part of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h (SOR ¶ 1.i, 
Tr. 42-43, 71; AE B at 3, GE 12);  
 
(9) credit card debt for $251 (SOR ¶ 1.j, Tr. 43); and 
 
(10) credit card debt for $642 (SOR 1.k, Tr. 71-72; AE G, AE H). 
 
 
 
4 
 
 Applicant did not recognize one judgment for $498 filed on January 5, 2000 (Tr. 
58-59; GE 5). He recently paid the two SOR judgments for $1,316 and $763 filed in 
2004 (Tr. 60-61; SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c; GE 6 and 7).   
 
Applicant originally planned to use a credit counseling service (CCS) to resolve 
his SOR debts and he began CCS’ process of debt resolution in October 2008 (Tr. 47-
51; GR 8). He gave CCS about $500; however, CCS wanted him to contact all creditors 
and determine the amount of his debts (Tr. 48-49). After contacting his creditors, he 
chose to pay his debts without using that CCS’ services (Tr. 48-49). CCS has agreed to 
refund $487 to Applicant (Tr. 49).   
 
Applicant has not had any problems paying his rent (Tr. 62). He owns two 
vehicles and they are both paid off (Tr. 63). He has about $100 in savings (Tr. 63) and 
about $2,100 set aside for emergencies (AE H). He has two credit cards, one has $500 
on it and the other does not have any charges on it (Tr. 65). His credit cards are current 
(Tr. 66). He does not have any other credit accounts and all accounts, such as for 
utilities and cell phones are current (Tr. 66-67).  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
 
 
5 
 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR 
 
 
6 
 
response and at his hearing. In 1997, Applicant’s debts were discharged using Chapter 
7 Bankruptcy. As indicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.b to 1.k, he had ten delinquent debts totaling 
about $12,066. Several debts became delinquent as early as 2004. Several SOR debts 
were not paid until December 2008. The government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his ten delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because his financial problems “occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply 
because he did not dispute any of the SOR debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged due to medical 
problems, reduction of income while he was on disability, underemployment, 
unemployment, and divorce. He lacked the income to pay some of his debts. About two 
 
 
7 
 
                                           
years ago, he obtained his current employment and thereafter he paid his SOR debts. 
He established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.2  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) applies. Applicant received financial counseling. He paid his 
delinquent debts. Moreover, there are “clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control.” He understands the security implications of delinquent 
debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because Applicant showed good faith3 in the resolution of 
his SOR debts.    
 
Although Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts, his payment of the remaining SOR debts in 
December 2008 are adequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his 
debts current. 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
  There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Around 1995-1996, 
Applicant had delinquent debts because his disability pay was insufficient to repay his 
creditors. His delinquent, unsecured debts were discharged in 1997 using a Chapter 7 
Bankruptcy. The SOR lists ten debts totalling $12,066 that were at one time or another 
delinquent during the last four years. He failed to keep his accounts current and 
negotiate lesser payments when his income decreased, showing some financial 
irresponsibility and lack of judgment. When he returned to employment, he did not 
aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution. His history of delinquent debt raises 
sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. Serious 
medical problems caused his income to significantly decline, and his debts became 
delinquent. Ultimately, he paid his delinquent SOR debts. His remaining debts are 
current. He only has two credit cards and one has a zero balance, the other has a 
balance of about $500. The loans on both of his vehicles are paid. The Appeal Board 
has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
 
 
9 
 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
Applicant is a security agent. He is a high school graduate, but did not attend college. 
He is not sophisticated in the area of finance. He made mistakes, and debts became 
delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt payments by actually paying all of his 
delinquent SOR debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
He honorably served more than ten years on active duty as a U.S. Marine. He left active 
duty as a gunnery sergeant. He had demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and 
trustworthiness through many years of service to the U.S. Marines and to the 
Department of Defense through his employment with defense contractors. After 
weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the 
financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
he is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.k:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
