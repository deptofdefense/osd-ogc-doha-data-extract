Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
he has a history of financial problems or difficulties. Other than paying off a $3,507
judgment in 2009, he has made virtually no progress during the last two years resolving
the remaining three delinquent debts for more than $25,000, and he does not have a
realistic plan in place to do so. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from his history of
financial problems. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 20,1
2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and
it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations.   
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to me February 9, 2011. The hearing took place March 30, 2011. The transcript (Tr.)
was received April 7, 2011. 
The record was kept open for two weeks, until April 13, 2011, to provide
Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documentary information in support of his
case. To date, no such matters have been received. 
Findings of Fact
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he is indebted on four
delinquent debts for a total of approximately $30,000. His admissions are accepted as
findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial
evidence.  
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His educational
background includes attending a technical school during 2001–2005, although he did
not receive a degree. He began his current employment as a aircraft mechanic in March
2009, and he is seeking a security clearance in conjunction with this job.
His employment history includes military service in the U.S. Army and the Army
National Guard. He served on active duty in the Army during 1994–2000.  After his
honorable discharge, he served in a national guard unit for about two years, ending in
late 2002. While on active duty, he was trained as an aircraft mechanic and worked on
Chinook helicopters. 
Since 2002, Applicant has had several jobs and two periods of unemployment.2
From August 2002 to January 2004, he worked as an assembler at a car manufacturing
 Tr. 65–66. 3
 Tr. 77–79. 4
 This fact does not receive much weight because, based on this record, I have no idea how the mortgage5
lender determined that Applicant and his wife were creditworthy and approved for the mortgage loan.

company. He was laid off from the job and then unemployed from January 2004 to
February 2005. He was a full-time student at the technical school during this period. He
paid his school expenses and living expenses via the GI Bill, which he relied on as a
paycheck. From February 2005 to November 2006, he worked as a broadband
technician for a communications company. He left that job and relocated to another
state where he worked for a technology company from November 2006 to January
2009, when he was laid off due to lack of work. He was unemployed for about two
months before his began his current job, which required relocating to another state.   
Applicant’s first marriage ended in divorce in 1999. He has one child, a 13-year-
old son, from that marriage. He pays $400 monthly in child support for his son. He
remarried in 2000, and he and his wife have three children, born in 2000, 2003, and
2006. His wife has a part-time job, about 30-hours weekly, working at home handling
customer calls on behalf of a large hotel chain. Applicant was generally unfamiliar with
his overall financial situation, as his wife is primarily responsible for bill paying and
managing the household budget. For example, he did not know how much he or his wife
earned last year.  He and his wife purchased a home in August 2010.  The purchase3 4
price was about $175,000, and Applicant testified that they were able to obtain a
mortgage loan and make the purchase, with no down payment, without difficultly.  He5
did not present any documentary evidence concerning the mortgage loan. 
Applicant completed a security clearance application in January 2010. In doing
so, he disclosed six delinquent debts in response to the relevant question.  He provided6
additional information about his indebtedness and his financial situation during a
background interview in April 2010.  He attributed his delinquent debts to a combination7
of periods of unemployment and underemployment in the last ten years, the birth of his
three children, and expenses associated with job relocations. He reported essentially no
progress on resolving his indebtedness in response to Agency interrogatories in
September 2010.  8
At hearing, Applicant admitted he was indebted to four creditors for delinquent
debts alleged in the SOR for a total of approximately $30,000. Three of the four remain
unpaid and unresolved for more than $25,000. The debts are discussed below.

The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is for an unpaid $3,507 judgment that was taken against
Applicant in November 2008.  It was satisfied in full in March 2009.  9 10
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $1,038 collection account. The debt originated as
a credit card account, Applicant has made no payments on it in the recent past, and he
does not recall when the last payment was made.  It remains unpaid and unresolved. 11
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is for a $2,679 collection account. The debt appears to
have originated with another creditor.  Applicant or his wife have attempted to call the12
creditor, but have not made any material progress obtaining information about the
debt.  He has made no payments on it in the recent past. It remains unpaid and13
unresolved. 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $22,883 collection account. The debt originated as
a credit card account. Although Applicant agrees he is liable, he disputes the amount
owed, contending that the outstanding balance was less than $10,000, with the
remainder based on excessive fees and interest.  He did not present any documentary14
evidence concerning this debt or his dispute. But a February 2010 credit report does
have an entry of “consumer disputes this account information” for this debt.  15
Other than the satisfaction of judgment,  Applicant did not submit any16
documentary evidence concerning the debts or efforts made to repay or otherwise
resolve the debts. And he did not submit any documentary evidence concerning his
overall financial situation or his ability to repay the delinquent debts.  
Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to17
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to ath
security clearance).

because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As17
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt18
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An19
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting21
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An22
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate23
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme24
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.27
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 28
 See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an29
applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness
or recurring financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted).

for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it27
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant28
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline29
F is:
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  30
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties, and these matters are ongoing. This raises security concerns
because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not31
meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient32
to establish these two disqualifying conditions. 
7
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:  
¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The most pertinent here are ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d). I have considered all the mitigating
conditions in light of the evidence as a whole, and none, individually or in combination,
is sufficient to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming
from Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties. 
Except for a two-month period in early 2009, Applicant has had full-time
employment since February 2005, a period of more than five years. That should have
been enough time for Applicant to recover from his unemployment during 2004–2005,
when he was a full-time student supporting himself and his family via the GI Bill. To his
credit, he paid off the $3,507 judgment in March 2009. But in the last two years,
Applicant has done virtually nothing to repay or resolve the remaining three delinquent
debts for more than $25,000. What is missing here is responsible conduct coupled with
a good-faith effort during the last two years to repay or otherwise resolve the remaining
three delinquent debts. Had he, for example, paid or settled the two smaller debts and
made some sort of documented effort to repay, settle, or otherwise resolve the largest
debt, I would have been inclined to decide this case in his favor. Instead, there is no
documentary evidence of attempts to negotiate settlements, there is no documentary
evidence of a pattern of payments made as part of a realistic plan to repay the debts,
and there is no documentary evidence of even a token payment in the past two years.
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).33
8
Applicant’s good intentions and promises to pay in the future are insufficient to mitigate
the security concerns raised by his ongoing financial problems.  
To conclude, the evidence as a whole justifies current doubts about Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s33
favorable evidence, to include his honorable military service. Nevertheless, Applicant
did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
This case is decided against Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b–1.d: Against Applicant 
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
