HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges nine debts totaling $91,149. On 
October 8, 2015, he owed $65,205 in delinquent student loan debt. He has not made 
any voluntary payments to any SOR creditors since 2011. In 2013, his income was 
$147,000, and at that time he was unmarried, had no children, and did not cite any 
extraordinary circumstance that would have rendered him unable to voluntarily pay his 
SOR creditors anything. He did not make sufficient progress on his finances. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is 
denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On June 6, 2012, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaires 
for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On May 26,  
2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865,  
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not find under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
 
2 
                                         
 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 2) Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
  
On June 29, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR. On August 3, 2015, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On August 7, 2015, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for August 
27, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered 6 exhibits; Applicant offered 14 exhibits; and all exhibits were admitted 
without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 12-14; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-N)  
 
On September 10, 2015, I received a transcript of the hearing. The record was 
scheduled to close on September 25, 2015. (Tr. 128) On September 24, 2015, I granted 
an extension until October 25, 2015. (AE O) On October 23, 2015, Applicant provided 
12 additional exhibits and one hearing exhibit (Applicant’s counsel’s statement), which 
were admitted without objection. (HE 4; AE O-Z) On October 29, 2015, Department 
Counsel provided his written closing argument. (HE 5) The record closed on October 
29, 2015.   
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he acknowledged owing all of the debts in the SOR 
at some point in time. (HE 2) He also provided some extenuating and mitigating 
information. (HE 2) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.

1Applicant was confronted with his DD Form 214, which did not reflect award of a Meritorious 
Service Medal. (Tr. 113) Appellant explained he may have erred about receiving this award. (Tr. 114)  
 
3 
                                         
 
In June 2011, Applicant began his employment at an Army installation. (Tr. 37) 
He deployed to Afghanistan as a defense contractor from April 2013 to October 2013. 
(Tr. 38-39) In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded him a 40 percent 
disability rating for ringing in his ears and tension headaches. (Tr. 63) His current VA

expecting a baby in December 2015. (Tr. 68) He does not have any other children. (Tr. 
68-69)    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SF 86, 
SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges nine debts totaling 
$91,149. Applicant has not made any voluntary payments to any of the SOR creditors 
since 2011. (Tr. 114) The only payments made were interceptions by the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) of his federal tax refunds. (Tr. 114) 
 
Applicant’s June 6, 2012 SF 86 revealed the following information about his 
student loan delinquent debt: (1) he contacted the Department of Education (DOE) 
about his student loans and learned he owed about $55,000; (2) the DOE intercepted a 
$29,000 tax refund and applied $10,000 towards principal and the remainder for interest 
and penalties; (3) Applicant wrote the DOE questioning the allocation; and (4) Applicant 
could not afford the payments DOE sought. (GE 1) He also disclosed he owed debts to 
the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.g and 1.i. Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c 
was excessive; he lacked the funds to pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d; he did not recognize 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.i; he was trying to get his former spouse to pay the 
judgment in SOR 1.f; and he was contesting the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g because he did not 
believe he was responsible for the travel expenses. (GE 1)  
 
In 2001, Applicant purchased a home in state A for $122,500. (Tr. 41-43) In 2003 
or 2004, he refinanced the house and used the additional money to pay his credit-card 
debts. (Tr. 43) On January 7, 2002, his spouse provided a quit claim deed to Applicant. 
(Tr. 42; AE E) Applicant attempted to sell the home in 2008; however, he was unable to 
                                            
2At the time of Applicant’s hearing, he was under investigation for an alleged transfer of 
pornography files in July 2015 onto government computers on a closed-loop classified network. (Tr. 80, 
83, 87-88, 107-112) Applicant denied wrongdoing, and this allegation is not considered against him for 
any purpose. (Tr. 80, 118) At the time of his hearing, Applicant was on unpaid leave status. (Tr. 81) 
 
4 
                                         
 
do so because of the decline in real estate market values. (Tr. 43) He was never late 
more than 30 days on his mortgage payment, and he was current at the time of his 
hearing. (Tr. 53; AE F) He needed to move from state A for reasons of post-military 
retirement employment. At the time of his hearing, he had a tenant living in his home; 
however, the rent only covered about half of his house payment. (Tr. 62-63) At the time 
of Applicant’s hearing, he was considering selling his home in state A. (Tr. 69-70) On 
October 6, 2015, Applicant attended settlement on the sale of his home in state A for 
$170,000. (AE R) Applicant’s net after paying seller’s closing costs was $40,595. (AE R) 
On October 8, 2015, Applicant provided a $40,000 cashier’s check to his lawyer to hold 
in escrow for use to settle his debts. (AE S; HE 4)   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($37,833) and 1.b ($24,341) are student loan debts. Applicant said 
he owed about $58,000 to $64,000 on his student loans. (Tr. 44, 48-49) In 2008 and 
2009, he said he paid $800 monthly to address his student loans. (Tr. 44-45) He said he 
was working with his bank to obtain proof of those payments. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant said 
he was unable to make payments after he left active duty. (Tr. 45) In 2011 after 
returning from Afghanistan, he planned to “negotiate the debt” using his pay and tax 
refund. (Tr. 45) On May 20, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notified Applicant 
that the IRS intercepted his $18,790 tax refund, and it was applied to his student loan 
debt. (Tr. 45-46; AE C) About $7,500 was applied to the principal, and the remainder 
was applied to the interest and penalties owed. (Tr. 47) On March 1, 2013, the IRS 
again intercepted his $6,756 tax refund and applied it to his student loan debt. (Tr. 47; 
AE D) On July 22, 2013, the collection agent for DOE notified Applicant that his principal 
balance was $44,020; his interest owed was $803; and his penalty charges were 
$10,910. (Tr. 48; AE B) On October 8, 2015, the balance of the debt was $65,205. (HE 
4; AE V) The interest rate on the student loan is 4.625 percent. (HE 4; AE V) He has not 
attempted to set up a payment plan from 2011 to October 2015. (Tr. 49, 98) In October 
2015, the student loan creditor offered to settle the debt for $44,765, and Applicant has 
decided to settle the debt. (HE 4) Applicant had until December 22, 2015, to settle the 
debt. (HE 4) In sum, aside from the two garnishments by the IRS in 2011 and 2013, 
there is no evidence of any payments made to address his student loan debt of 
$65,205. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($4,385), ¶ 1.d ($3,448), ¶ 1.e ($1,960), and ¶ 1.i ($6,723) are three 
charged-off credit-card bank debts and one credit-card collection account, which 
became delinquent when Applicant left active duty in August 2009. (Tr. 50-53, 55, 93) 
Applicant has not received recent notice that the creditors are seeking repayment of the 
debts. (Tr. 51-54) SOR ¶ 1.i was sold or transferred, and his credit report shows a zero 
balance owed to the creditor. (Tr. 56) He has not received IRS Form 1099s for any of 
the four debts. (Tr. 92-93) On September 8, 2015, he contacted the creditor for the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.i, and he learned the debt is now $8,015. (HE 4; AE U) He has not made 
any payments on the four credit-card debts. (Tr. 94) He said he intends to pay them 
once he has the means to do so. (Tr. 94) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($5,201) resulted in December 2005, when Applicant’s former spouse 
sued him in small claims court and obtained a judgment. (Tr. 57; AE G) The suit was 
filed because she believed the allocation of credit-card debt in the divorce was unfair. 
 
5 
                                         
 
(Tr. 100) Interest accrues at the rate of 10 percent annually. (AE G) Applicant has no 
information about follow-up action to enforce the judgement through placing a lien on 
his property or garnishing his pay. (Tr. 58) He did not make any payments on the debt. 
(Tr. 100) He has not been in contact with his former spouse. (Tr. 58) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($5,224) is a claimed debt from Applicant’s employer. Applicant quit 
after 10 months of his 12-month Afghanistan deployment because he had a dispute with 
another contractor employee. (Tr. 34) The contractor employee threatened to kill 
Applicant. (HE 4) He submitted his resignation while he was still in Afghanistan. (Tr. 34-
35) His employer made flight arrangements for Applicant’s return to the United States, 
and did not tell Applicant he would be billed for the flight costs. (Tr. 35) After he returned 
to the United States, his former defense employer advised Applicant that he would be 
billed for the travel expenses because he was not an employee at the time of the travel. 
(Tr. 35-36) Applicant refused to pay for his travel, and the defense employer sent the 
debt to the credit reporting companies. The debt is not indicated on Applicant’s 2015 
credit report. (Tr. 59; GE 6) From 2012 to August 2015, he did not take any action to 
resolve the debt. (Tr. 73) Applicant’s employment contract included a clause indicating 
his repayment obligation may be excused. (HE 4; AE W; AE Y; AE Z) On August 28, 
2015, Applicant wrote the creditor and disputed his responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.g. (HE 4; AE T) 
 
According to Applicant, SOR ¶ 1.h ($2,034) is a duplicate of one of his other 
debts. (Tr. 54) It is not listed on his current credit report. (Tr. 54; GE 6) However, his 
earlier credit reports show the debt is an account that originated from a student loan. 
(Tr. 116; GE 3 at 2; GE 6 at 2) I find this debt is merged into his other student loan debt. 
(Tr. 119) 
 
In 2004, Applicant was on active duty, and he was seriously injured in a 
motorcycle accident. (Tr. 60-61) The government paid for Applicant’s medical care. (Tr. 
62) Applicant was unable to work for about eight months. (Tr. 62) He spent about 
$8,000 on two vacations outside of the United States. (Tr. 77) He has not received 
financial counseling. (Tr. 95) At the time of his hearing, he had not filed his federal 
income tax return for 2014. (Tr. 96) He has not filed tax returns where he is employed 
and living for the last several years because he is claiming residency in state A. (Tr. 
102-103) Applicant said he lacked the means to pay his debts. (Tr. 104) He planned to 
eventually consolidate and pay his debts. (Tr. 104)  
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant provided certificates and recommendations for several ARCOMs and 
Army Achievement Medals (AAM). (AE M) He also provided a 1996 Reserve Officer 
Training Corps (ROTC) certificate of appreciation. (AE M) He received an ARCOM for 
providing lifesaving CPR and first aid to a soldier severely injured in an accident on July 
12, 1998. (AE M at 27-28) In 2007, he received a Non-Article Five North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) Medal. (AE M at 33) Applicant received excellent evaluations for 
work as a defense contractor. (AE N)  
 
 
6 
                                         
 
 Two coworkers wrote that Applicant shows integrity, professionalism, and 
knowledge. (SOR response) He conscientiously protects classified information. (SOR 
response) Their statements support continuation of his security clearance.    
 
 Applicant’s Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214) 
shows the following awards and badges: one Global War on Terrorism Service Medal 
(GWTSM); one CAB; one Afghanistan Campaign Medal (ACM); five ARCOMs; five 
AAMs; one Army Good Conduct Medal (AGCM); two Overseas Service Ribbons (OSR); 
one Armed Forces Reserve Medal (AFRM) with M Device; three Noncommissioned 
Officer Professional Development Ribbons (NCOPDR); two Army Reserve Components 
Achievement Medals (ARCAM); one Army Service Ribbon (ASR); two National Defense 
Service Medals (NDSM); and one Driver and Mechanic Badge. (AE M at 1-2)  
 
Policies 
  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
This decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination 
about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security 
clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
7 
                                         
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his credit reports, SF 86, SOR response, and hearing record. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges, and the evidence establishes nine debts totaling about 
$90,000. On October 8, 2015, his $65,205 in student loan debt was delinquent. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
8 
                                         
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

($24,341), and 1.h ($2,034) are all student loans that are merged into SOR ¶ 1.a, which 
is a $65,205 delinquent student loan debt. AG ¶¶ 1.b and 1.h are found for Applicant. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g which Applicant’s former employer 
alleged Applicant owed for transportation from Afghanistan back to the United States. 
Applicant has reasonably disputed the debt.   
 
Applicant also receives some credit because of variations in income, decline of 
the real estate market in state A, and needing to move to a different state for 
employment. Resolving debts is more difficult while deployed overseas. These are all 
circumstances beyond his control which adversely affected his finances. He did not 
receive financial counseling.  
 
When Applicant submitted his June 6, 2012 SF 86, he revealed that he was 
aware of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g and 1.i. The only payment made after he 
submitted this SF 86 was the tax refund the IRS intercepted in 2013. On May 26, 2015, 
the SOR was issued, and Applicant learned that his failure to file his tax returns raised a 
security concern. He has made some progress discovering how he can settle some 
debts; however, as of the close of the record, no payments were made to his SOR 
creditors. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.

Applicant has achieved important employment goals, demonstrating some self-
discipline, responsibility, and dedication; however, this evidence is insufficient to 
mitigate security concerns. Applicant is a 44-year-old field system engineer, who has 
been employed by defense contractors since 2009. He honorably served in the Army for 
20 years, and he retired as a sergeant first class. He served two overseas tours, 
including one in Afghanistan. He has the equivalent of 16 years active duty service.  In 
2012, the VA awarded him a 40 percent disability rating. From 2006 to 2014, Applicant 
was deployed to Afghanistan for 46 months. Applicant is credited with mitigating SOR 
¶¶ 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h. 
 
Applicant provided a 1996 ROTC certificate of appreciation. Applicant received 
excellent evaluations for work as a defense contractor. Two coworkers lauded 
Applicant’s character, and their statements support continuation of his security 
clearance.    
 
Applicant has earned the following awards and badges: one GWTSM; one CAB; 
one ACM; five ARCOMs; five AAMs; one AGCM; two OSRs; one AFRM with M Device; 
three NCOPDRs; two ARCAMs; one ASR; two NDSMs; and one Driver and Mechanic 
Badge. One of his ARCOMs was for providing lifesaving CPR and first aid to a soldier 
seriously injured in an accident. In 2007, he received a Non-Article Five NATO Medal.   
 
The adverse financial information is more significant. Applicant owes about 
$90,000 of delinquent debt. On October 8, 2015, he owed $65,205 in delinquent student 
loan debt. He did not make any voluntary payments to any SOR creditors since 2011. In 
2013, his income was $147,000, and at that time he was unmarried, had no children, 
and did not cite any extraordinary circumstances of sufficient magnitude to render him 
unable to voluntarily pay his SOR creditors anything. He did not make sufficient 
progress on his finances.  
 
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c to 1.f:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:   Against Applicant  
 
11 
                                         
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
