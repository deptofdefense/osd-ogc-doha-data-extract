Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He has a history of financial problems or
difficulties consisting of eight delinquent accounts for a total of more than $50,000. He
has made a good-faith effort to address his financial problems by resolving seven of the
eight accounts, and it is most probable that the eighth account will be resolved within
the next year. He met his burden to present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on April 8, 2014.  After reviewing the application and1
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information gathered during a background investigation, the DOD,  on December 3,2
2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that
it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to
classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the3
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He
answered the SOR on December 29, 2014, and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on March 25, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1 and 2, and they
were admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A, B, C, E, F, H, I, J, and K, and they were
admitted. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on April 1, 2015.
The record was kept open until April 15, 2015, to provide Applicant an
opportunity to submit additional documentation. Those matters (to include his
explanatory e-mail) were timely submitted and they are admitted, without objections, as
Exhibits A–1, B–1, B–2, C–1, G, H–1, L, and M. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 43-year-old systems engineer for a federal contractor. He is
seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him. He has worked for his
current employer, a major defense contractor, since 2004. His work involves the
integration of software and hardware in a laboratory environment. His annual salary is
about $100,000.
Applicant’s employment history includes serving on active duty in the U.S.
military from November 1989 to June 1995. Upon his honorable discharge from military
service, he elected to pursue higher education by attending a local community college.
He earned an associate’s degree in 1999, and then enrolled in a state university. He
earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in December 2002, but he had
difficultly finding employment as an engineer. He kept his job at the university, which he
started in January 2002, and continued working as an electronics technician until early
2004, when he began his current job. He has a good record of employment based on
performance evaluations from 2013 and 2014.4

Applicant married in 2010. As a result, he has two stepchildren, ages 16 and 14.
His wife is a full-time student who is pursuing a doctoral degree in chemistry.  She is5
using student loans to pay for school expenses, and she earns an income working as a
teaching assistant at the university. 
The SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts for a total of more than $50,000,
which Applicant does not dispute. He attributed the delinquent accounts to putting
himself through school without a good understanding of the student loan system, which
led him to pay for much of his school and living expenses by using credit cards.  He6
also points to the 2002 period, when he had difficultly finding a job as an engineer due
to fallout from the dot-com bubble and stock market crash of 2000–2002.  His marriage7
in 2010 and new family with two teenage children also slowed his efforts.  8
Applicant met with a bankruptcy attorney in 2009, who advised him to maximize
his contribution to his 401(k) account because that money would be protected in a
bankruptcy case.  He paid the first half of the fee to retain the attorney, but then decided9
not to pursue bankruptcy. Instead, he continued maximizing his contribution to the
401(k) account with the idea to use those funds to settle the debts via lump-sum
payments as opposed to installment repayment agreements. 
Applicant submitted documentary evidence that he has resolved seven of the
eight accounts.  The status of each account is summarized in the following table.10

(Exhibits H and H–1)
In brief, Applicant resolved seven of the eight delinquent accounts by (1) paying in full
the two minor medical collection accounts, (2) bringing the past-due student loan
current, and (3) settling four accounts for a total of $23,349. He was able to do so by
withdrawing about $25,000 from his 401(k) account.  11
Applicant is waiting to address the unresolved collection account until later in the
year or the first quarter of next year. He is waiting because he expects to receive an
income tax bill (based on the early withdrawal from the 401(k) account as well as Form
1099s due to the settlements for lesser amounts), and so he wants to reserve sufficient
funds to pay taxes.  12
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As13
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt14
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An15

unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  16
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting17
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An18
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate19
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  20
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s21
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.22
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. The
Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those
persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it23
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant24
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 25
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  26
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning27 28
of Guideline F. 
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and29
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 30
7
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved and is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties goes back several years, to
at least 2009, when he considered bankruptcy as a means to address his indebtedness.
Five of the eight delinquent accounts stem from unsecured credit card accounts that he
used to finance his education and living expenses when he was a student. He allowed
those matters to remain unresolved while he accumulated money in his 401(k) account
to address it via lump-sum payments. He should have acted with more diligence and
haste in resolving the delinquent accounts, but his marriage in 2010 and instant family
consisting of two teenagers was a factor in delaying his efforts. 
Nevertheless, he has now resolved seven of the eight delinquent accounts in the
SOR, and he has a reasonable plan to resolve the eighth in the foreseeable future. He
did so at some financial detriment to himself, because making an early withdrawal from
a 401(k) account is subject to current income taxes in addition to a 10% penalty, and is
contrary to the central principles of long-term investing. Doing so also shows that
Applicant is acting in good faith.  
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather, the30
purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the
Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 31
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).32
8
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.31
Here, the evidence clearly supports a conclusion that Applicant has established a
plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that
plan. He has established a meaningful track record of actual debt reduction by resolving
seven of the eight delinquent accounts in the SOR, and he has a reasonable plan to
resolve the eighth within the next year. Those actions, along with his explanations
concerning how he incurred the indebtedness and why he delayed in resolving it, are
sufficient to mitigate the concern.  
Applicant met his burden to present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. I have no doubts about his reliability,
trustworthiness, and good judgment. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence
as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.32
Accordingly, I conclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to
classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.h: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility is granted.
