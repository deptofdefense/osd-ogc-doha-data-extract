Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP), on September 19, 2006. On December 20, 2007, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On January 9, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 
31, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 1, 2008 
and transferred to me on July 9, 2008. In January 2008, it was discovered that Applicant 
was working in Iraq. He did not return to the U.S. on leave until November 2008. On 
October 21, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for 
November 18, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered five 
 
2 
 
 
exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 5 without objection. 
Applicant testified and offered five exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) A – E without objection. The record was held open until December 19, 2008, to 
allow Applicant to submit additional documents. No additional documents were 
submitted. The transcript was received on December 4, 2008. Based upon a review of 
the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j.  
He denies SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n and 1.o. 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old help desk administrator employed with a Department 
of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the 
defense contractor since October 2006. He is a police academy graduate and has a 
high school diploma. He served on active duty in the United States Army from 1994 to 
1995. He was injured during basic training and was medically discharged with an 
honorable discharge. He married his first wife in December 1992. They divorced in June 
2000. A daughter was born of the marriage, now age 13. His first wife passed away on 
September 11, 2002. He married his second wife in February 2002. They divorced in 
September 2004. A daughter was born of the marriage, now age 6. He married his 
current wife in August 2006. She has an eight-year-old daughter. Applicant and his 
current wife have a two-year-old son. His six-year-old daughter lives with her mother. 
His 13-year-old daughter, 8-year-old stepdaughter, and two-year-old son live with 
Applicant and his wife. (Tr at 4-6, 27-28, 30, 35, 63, 65-66; Gov 1; AE A.) 
 
Applicant has worked as a contractor in Iraq since March 2005. From February 
2005 to March 2006, he worked for a previous contractor. He was sent back early as a 
result of medical issues related to a spider bite. He accepted his current position in 
October 2006. He has been assigned to Iraq since that time and will be in Iraq until 
October 2009.  He was home on leave at the time of the hearing. (Tr at 34-37.) 
   
On September 19, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) He disclosed several delinquent debts in 
response to section 27 on his questionnaire. Credit Reports obtained during Applicant’s  
subsequent background investigation listed the following delinquent accounts: a $136 
medical account placed for collection in January 2000 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 
3,6,10; Gov 5 at 3. 8, 12); a $115 medical account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 
4 at 3, 8, 10, 13); a $4,629 medical account owed to a hospital, placed for collection in 
October 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9, 10, 12, 14; Gov 5 at 11, 15, 17); a 
$1,070 medical account placed for collection in September 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 3 at 
2; Gov 4 at 5, 10, 13; Gov 5 at 3, 16); a $3,995 credit card account that was placed for 
collection in January 2000 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 5 at 5); and a $3,476 debt owed to a credit 
card placed for collection in February 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.f:  Gov 4 at 11; Gov 5 at 3, 5, 13). 
 
3 
 
 
Additional debts include a $12,718 debt owed from an automobile repossession 
charged off as a bad debt in February 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 3 at 1, 3; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 
5 at 5); a $28,221 debt owed as result of a truck repossession charged off as a bad debt 
in September 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 4 at 6; Gov 5 at 7); a $3,030 debt owed on an 
automobile placed for collection in September 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 4 at 8; Gov 5 at 
10); a $3,770 debt owed on an apartment lease, placed for collection in October 2006 
(SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 6, 12); a $253 cell phone account charged off as a bad 
debt in March 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.k:  Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9; Gov 5 at 10); a $484 telephone 
account placed for collection in April 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 4 at 12; Gov 5 at 9, 15); a 
$723 electric utility account charged off as a bad debt in October 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 
3 at 3; Gov 4 at 8); a $621 satellite television account placed for collection in October 
2004 (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 4 at 4, 11, 13; Gov 5 at 4, 12); and a $496 Direct TV account, 
placed for collection in July 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.o: Gov 4 at 11, 13; Gov 5 at 11, 15, 17). 
 
Applicant had several periods of unemployment since 1995. He was unemployed 
for six months after separating from the U.S. Army in 1995. (Tr at 64.) In 1998, his 
employer laid him off and he was unemployed for six months. (Tr at 57, 64-65.) From 
March 2006 to October 2006, he was unemployed for six months after being injured by 
the spider bite in Iraq. He has a pending workmen’s compensation claim with the 
company. (Tr at 35.) His periods of unemployment contributed to his financial problems 
but he also admits some of his financial problems were due to mismanagement. (Tr at 
56; Gov 1, Additional Comments section.) 
 
In 1995, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He claims that he completed 
the wage earner plan in 1998. (Tr at 38.) He claims the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 
and 1.i were included in the bankruptcy. Applicant testified that he would obtain a copy 
of his bankruptcy and submit it post-hearing. (Tr at 40-41, 50.) No documents were 
submitted after the hearing. He also claimed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.i 
were the responsibility of his first ex-wife, who is now deceased. He provided a copy of 
the automobile title pertaining to the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i indicating no liens on the 
automobile. He has provided sufficient evidence to indicate these debts belonged to his 
first ex-wife. SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.i are found for Applicant. (TR at 17, 38-40; AE A; Answer 
to SOR.) 
 
Applicant claims the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.b are medical accounts 
incurred by his current wife prior to their marriage. (Tr at 29-31.) SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are 
found for Applicant. 
 
He is waiting for a settlement offer related to the $4,629 medical debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.c.  In October 2002, he injured his ankle and had no medical insurance. The 
company was contacted in November 2007 to inquire about a settlement. His wife 
allegedly made a couple of phone calls since that time about a potential settlement. 
Applicant has not heard anything about a possible settlement. He has not made any 
payments towards the account because he is waiting for a settlement offer. (Tr at 32-
33.)  
 
 
4 
 
 
Applicant admits that he owes the $1,072 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. He 
has made no contact with the creditor. (Tr at 33.)  
 
Applicant disputes the $3,476 credit card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. He 
claims that it was a company credit card and a previous employer is responsible for the 
account. He is trying to contact the previous employer in order to get the account 
removed from his credit report. The last time he contacted them was in early 2008. (Tr 
at 42-25.) 
 
The $12,718 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g was a truck loan. Applicant could not 
make the truck payments after he was laid off. He arranged to have a friend take over 
the truck payments. His friend did not make the truck payments and the truck was 
repossessed. The loan was in Applicant’s name. He is trying to locate the company  
collecting on the debt. (Tr at 46-48.) 
 
The $28,221 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h was an automobile loan. The car was 
repossessed in 2004. Applicant is not sure who is currently collecting on the debt.   
 
Applicant is currently waiting for a settlement offer related to the $3,770 amount 
owed on an apartment lease (SOR ¶ 1.j). He has made no payments on the debt. He 
and his wife moved out of the apartment before their lease was up after his wife slipped 
on the stairs while pregnant. They had complained to the landlord several times about 
problems with the entry way but the landlord did not correct the problem. (Tr at 50.) 
 
Applicant denies the $253 telephone account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k.  He has no 
knowledge of the account. (Tr at 52; Answer to SOR.)  
 
Applicant claims the $484 telephone debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l and the $723 
utility account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m was opened by his second ex-wife. He admits that 
the accounts were joint accounts and accepted responsibility for the accounts at 
hearing. (Tr at 53-54.) No payments have been made towards either account.  
 
Applicant claims the $621 satellite television account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n is paid 
but provided no receipts at the close of the record. (Tr at 55; Answer to SOR.) 
 
Applicant denies the $496 Direct TV account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o. He claims he 
never had a Direct TV account. (Tr at 55.) 
 
In late 2006/early 2007, Applicant contracted a law firm to dispute several of the 
accounts listed on his credit reports, including SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.o. He contacted them 
four days prior to the hearing but has not heard anything about the status of the firm’s 
progress. (Tr at 52, 59.) He provided no documentation after the hearing pertaining to 
his agreement with the law firm. 
 
Applicant is taking an online financial credit counseling course. He intends to 
take a money management class when he returns to Iraq. (Tr at 60.) He recently 
 
5 
 
 
consulted consumer credit counseling. He intends to allocate $1,500 out of his 
paycheck towards his delinquent accounts. He claims he was too busy to resolve his 
financial situation while in Iraq. (Tr at 66-67; AE D.) No documentation was provided to 
indicate that an agreement has been created or when it will take effect.  
 
Applicant and his wife were concerned about a letter they received which they 
believe was an attempt to steal his identity. It was addressed to a bank located in a 
country that is a US territory.  The letter asked that his credit rating be reconsidered and 
has his social security number on the account. Neither Applicant or his wife mailed the 
letter. It was returned to their address because there was no such address for the bank. 
They took actions to monitor their credit reports and it appears no unauthorized 
accounts had been opened. (Tr at 24; AE E.)    
 
In response to interrogatories, dated October 22, 2007, Applicant completed a 
personal financial statement. His net monthly take home pay was $7,000. He listed 
approximately $4,283 in monthly expenses. He has approximately $2,717 in 
discretionary income left over each month after expenses. (Gov 2.) At hearing, 
Applicant testified these numbers are no longer accurate. He was given the option to  
provide an updated statement with his post-hearing submissions. No updated budget 
was provided. His wife is a full-time student and does not work. (Tr at 61-62, 70.)    
 
Applicant submitted numerous letters of recommendation commending his 
service while working in Iraq and his overall character. (AE B at 1-7.)      
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
6 
 
 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case.  Applicant has accumulated a significant 
amount of delinquent debt since 2000. Previous financial problems resulted in a 1995 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. The SOR alleges 15 debts, an approximate total balance 
of $63,739.   
 
 
7 
 
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While 
Applicant states he retained a law firm to assist him in removing disputed debts off his 
credit report in late 2006/early 2007, he provided no indication of the law firm’s 
progress. The majority of the accounts remain unresolved.  While he has made sporadic 
attempts to resolve his financial situation, he has not established a plan to resolve his 
debts.  
   
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant had several 
periods of unemployment which contributed to his financial problems. However, he has 
been continuously employed in Iraq since October 2006, earning enough income to be 
able to begin to resolve his financial situation. At the close of the record, no proof was 
provided that any of the delinquent accounts which were Applicant’s responsibility were 
resolved.  I cannot conclude Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.    
 
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. When he returned from Iraq on leave, Applicant consulted 
consumer credit counseling. He intends to allocate $1,500 out of his paycheck to pay 
towards his delinquent debts. He provided no proof at the close of the record that this 
action was completed. Even if it were completed, it is too soon to conclude Applicant’s 
financial situation has stabilized due to his history of financial irresponsibility and no 
proof that any payments have been made towards his delinquent accounts. Given the 
extent of the debt it will take some time for the delinquent debts to be resolved.  
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant presented sufficient 
evidence that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i were not his 
responsibility. Aside from these debts, approximately $50,410 of unresolved delinquent 
debt remains. Applicant testified that he is beginning to resolve his delinquent accounts. 
The record was held open to allow him to submit documentation to corroborate his 
efforts. Nothing was submitted. I cannot conclude Applicant initiated a good-faith effort 
to resolve his delinquent accounts based on a lack of documentation.  
 
8 
 
 
FC MC ¶20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue) applies with respect SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i. Applicant provided sufficient 
documentary evidence to support that these debts were not his responsibility.  He did 
not provide sufficient evidence to support his disputes with the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.f, 1.k, 1.l. 1.m, and 1.o.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable 
comments of Applicant’s friends and co-workers. I considered Applicant’s periods of 
unemployment. However, Applicant’s financial situation has been relatively stable since 
October 2006. Although Applicant intends to pay off his delinquent accounts, he 
provided insufficient evidence to establish that he has taken action to resolve his 
delinquent accounts. A promise to pay in the future does not mitigate the security 
concerns raised based on Applicant’s past financial history. Applicant has not mitigated 
the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  
 
    Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
 
9 
 
 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.m:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o:    Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
