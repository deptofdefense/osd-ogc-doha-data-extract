LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record shows Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties as evidenced by current and past collection
accounts, a student loan collection account, and an unpaid judgment on which he has
made no payments since the judgment was entered in 2005. Sixteen delinquent debts
for about $16,000 remain unpaid. Although the student loan was rehabilitated and he
paid three small collection accounts, the record contains insufficient evidence to explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case
is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (Revised Guidelines), which were made effective within the Defense Department on September
1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense1
Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to
Applicant on June 12, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the
factual basis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR
recommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination
whether to deny or revoke Applicant’s security clearance.  
Applicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a hearing.
The case was assigned to me on August 5, 2009. The hearing took place September
21, 2009. The record was left open until October 5, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission, and the post-
hearing matters are marked and admitted, without objections, as follows: Exhibit
E–student loan documents (four pages); and Exhibit F–two letters of recommendation.
The transcript (Tr.) was received September 29, 2009. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 31-year-old aircraft mechanic who is employed by federal
contractor. He began his current employment in October 2007, and he completed a
security-clearance application in October 2008.  This is the first time he has applied for2
an industrial security clearance.  3
   
Applicant married in 1998, and he divorced in 2002. He has two children from the
marriage, ages 9 and 11, and both children have lived with him since the divorce. He is
currently living with his fiancée. 
His employment history includes periods of unemployment during 2001–2005,
and for a three-month period in 2006. The first period of unemployment coincided with
his attendance at a technical college during 2002–2004. After earning his degree or
certificate as an airframe and power plant (A & P) mechanic in December 2004, he
began his first job, as a contract employee, working as an A & P mechanic in
September 2005. He was laid off in May 2006. He resumed employment, again as a
contract employee, in July 2006, working as an A & P mechanic until he began his

current job as an aircraft mechanic in October 2007. Applicant describes his current job
as his best-paying and most-stable employment.  
The SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $25 to $14,730,
for a total of approximately $31,000. In his answer, Applicant admitted 15 debts, denied
5 debts, and provided some brief explanations. The debts, which are established by an
October 2008 credit report,  include an unpaid judgment for $1,412 and a student loan4
account in collection for $14,730. The current status of the debts is summarized in the
following table.5

To sum up, Applicant paid three small debts for a total of $189, and he rehabilitated the
student loan account, payment of which is now deferred. Sixteen delinquent debts for
about $16,000 remain unpaid. 
In March 2009, Applicant applied for a consolidation loan via a credit card
account with a major bank in an effort to address his unpaid delinquent debts (Exhibit
B). The bank denied his application due to his derogatory credit history (Exhibit 2). One
month later, Applicant sought consumer counseling from a nonprofit organization, and
the counselor recommended consolidating the debts into a debt-management plan
requiring a $480 monthly payment, which was beyond Applicant’s ability to pay (Exhibits
B and 2). 
In general, Applicant’s plan is to save money in a separate account that he will
use to repay his delinquent debts. He believes this approach will work best as it will
allow him to accumulate enough money to negotiate lump-sum settlements, paying off
his creditors one at a time. He attributes his financial problems to his divorce in 2002,
and his periods of unemployment and unstable employment. He was able to make
forward progress on resolving his financial problems since obtaining his current job in
October 2007.  6

Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is
to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As7
noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,8
any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified
information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An9
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  10
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting11
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An12
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate13
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme14
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15
The Agency’s appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.17
 Revised Guidelines, ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating18
conditions). 
 Revised Guidelines, ¶ 18.  19
 Revised Guidelines, ¶ 19(a).  20
 Revised Guidelines, ¶ 19(c). 21

The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant
and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-
person concept. 
A person granted access to classified information enters into a special
relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree
of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified
information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination
of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the17
strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant18
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security
concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under
Guideline F is that: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  19
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information.   
The record supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of20 21
 Revised Guidelines, ¶ 20 (a) – (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). 22
7
Guideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions, and they suggest some financial irresponsibility as well.
Under ¶ 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security
concerns.  Of the six conditions, three apply in Applicant’s favor as follows: 22
(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control; and 
(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts.
First, ¶ 20(b) applies because Applicant’s financial difficulties were largely due to
his divorce, his status as a single parent, and his periods of unemployment and
unstable employment, all of which were circumstances largely beyond his control.
Second, ¶ 20(c) applies because there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial
problems, while ongoing, are being resolved, which will take time. And third, ¶ 20(d)
applies because Applicant has made some progress in resolving his delinquent
indebtedness. Most significantly, he rehabilitated the student loan collection account by
making several monthly payments resulting in repurchase of the account by Sallie Mae.
He also paid three small collection accounts, and he has a general plan to address his
other debts. Given these circumstances, I conclude Applicant initiated a good-faith effort
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
Although Applicant deserves credit for his efforts, the credit in mitigation is
insufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by his history of financial
difficulties. His history includes current and past collection accounts, a defaulted student
loan account, and an unpaid judgment on which he has made no payments since the
judgment was entered in 2005. Sixteen delinquent debts for about $16,000 remain
unpaid. Looking forward, based on his limited track record of repayment, it is too soon
to tell if Applicant will resolve his delinquent debts in the near future and if additional
financial problems will not recur. 
To conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant’s history of
financial difficulties create current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate
the security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-
 Revised Guidelines, ¶ 2(a)(1) – (9).23

factor whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence, including his23
favorable character references.  Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of24
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against
Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of
Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j, 1.k, 1.I, and 1.p: For Applicant
Remaining Subparagraphs: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
